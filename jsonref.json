She added that “he’s well within his authority to act in that manner”, because “each pastor has canonical authority to make such decisions for his parish school”.According to the paper, the books were on shelves until the end of the previous term, but the school has just opened a new library from which they were removed.“I know that in the process they were going through and kind of weeding out some of the content in hopes of sprucing it up and improving the circulation,” said Hammel, adding that if parents deemed the stories “to be appropriate we would hope that they would just guide their sons and daughters to understand the content through the lens of our faith”.She added: “We really don’t get into censorship in such selections other than making sure that what we put in our school libraries are age-appropriate materials for our classrooms.”The Harry Potter books have drawn censure from Christians ever since the first in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, was released in 1997. In 1999, it was the most challenged book in the US, and the series topped the American Library Association’s list of the most frequently challenged books of 2000-2009.Challengers asserted that the books “glorified magic and the occult, confusing children and leading them to attempt to emulate the spells and curses they read about”, said the ALA. In 2001, the pastor of Christ Community Church in Alamogordo, New Mexico oversaw a book burning of the Potter books, and a local library responded with a dedicated display, telling the public that “Harry is alive and well at their library”.While he was still a cardinal in 2003, the future Pope Benedict XVI described the books as “subtle seductions which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the soul before it can grow properly”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82063961c4bdaea6caa9f08e326396a4fa6440ee/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c84bdfce9dfee7674f0e875b9ea9e4c","title":"bank hsbc uk homebuyers bank mortgage","story":"Battle between lenders intensifies as bank seeks bigger share of mortgage market•HSBC’s £35bn mortgage push is good for borrowers, but it’s riskyHSBC is to lend an extra £35bn to homeowners, further intensifying the battle among mortgage lenders to offer ultra-competitive deals to customers.Rivals have claimed that HSBC’s aggressive push into the mortgage market will squeeze profit margins in the sector amid intense competition for customers.The result has been a boon to mortgage hunters seeking good deals but has forced some lenders, such as Tesco Bank and the consumer body Which?, to quit the mortgage market.“There are many critics, usually other banks, saying that we are being overly competitive in the market, and we are desperately trying to get share,” said Stuart.The number of new home loan deals that offer some sort of incentive to pull in customers, such as cashback, free valuation or free legal fees, have risen sharply as competition has intensified.In May, the financial data provider Moneyfacts said there were 1,518 mortgages offering an added incentive, significantly up from the 920 in the same month in 2017.Stuart said the bank’s mortgage strategy was based on efficiency and customer service, not just attempting to out-price rivals with cheaper deals. “Rather than taking seven weeks to get a mortgage, it now takes you about five days – that’s pretty slick,” he said. “It’s not a price-driven strategy it’s a good quality products, well executed strategy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e236e820f4607243b9ed8f2809e3bcccf9f7c29/0_122_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ecdf44611f7903732e7c2a808254cc","title":"uk factory output brexit eu manufacturers","story":"Survey finds EU-based firms shunning UK manufacturers as risk of no deal mountsThe UK’s manufacturers have recorded the sharpest drop in factory output for seven years as mounting concerns over no-deal Brexit and the slowing global economy hit orders across the country.The monthly snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which is closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signals from the UK economy, showed that activity plunged in August to the lowest levels since July 2012.The report found that EU-based customers are shunning British manufacturers as the risk of no-deal Brexit mounts, rerouting supply chains away from the UK as the likelihood of border disruption after 31 October increases.Orders from the US and Asia have fallen as the world economy slows, in a sign of the tough challenge facing the UKto strike new trade deals outside the economic bloc.The IHS MarkitCips manufacturers purchasing managers’ index (PMI) plunged to 47.4 in August, down from 48.0 a month earlier. Anything above 50.0 separates economic growth from contraction.Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: “The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.”Neil Foster, a research and policy officer at the GMB trade union, said: “Crashing out of the EU without a deal would cause mayhem, delays and increase costs for our importers, exporters and their supply chains.“The government should be working to rebuild confidence, instead ministers are risking more and more decent manufacturing jobs with their reckless approach.”There were steep reductions in new orders across several industries, against a backdrop of heightened political chaos and falling export demand across the world amid the US-China trade war.Global factory output has plunged into recession in recent months as the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies intensifies, which has dented economic growth in several major industrialised nations.The UK has fallen to the bottom of the G7 growth league table, while growth in Germany has gone into reverse and Italy stalled over the second quarter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61148ad30ebd99631c4846a4477afeb0d8e95035/0_0_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57433b45cd8be67475bfb7bedda57236","title":"austerity is a political choice not an economic necessity","story":"Neoliberal economists present themselves as ‘neutral’ technocrats, but they’re actually partisans for the status quo. Don’t fall for itThe outcome of austerity policies in Britain and elsewhere has become painfully clear: increased child poverty and social misery declining life expectancy an increase in racial inequality decaying public schools and public health and other public services and all-around catastrophe for disabled people.Yet the Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf recently recommended the book Austerity: When it Works and When it Doesn’t as his top book to read this summer. The book is a qualified defense of austerity policies written by Alberto Alesina, Carlo Favero, and Francesco Giavazzi, an influential trio of economists and rising stars known for advising major economic institutions. “This is an extremely important book,” Wolf said. The economist Kenneth Rogoff agreed, recently describing Austerity as “a towering scholarly achievement.”We agree with Wolff that this is an extremely important book but not because of its scholarly achievements as Rogoff claims, but rather because of its ideological character that serves to unabashedly justify oppressive neoliberal policies that are still being implemented worldwide.Alesina and his co-authors attempt to save austerity from its demise by positing an empirical distinction between two types of austerity. One, based on tax increases, hurts the economy they say, while the other, based on spending cuts, has less recessionary effects and can even expand the economy. By putting forth this distinction, the authors end up defending the harmful economic policies occurring in most Western countries, including the US: aggressive cuts to taxes (especially to corporate taxes) and to public welfare expenditure.In other words, this book – and its public acclamation in the mainstream media - is a telling example of the way in which neoliberal economic discourse is rendered technical and seemingly “depoliticized” in order to justify coercive state policies in favor of the one percent.Through technical language and appeals to science and expertise, neoliberal economic prescriptions are presented as “natural givens” that society must accept as matters of fact. Economists can therefore claim to be neutral scientific commentators rather than ideologues of the status quo – and technocrats can treat those economists’ prescriptions as indisputable and inevitable.This is most visible in the book’s emphasis on economic growth and its tendency to ignore class differences in favor of a vaguely defined general or national interest. For economic experts like Alesina, Favero and Giavazzi, the sole criterion that matters seems to be the effect of austerity on GDP. Their preference for this metric is a reminder of just how out of touch they are with the real-life needs of most citizens.This preoccupation with GDP growth fails to ask an important question: for whom, exactly, is GDP growth beneficial? There is no automatic correlation between GDP growth and prosperity for everyone. According to the standard neoliberal argument, cutting welfare expenditure lowers taxes and increases the pool of wealth available for private investment. This line of thinking is based on the strange assumption that the interests of the top one percent and the interests of the nation as a whole are the same, and that the rest of us should stomach harsh cuts to social spending while waiting for wealth to spread to ordinary people.Neoliberal rhetoric always disguises the coercion underlying austerity - a policy agenda to enhance capitalist growth while reallocating the burden of capitalism’s failures to the majority of the population. This requires the subordination of the working people by rising unemployment, forcing wage cuts, cutting welfare expenditures, eroding social solidarities, demonizing immigrants, tearing apart communities and ultimately increasing levels of exploitation.We must never forget that the fundamental question is not “when does austerity work and when doesn’t it?” but “for whom does austerity work, and for whom doesn’t it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e5953626c25cb9a0fe9eab659805220ef6d924d/249_0_2803_1683/master/2803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b04086b16918d7943768ac1e0d4acb","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smoky","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smoky’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smoky’.Share your photos of what smoky means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 4 September at 10am.

We can thank Canadian institution Tim Hortons for the doughnut obsession. The shop, founded by the NHL defenseman of the same name, opened in 1964 and became a million-dollar-a-year franchise, outselling most (if not all) fast-food chains. If you’re feeling nostalgic, visit the original in Hamilton, Ontario or take a trip to independent doughnut chain, Donut Monster, also in the city, where yeast-risen rounds are topped with seasonal flavours. Our favourite to date has to be the brownie cheesecake! But if you’re not in Ontario, check out Lucky’s Doughnuts at the 49th Parallel Café in BC or family-owned business, Bronuts in Winnipeg. They use natural ingredients and have been known to offer unique flavours such as roasted garlic and asiago cheese or rosemary and lavender. We have to wonder what Homer Simpson would order!Want a polar bear-shaped number plate? You’ll have to move to, or at least visit, the Northwest Territories to make it happenIn Canada’s Northwest Territories, polar bears abound – in the form of number plates. In 1970, to celebrate the centennial of Northwest Territories, the government introduced a number plate shaped like a polar bear. Sure, some may have thought it was unusual at first. But since then, many have become delighted and wanted one for themselves. Pro tip: we’ve seen some vintage plates sold on eBay.If you want to branch out into road signs, then there are more than 77,000 to be seen at Watson Lake Signpost Forest.

Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a “giant snake” about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018. From the lake, drive to the Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery to learn a bit more about western Canada’s oldest craft distillery, and take a whisky tour. Alternatively, check out one of the latest local theatre shows at the Caravan Farm Theatre under the stars. Located on a 32-hectare (80-acre) farm, it’s a hidden treasure and one of the best ways to support local artists. If you want to see if you can sneak a peek of Ogopogo, why not try scuba ing at Fintry provincial park? It also houses a sunken Canadian Pacific Railway barge, should you not get lucky with the monster.Did you know that Santa Claus had a legitimate postal address?

Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being “Parva sub ingenti” (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across – and endless fun.For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins. So, while they worked to produce more, playing cards were used as currencyIn the late 1600s, coins arriving from France were in short supply. This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going. The Royal Canadian Mint made a nod to this in 2018 by releasing a special-edition coin set fashioned in the likeness of 17th-century playing cards.Fly WestJet to discover (and enjoy!) the weird and the wonderful things in Canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00acda3e2b9cfe958f5c32949fa306157f0e5dae/0_1438_2681_1607/master/2681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b31d2f626b9e67eae287a93f0cc651ee","title":"wow factors 10 unmissable experiences in and around canadas greatest cities","story":"Get your fill of adrenalin-rush activities across Canada, with cave exploration, axe throwing and rodeos all in the mixCanada’s 10 provinces and three territories cover nearly 10m square kilometers and extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, to the Arctic Ocean – meaning there’s a whole lot of country to explore.

In 2013, Asperger’s was folded into the wider diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.Tony Attwood, a world authority on Asperger’s, has said people diagnosed are “usually renowned for being direct, speaking their mind and being honest and determined and having a strong sense of social justice”.Boys are more widely diagnosed than girls.Thunberg was diagnosed four years ago. She has acknowledged that her passion for her climate crisis work was partly down to viewing the world in stark terms.In July, Thunberg hit back at the Australian News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt for writing a deeply offensive column that mocked her diagnosis.He criticised her two-week trip across the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht because, he said “she refuses to fly and heat the planet with an aeroplane’s global warming gasses”.Bolt repeatedly referred to Greta’s mental health, saying she was “deeply disturbed”.Thunberg responded by tweeting that she was “deeply disturbed” by the “hate and conspiracy campaigns” run by climate deniers like Bolt.On Friday Thunberg was joined by crowds of American teenagers at a protest outside the UN headquarters in New York following her transatlantic crossing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b57b9bed4b4796a894c829ab848e18d0f335e8/943_866_4421_2652/master/4421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5033c24b0b7da1eab61a41d263c205bc","title":"river thames home to 138 baby seals latest count finds","story":"It has been a highway, a sewer and was declared biologically dead in the 1950s but the River Thames is now a nursery for 138 baby seals, according to the first comprehensive count of pups.Scientists from ZSL analysed photographs taken from a specially-chartered light aircraft to identify and count harbour seal pups, which rest on sandbanks and creeks around the Thames estuary, downstream from London, during the summer, shortly after they are born.“We were thrilled to count 138 pups born in a single season,” said conservation biologist Thea Cox. “The seals would not be able to pup here at all without a reliable food source, so this demonstrates that the Thames ecosystem is thriving and shows just how far we have come since the river was declared biologically dead in the 1950s.”The Thames is home to both grey seals and harbour seals, although only the latter breed there. The seals can feed on more than 120 species of fish in the river, including two species of shark, short-snouted seahorses and the European eel, which is critically endangered. Marine mammals spotted in the Thames include porpoises, dolphins and “Benny” the beluga whale.The river’s seal population has risen steadily since ZSL began its annual count in 2013. The most recent results, from 2017, recorded 1,104 harbour seals and 2,406 grey seals across the estuary.It is not yet known if the numbers were due to resident seals having pups or adults moving in from other areas, such as eastern Scotland, where seal populations have been falling.Anna Cucknell, who leads ZSL’s Thames conservation project, said: “The restored ‘Mother Thames’ – as we call her – is an essential nursery habitat. Harbour seal pups can swim within hours of birth which means they are well adapted to grow up in tidal estuaries, like the Thames. By the time the tide comes in they can swim away on it. Grey seals, on the other hand, take longer to be comfortable in the water, so breed elsewhere and come to the Thames later to feed.”While the harbour seals breed in the outer estuary, a swath of low-lying coastline between Felixstowe to the north and Goodwin Sands, off Kent, to the south, they forage right through London to Richmond, and can move beyond weirs in pursuit of food.Cucknell added: “The Thames is home to more than 20 fish species that use the Thames as a nursery habitat. Marine species such as sea bass and flounder use it right in the city – past the Houses of Parliament and up to Putney, before they head out to sea. Having a robust and healthy food web plays a huge part in supporting top predators such as seals.”According to Cucknell, pollution including sewage is “still a challenge” in the Thames. Poor plumbing in some housing developments still results in untreated sewage flowing into the Thames. ZSL is running a citizen science project called Outfall Safaris, in which volunteers walk along often-hidden tributaries and help trace the source of this sewage pollution.The latest seal pup survey is from 2018. Scientists are still analysing thousands of photographs from the 2019 count. ZSL is also asking people to help count and monitor the Thames seal population by logging on to its camera traps surveying different Thames-side “haul-out” sites, and recording what seal species they see there.Cucknell added: “For a long time, we had our back to the water and we haven’t seen it as habitat, it’s just been a waterway. We’re trying to change people’s perceptions. We call it London’s biggest wildlife secret. They see the brown water and think it is dirty and dead. We hope people will take inspiration from it, and ownership of it.”The name of the longest river flowing entirely in England may derive from “tamasa”, a Sanskrit word meaning “dark water”.The Thames has always been brown, and will remain so even if one day it is entirely free of pollution.The brown waters are caused by eight-metre tides that scour its muddy estuary. They are the source of much of its bioersity: allowing plankton to survive which feed off nutrients in the water column and provide food for fish.Sixty years ago, however, the Thames was toxic. “The tidal reaches of the Thames constitute a badly managed open sewer,” the  reported in 1959. “No oxygen is to be found in it for several miles above and below London Bridge.”In 1957 the Natural History Museum declared the Thames to be biologically dead. The Victorian engineer Joseph Bazalgette’s brilliant sewer system, which saved London from the “great stink” of 1858, had been damaged during the second world war. Parts had fallen into disrepair. Heavy industry used the Thames as its free waste disposal service.Not everyone was outraged.  reported in 1959 that a member of the House of Lords opined that cleaning the river was unnecessary: rivers were “natural channels for the disposal of waste” and allowing them to break up our waste gave them “something to do”.Repairs to the sewers and tighter regulations, including to reduce fertilisers and pesticides from farmland draining into rivers, gradually cleaned up the Thames, as did broader economic changes. The decline of Thames-side industry removed pollution toxic metals have reduced since 2000, helped by the switch to digital photography, which has reduced the photographic industry’s silver pollution.A time-traveller from the 1950s visiting the hides at the London Wetland Centre (created from disused reservoirs in Barnes) would scarcely believe the great white egrets, kingfishers, hobbies and dragonflies that are testimony to a new, enriched urban ecosystem.The Thames is more wildlife-friendly than it was, but it is not perfect. Salmon were reintroduced to the Thames, but this scheme seems to have failed. The inner Thames is too busy and noisy with boats for dolphins or porpoises to thrive (seals do not hunt using sound and so are more able to survive alongside water traffic).A species as rare as a tiger still snakes through the capital – the endangered European eel – but it is in drastic decline. Like London’s citizens, the future prospects for this and many Thames species depend on the world beyond it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

Indeed, she’s recently returned from a holiday in Majorca during which she hopped over to Ibiza and was snapped clubbing with her news colleague, Simon McCoy. One might even say she looks pretty perky.She was referring to that moment in a battle when you have to convince your opponent that you are willing to do what it takes to achieve your goal that you will not blink, or back down, or slink away. And on 4 June 2018, when her grievance appeal was turned down with no further option but litigation, Gracie didn’t blink she threatened war. When the BBC responded by sending a senior executive to her house to negotiate, she hid the washing up and the dog’s toys, shooed her teenage son upstairs and turned her garden sprinkler on to hide the unmown grass. “Imagine the home of a single parent locked in a long battle with her employer and suffering depression as a result,” she writes. “That’s what my house looked like.” It didn’t matter. The BBC had agreed to pay parity, and to backdate the consequent increase. She had won.Victory, though, is rarely the final moment. Particularly when you have a powerful collective – known as BBC Women – to fight injustice alongside you, and when your objective is not to destroy an organisation, but to make it confront inequality and reform. And particularly when you were shocked to find yourself in a fight at all.“I just thought we’d sort it out,” Gracie tells me of the period in July 2017 when, after the BBC was compelled by Royal Charter to publish details of salaries over £150,000, she discovered that she was being paid substantially less as China editor than the corporation’s US editor, Jon Sopel, or its man in the Middle East, Jeremy Bowen. “We’d have a conversation, we’d sort it out – because I’d asked for equal pay before I went to China, for one thing, and I was just like, ‘Well what on earth’s happened here? This is all a bit weird.’ So in the beginning, I guess I thought it was the anomaly that they kept claiming it was.” The words “oversight” and “anomaly”, she drily notes, are much beloved by those who pay women less than they’re entitled to and then get found out.As it turned out, there seemed to be no intention of “sorting it out” rather, Gracie embarked on a protracted series of confrontations in which her sense of self-esteem and her faith in professionalism and ethical behaviour were shaken. Throughout, she was sustained by the solidarity of female colleagues, although she remains adamant that this is a universal problem: “Whenever anyone makes it a woman’s issue, it annoys me. It’s a human issue. And do they believe in equality? Do they believe in justice?”Gracie had not been dissatisfied with her annual pay of £134,000 and she is well aware of her own privilege as an Oxford graduate, a longtime journalist and a white, middle-class woman. (Nor was she shy of talking about pay back in 2009, at the height of the MPs’ expenses scandal, she had responded to a demand from Lord Foulkes, irritated at being questioned by her, to reveal her salary: £92,000, she replied, immediately and unapologetically. In the hoopla after the programme, it was reported that McCoy, her co-host, was earning £190,000, although the BBC denied it.) But now she was angry that the post she had been all but begged by James Harding, then director of news, to take three-and-a-half years earlier was being remunerated at up to half the rate – high salaries were published in bands – than those performing a clearly comparable role. Harding had invoked her experience and expertise – now 57, she had joined the World Service in 1987, covered the death of Deng Xiaoping, the handover of Hong Kong and the Beijing Olympics, and speaks fluent Mandarin – and the urgency of covering China’s rise as a superpower to persuade her she would not simply be good in the role, she was arguably the only person who could do it to the required standard.Gracie’s hesitation was not due to a lack of interest, but a consideration of the impact of a long-distance, high-profile job on her teenage children, one of whom had endured childhood leukaemia and both of whom had watched their mother survive breast cancer. There were also the challenges of reporting from a heavily censored, one-party state. But when she accepted the role, urged by friends and family, she demanded equal pay, having long suspected that she was paid less than male colleagues. Until July 2017, she believed she had secured it.She is at pains to point out that it wasn’t about the money and, indeed, when she reached a financial settlement with the BBC, she donated the full amount of £361,000 to the Equal Pay Advice Service and the Fawcett Society.“If I’d been more motivated by money than I was by advancing gender equality,” she explains now, “then I might have pursued a different course. But I wasn’t, because I am very deeply – what would be the verb? – immersed in BBC values.”Among those values, one might conclude, are fairness, impartiality and a respect for facts. But Gracie’s attempts to correct the “oversight” suggest otherwise. “I definitely think it’s easy to make the mistake of pointing out a problem and think that by articulating the problem clearly and forcefully you are thereby solving the problem,” she says. “I learned the hard way that that’s not how it works you know, reasoning with people who are powerful, wealthy, have status, reason with them and you can make the best argument in the world. It can be evidence-based until the cows don’t come home and you’re still not going to win.”One of the reasons is that pay, as well as being an emotive and often obscured part of our lives, is also, as Gracie points out, like the game Jenga – once you start to mess with one brick, the whole edifice starts to wobble. That’s why, she argues, employers in cases like these attempt to “keep it isolated in one woman’s silo and then preferably she will sign some kind of confidentiality clause about it, about the back pay or whatever they’re going to give her to make it right, then often it does stay quiet and it gets resolved”.Less chance of that, of course, when the organisation is a highly scrutinised and publicly funded national institution one in which the subjects themselves are adept at gathering and disseminating news. At the beginning of 2018, getting nowhere with the BBC, after having taken advice from such BBC luminaries as Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Mishal Husain, Gracie threw a gigantic stone into the millpond by using the letters page of the Times to reveal the details of her case on the front page, the newspaper reported that more than 130 other women working at the BBC had endorsed her case. That same morning, Gracie headed into Broadcasting House to present the Today programme – in one of the situation’s many grim ironies, she had been given some holiday cover in response to widespread complaints that the programme didn’t have enough female presenters. Her co-presenter was John Humphrys who, she writes in Equal, arrived at 4am, told her that her letter was either idiocy or a stroke of genius, and “then did some harrumphing that it would be uncollegiate of me to repeat”.During our conversation, I press her to do precisely that – in particular concerning the far-from-supportive conversation that Humphrys was recorded having with Jon Sopel, both of them presuming themselves to be off air. (It is a matter of continuing amazement that veteran broadcasters seem to have such trouble remembering the cast-iron rule that you are never alone with a microphone.) What did she feel? What did the programme’s editor, Sarah Sands, delayed by travel arrangements that morning, say to her when they finally caught up?She is admirably, if frustratingly, guarded she replies that she has said everything she wants to say about her colleagues in Equal, and doesn’t want to speak off the cuff. (Even in the book she’s tactful, saying that she felt the pair had let her, the BBC and its audiences down.) Of Sands, she says now: “I mean private conversations are private conversations, so I said what I said. I actually think Sarah just laughed but I can’t remember, to be honest.” Where Gracie is prepared to be forthcoming is on the toll that such a gruelling and prolonged experience takes. She stopped sleeping properly and became depressed eventually, her doctor signed her off work. “I was mentally unwell,” she says now. “And that’s not uncommon. These fights take a huge amount out of people.”What was her primary sensation? “Helplessness. I don’t like feeling helpless. And when I feel helpless, I feel really helpless, it’s physically, emotionally immobilising. I have to lie down, you know? I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to operate.”This comes from a woman who has faced more than her fair share of harrowing loss and trauma. Her mother died of ovarian cancer at 42, when Gracie, the second of five children, was 17. It was, she agrees, an existential crisis.“I think my mother had provided my map of the world and without her it was hard to see why to get up in the morning or what you would do if you did get up in the morning. It was hard to have any sense of purpose about life at all.” It also gave her, she thinks, a sense of impatience, a conviction that waiting around for things to happen is a fool’s errand.That profound understanding that life is precarious and unpredictable can only have been reinforced by her daughter Rachel’s diagnosis with leukaemia when she was two years old. Gracie’s marriage, to Chinese musician Cheng Jin, foundered under the strain, and although he has stepped into the breach at various points, Gracie has for long periods been their children’s principal carer. She inherited the BRCA1 gene from her mother, which put her at risk of both breast and ovarian cancer in her 40s, she had breast cancer twice and went through chemotherapy and mastectomies.Gracie’s mother died, she says, because despite their best efforts, the medical profession had not found a way to cure her she and her daughter survived because they had. In her battle with her employer, she says she felt they were “finding clever ways to avoid solving the problems… that’s not acceptable to me. Life is short. We’re not going to do this.”Equal comes out at the beginning of this month, just a few months short of half a century after the 1970 Equal Pay Act. Carrie Gracie has returned to the BBC News Channel, where she worked before her appointment as China editor. BBC Women still exists Gracie describes them as “a large group of people who still believe in the things we believed in two years ago. We still fight a cause.”I ask her what she does when she’s not at work, writing a book and campaigning for equal pay. Uncustomary holidays in the Balearics aside, where’s the froth in her life? She hesitates before offering that she walks her dog and reads.“Yeah,” she says, ruefully. “Exciting life. What do I do? I don’t do anything that’s very frothy at the moment. I actually think my life needs more froth. Everyone needs froth and I think one of the downsides of writing a book about something as big and serious as this is that the froth has been marginalised in my life to an unacceptable degree.”I wonder if I’ve struck a chord, because, a little later, she says: “I might just kind of have more fun. I don’t have any debts to anyone else any more. I have a debt to myself.”Three-and-a-half years earlier James Harding, the then director of news, had begged me to become the BBC’s first China editor, saying we urgently needed to tell the story of a rising superpower and I was the only person who could do the story justice. The BBC had said the role was “on a par with” the other international editors. I’d explicitly made equal pay with my male peers a condition of taking the job. Four years on, my salary was £134,000 but this pay list said the North America editor was earning between £200,000 and £250,000.Equal pay might sound like an unusual deal-breaker, but it made perfect sense to me. Like many women at the BBC, I had long suspected I was earning less than the men I worked alongside. But in an environment where pay was opaque and talking about it taboo, it seemed preferable to talk about the journalism.I’d never asked my peers directly what they were earning and never issued an ultimatum on pay. I liked my male colleagues. It seemed invidious to challenge managers in a way that might impact the pay of people I liked.When I went through treatment for breast cancer, my bosses were kind to me. I reasoned that, in many ways, the BBC was a good employer. In return, I had always tried to be a good employee. Every year I persuaded my ex-husband Jin to come back from Beijing and stand in at home for a few weeks so that I could do one big reporting trip to China, and I never demanded higher pay for all the prep and post-production. The BBC showed me goodwill and I showed it goodwill back. One of my documentary projects followed the transformation of China through the experiences of three families in a village that was being razed to make way for a city. This White Horse Village series won the BBC a Peabody Award and an Emmy. At the moment the Emmy was announced in New York, I was, quite literally, washing up at my kitchen sink.My children, Rachel and Daniel, were 12 and 10 at the time, and as I dried my hands and sat down to help with homework I joked that I was a real-life Cinderella. But not being invited to the ball was a commonplace at the BBC. We had lots of people who did brilliant work for little recognition.In a letter to the director-general, Tony Hall, I wrote that unless I was made equal I would resign: “I am a cancer survivor in my mid-50s who lost my own mother to cancer when I was a teenager and who nursed my own daughter through childhood leukaemia. I did not apply for the China editor post, and was reluctant to take it, precisely because of the strains I knew it would impose on my family and my health. I agreed to do the job because I cared about our coverage of China and because I thought the BBC needed older women journalists to ‘lean in’. I am bitterly disappointed to discover that my contribution as an editor is valued at so much less than my male peers.’ I warned the director-general that unless I was made equal I would resign.I then worked backwards through the past 20 years of my career, asking male peers direct questions about pay. I chose not to tackle this face to face or on the phone, but to put questions in writing instead, as I felt this would allow me to be polite and clear and would allow them time to consider. My email explained that I realised they were under no obligation to disclose their salaries and might prefer not to, but that the recent revelations compelled me to ask in an attempt to make sense of my own pay story.The responses were mixed. Some men, like the Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen and the world affairs editor John Simpson, were generous with information. Others were less so. Asking became easier the more often I did it, and in the end I wished I had started years ago as it came to feel natural and collegiate, just something that all grown-ups should do. I felt grateful to those who shared. Theirs was a real-world demonstration of empathy, one of the simplest but most powerful things a man can do to help a woman achieve equal pay.Equal, by Carrie Gracie, is published by Little, Brown on 5 September (£18.99).

It can help to write these reasons down somewhere you can access them easily, to remind yourself when you feel your resolve wavering.”Once you’ve established your reasoning, Warrington says that you should continue to attend social functions, seeing them as “sober firsts”. “Weddings can be extra challenging, as these are some of our booziest get-togethers,” she says. “Go into these and any other ‘sober firsts’ with an open mind, and stay curious about what the experience will be like sober. If you’re used to drinking, staying sober can even be a different kind of altered state – with all the surprises, the highs and the lows.”With the alcohol-free market expanding, and some estimates anticipating it to grow by a third in the next three years, there are plenty of options available to replace your usual tipple of choice at a social function. Warrington recommends a tonic with bitters as being “more grown up than ordering a Coke”, while a record £57m was spent on non-alcoholic beers in Britain over the past year.Kate Bee, the founder of Sober School – a sobriety training course for women – emphasises the need to be confident about your decision. “Really own it and never apologise for not drinking,” she says. “Instead, smile brightly and say: ‘I’m not drinking at the moment and I can’t believe how much I’m enjoying it.’ Even if you have to fake that enthusiasm it’s worth it. It’s much harder for people to pressure you to drink if you’re happy being alcohol-free.”When undergoing such a potentially life-altering change, it is important to discuss what you are doing with friends and gain their support, according to Warrington. “Let your friends know about your journey as that can be one of the most powerful means of encouragement,” she says. “And when they see you’re capable of it, they might decide to try it for themselves, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccfb6492a79549e55bb6140c8541548db0bdfd77/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d2a53cf6f8e3bb4e741f68abefcdad","title":"10 downing street gets new resident a jack russell cross puppy","story":"Johnson and Symonds adopt Jack Russell cross abandoned by puppy farmerA momentary distraction from what is likely to be a hugely turbulent week in politics has arrived at Downing Street, in the form of a 15-week-old puppy.The Jack Russell cross, which has been named Dilyn, was chauffeured into the prime minister’s residence in a different kind of red box on Monday morning.The dog has been adopted by Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, from Friends of Animals Wales in Rhondda it was abandoned by a puppy farmer because of its undershot and misaligned jaw.The TV vet Marc Abraham, who has worked with the charity’s founder, Eileen Jones, said he made the couple aware of the shelter.“It was important to shine a light on the work she’s doing,” he told the BBC. “It’s entirely voluntary with huge vets’ bills so they only rescue and rehabilitate the ones with the most problems.”The arrival of the dog may come as a shock to 12-year-old Larry, the No 10 cat which has served three prime ministers.However, according to Abraham, the puppy has been living in a foster home with a cat, is house-trained and “is doing the basic commands already”.Under “Lucy’s law”, which is aimed at cracking down on puppy farms in England, the sale of kittens and puppies from third parties will be banned from next spring.

They live with their son in Aichi Prefecture, central JapanWhen Takahiro first spotted Emily at a birthday party in 2009, she was carrying a distinctive pink camera. “I’d never seen one before, so I went up and asked her about it. I was looking for an opportunity to speak to her,” he says. But when he told her his name, her reaction wasn’t quite what he expected. “I was shocked because he had the same name as my previous boyfriend, who was killed in a car crash a few months earlier,” Emily says. Though she had only dated him for a short period, she was devastated by his death. “He was very young and it was all over the news, so it had been quite a hard time for me.” Though she didn’t believe in fate, she says the chances of meeting two people with the same name “felt spooky”.At the party they chatted about their interest in photography, before she invited him to see her band play the following night. It wasn’t until a week later that she told Takahiro about her previous boyfriend. “I suddenly understood why her expression went a bit funny,” he explains. “It all made sense.”Emily, who is originally from Tasmania, had been living in Japan for three years and was working as a teacher when they met. “After he came to my gig, we had our first date in Starbucks and some of my students came in. They were asking if he was my boyfriend, which was embarrassing,” she laughs.Within a week, though, Takahiro had asked Emily to meet his family. “I thought it was fast,” she says, “but it felt so normal and natural to be together. It was the first time I’d felt that with another person.”A few months later, Takahiro had the chance to be interviewed for a job in Jamaica, but didn’t take up the offer. “I knew it would mean leaving the country for a couple of years. I turned it down at the very last minute. Maybe it was my subconscious telling me to stay.”Over the next two years, the couple explored Japan, taking their cameras with them everywhere they went. They also shared a passion for food, and enjoyed trying out ramen restaurants and whisky bars in new places.“We would travel to see my family regularly and I also had the chance to visit Tasmania in 2010, which was beautiful,” says Takahiro.A year later, they got married in Sapporo in northern Japan, where they lived at the time. “It’s not an easy place to get to, so it was a small wedding. We celebrated with 20 of our closest family and friends who came from Tasmania and Japan,” says Emily. “Then we went on honeymoon to Hawaii, which is a really popular destination for Japanese couples.”She adds that she didn’t have to change her name like most Japanese spouses must do by law. As she was a foreigner, it wasn’t compulsory for the couple to have the same surname. The couple speak English and Japanese. “I do get homesick sometimes,” Emily says. “It’s nice that he understands my language and perspective.” She says he is easygoing and a great sounding board when she is feeling stressed he loves how open-minded and accepting she is. “She’s also a brilliant cook. When I first met her, she wasn’t good but I never told her. She’s amazing now though.”The couple are now living happily in the area of Japan where they first met, with their four-year-old son. However, Emily admits she misses her home, and their long-term plan is to move to Australia. “Just before we met I had been planning to go back to Tasmania, but now I’ve been here 13 years because it just felt right,” says Emily. “I’d never believed in finding ‘the one’ or anything like that. But when he told me his name I had this internal freakout. It’s been 10 years since we met but I’ve never met another Takahiro since.”Want to share your story?

Normani breezes through the verses as if skipping down a crystalline staircase, just as Grande usually does. But Normani also has inimitable charisma, evincing her supreme confidence that she’s absolutely the only one who can please her man by taking a light touch to the delivery no sledgehammer required. It’s brassy and excellently sloganeering – “let me be your motivation … let me be your inspiration” – and has a proper dancing-in-the-rain, flirting-on-the-basketball-court smash of a video to match. LSAustralian pop-star-in-waiting Cxloe has written the anthem for an era in which fans express their love by asking their favourite stars to step their necks or run them over with a truck. Sick isn’t about pining politely: “I need you to make me sick  Love me out my mind,” she pleads, channelling some of Lorde’s dangerous intimacy, all tapered, gasping vocal delivery writhing through producer Gnash’s beats. Probably not what the doctor ordered, but when life is tempered through screens and a generation of young rappers and pop stars ooze numbed pain, her demand for a visceral, mind-overhauling kind of obsession sounds quite appealing. LSLike bonfires and birthday candles, Kim Gordon’s voice has a particular char that has become more distinctive with age. Now 66, she is releasing her first solo album, No Home Record, and the lead single places her signature ashy tone front and centre. She declaims menacingly and obliquely – “aliveness is an objection, affected me” – as a bass clarinet shudders like the surface of dark water, and percussive blasts detonate at random. It’s an unnerving landscape that becomes strangely moving when a pocket of reflection opens up, Gordon musing about a day “in the sunlight, dreaming in a tent”. The sound of forlorn acoustic guitar appears, seeming to mock her bucolic reverie. LSTuareg rockers Tinariwen have always made music that reflects the desert setting of its creation: loose, sparsely populated and full of stark contrasts. For their ninth album, the group rehearsed in the Moroccan Sahara en route to recording in Mauritania. You can almost hear a sand-laden breeze waft through the background on Kel Tinawen as singer Ibrahim Ag Alhabib employs his gravelly baritone as a counterpoint to indie star Cass McCombs’s gly guitars, a chorus of backing vocals keeping the mid-tempo groove undulating. It is imaginative music, a song to place the listener squarely within Tinariwen’s universe, regardless of where you are listening. AKNot a tribute to Definitely Maybe on its 25th anniversary – though admirably brazen in title – Slide Away is Miley Cyrus’s eulogy for her marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth. And it’s beautiful. Her dramatic vocal turn in the verses traces the scale of what they had – paradise, paralysing – only to shrink again, conveying the sense of necessary retreat in her lovely, limpid chorus: “So won’t you slide away?  Back to the ocean, I’ll go back to the city lights.” Like Ariana Grande’s Thank U, Next, it’s a dignified, adult breakup song – not score-settling, but honouring what was before moving on. LSPelada are Montreal electronic duo Chris Vargas and Tobias Rochman. Set to release their debut album on Pan this autumn, they came up through the city’s rave scene (the one that birthed Grimes a decade ago), distinguishing themselves by pairing Rochman’s hardware-focused production with unusual live vocals by Vargas, who rails in Spanish against power, surveillance and politics. While Vargas has cited the influence of their childhood exposure to cumbia on Pelada’s sound, Ajetreo (hustle and bustle) hews closer to the hectic, compressed kuduro sound that travelled from Angola to Lisbon’s electronic scene: Rochman gives the beat a junkyard patina that offers a playful contrast with his slippery pitch-shifting. LSSince winning the Mobo for best jazz act in 2015 with drummer Moses Boyd, saxophonist Binker Golding has become one of the key sidemen in the renascent London jazz scene, blowing coruscating sheets of free improvisation with Boyd, tasteful balladry with singer Zara McFarlane and challenging bebop with pianist Elliot Galvin. With his first quartet album as bandleader out in September, single ... And I Like Your Feathers is a subtly intricate number featuring a breezy interplay between Golding and bassist Daniel Casimir. It’s straight-ahead jazz but loses none of its potency for it Golding shows that his playing isn’t to be relegated to a dinner party background. AKA quick catch-up, for anyone not primed in the hot girl summer meme: Houston rapper Megan Thee Stallion has various aliases, including the Hot Girl. A few months back, a fan declared this a “hot girl summer”, and a meme was born, mostly revolving around Instagram posts of people showing off their hot bods. Obviously, brands from makeup companies to fast food chains leapt on it, almost killing it stone dead. But on the brink of summer’s burnout, Megan revived it with a titular anthem. It’s surprisingly laid back, but then, what is the essence of hot girl summer if not having nothing to prove? Getting Nicki Minaj (with her best verse in months) and Ty Dolla $ign (who arguably dominates too much) is bragging rights enough. Though Megan – her voice brilliantly thick with cynicism – packs in a few for good measure. “Got a whole lot of options ’cause you know a bitch poppin’.” LSLana Del Rey’s frame of reference is well established: Americana, essentially, as her new album’s brilliant title, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, makes plain. But now and then, another (probably accidental) reference rears up in her music: the ironclad, turn-of-the-millennium songwriting of Robbie Williams collaborator Guy Chambers. It’s there in the classic piano arrangement of The Greatest, a song about precisely the opposite of such triumphalism: the end of a relationship, the climate crisis, how “Kanye West is blond and gone”. If this is the end, at least Del Rey gives it a gorgeous coda. LSThe Highwomen are country supergroup Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires, Maren Morris and Natalie Hemby their mission closing the still staggering gender gap in country music. For their theme song, they involved Jimmy Webb in a rewrite of his 1975 hit that became the founding text for country supergroup the Highwaymen (comprising Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson) in 1985. But with a difference: the quartet don’t paint themselves as heroic outlaws, but revamp the original to reference the fates that befell women who dared to step outside society’s bounds. The group’s debut album will feature various guests: here, Bristol soul singer Yola and Sheryl Crow add to the quartet’s stirring vocal harmonies.

Without bland corporate sponsorship or dehumanising big screens flanking its main stages, it is defined by its oddball community, a circus of hedonists, eccentrics and beleaguered parents whose buggies clog paths as toddlers gawp at the peacocks. Hidden sculptures and carved tree trunks give the small site an otherworldly forcefield the stranger who held forth on avant-garde mixology around the campfire will unfailingly reappear one morning, perhaps during your recuperative stroll around the beekeeping enclosure. It is, for all its twee nooks and middle-class crannies, a winning mix of bacchanalia and earthy mysticism.Therein lies the EOTR magic, but nobody told Yves Tumor, who prowls the fogged-out Big Top on Friday in a silk stole and thigh-high boots. “I drove down way too many little-ass roads,” Tumor hisses theatrically, turning the sound monitors towards the crowd, “for this shit not to be loud enough.” A primal squall erupts – crashing R\u0026ampB blown out by industrial beats. After 45 captivating minutes – partly spent thrashing about in the front row – Tumor announces: “Whoever stole my scarf, you better hide that shit because I’m gonna kill you.” They swan off-stage, scooping up the hastily returned scarf along the way.The headliners hew more closely to the fest’s understated roots. Jason Pierce mostly performs from the side of the stage, as if Spiritualized’s rock hymns had drained his bones and left behind an empty vessel. Courtney Barnett honours her punk raconteur background, helming a grungy trio that electrifies her hyper-observant yarns. And nomy’s disco lights and falsetto singalongs illuminate a suitably verdant Woods stage.Those seeking grandiosity get their neo-soul fill from Michael Kiwanuka, but a detour to a Late Junction-curated stage ups the ante, with technomancer BodyVice and her gagged dancer pogoing around a giant prop of a human spine. Esoterica abounds: cellist Oliver Coates looks like a nervous Edwardian choirboy but, performing in front of a cloaked statue apparently representing death, his modern classical works marvels. Bridging the arty and incendiary is Mitski. She performs conceptual dance around a simple table while belting out anthems for twentysomethings that could start riots. From her poise emerges a latent fury: during Geyser she topples her desk prop, then freezes with longing and violently grapples with the table’s legs.Sunday corrals rising rockers Fontaines DC, surprise guests Shame and the doomier Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs Pigs, all young men of great intensity, though none has the flair of on-form Deerhunter, Bradford Cox vamping through cult classics from across the Atlanta band’s career. Squid’s playful abandon is a tonic to their brawnier contemporaries, while Serpentwithfeet’s wispy melisma and baroque R\u0026ampB exude a more spiritual intensity.Night descends and Jarvis Cocker, ever the picture of shaggy charisma, tumbles on stage in a stuffy blazer, waggling his arms like a bad magician or an excellent supply teacher. He sashays through anthems old and new, then warns of our return to reality. “But that’s tomorrow,” he says, introducing his 2009 album’s title track: “And we shouldn’t get bogged down in … Further Complications.”The portal between real life and the dreamland is Lonnie Holley, who conjures atomised jazz alongside a programmer who lays their synths on a Twister mat. The Alabama artist reprehends the tyranny of time, ego and America in a weathered growl, dreaming up poetry on topics such as the Amazon rainforest fire. “We’ll see you in the twilight zone, humans,” Holley concludes. Among End of the Road’s dreamy congregation, it’s as if we’ve already made it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e32538605def7ca8ee3d653b5fab8f052326b741/377_689_2979_1787/master/2979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2dc93a0edf8a3bab3f5ebe0c5dd32a7","title":"serge pizzorno interview kasabian solo album the slp","story":"He’s the lairy lad rocker who scored one of the best ever goals on TV – in winklepickers. Now he is aiming to be music’s answer to David LynchSerge Pizzorno is looking back at the rise of his band Kasabian and trying to pinpoint when it all became a bit too much.“You’d turn up at shows and there’d be 20-odd trucks there, a catering team, loads of people everywhere,” he says. “And you’d think, wow, this is actually a job for a lot of people, and it all rests on these four maniacs!”This was in 2017: the band had just completed their sixth album, For Crying Out Loud, released to mixed reviews, and all was not well in camp. After 20 years together, Pizzorno was worried the band were getting stuck in a rut. And then there was the personal turmoil: not for songwriter Pizzorno, who had settled into family life in Leicester (he has two boys, Ennio and Lucio), but for Tom Meighan, the band’s wild-eyed frontman.Mimicking their idols Noel and Liam Gallagher, Pizzorno wrote the songs while Meighan brought the stage presence, preposterous quotes (“Our songs sound like we’ve shit ourselves 10,000 feet in the air”) and ludicrous tales. Band legend had it that, whenever Meighan became too much to handle, the other members had to take him to the nearest Toys R Us store to calm him down. But following a split from his partner, the relentlessly upbeat singer was struggling. He cried in one interview at the time.“Tom’s still figuring things out, but he’s in a much better place now,” says Pizzorno when we meet for coffee in London. But it’s no wonder they needed time out. “I was worried we would get stale. Sometimes you need to go down the rabbit hole to refresh things.”The SLP is that rabbit hole. It’s his initials – his full name is Sergio Lorenzo Pizzorno – and the name of his forthcoming solo album, recorded at his home studio, the Sergery (yes, really). With its guest appearances from Little Simz and Slowthai, and wild eclecticism, it’s reminiscent of Gorillaz – a cartoonish world constructed as an escape from the pressures of being in an enormous band.Pizzorno sees it less as a new direction and more a return to the way he started off making music. Back then he was using an old Atari and a Midi keyboard these days he’s been recording on his phone, stealing snippets from 70s Italian horror movies, “weird Polish shit”, and whatever grabs his attention when he’s out and about.“I’ll be in Tokyo, hear the buzz of the electricity running through the pylons, and be like...” he waves his phone in the air, as if frantically trying to record the sound. “All my mates will be taking the piss. And even in my own head I’m thinking, ‘I’m never gonna use this.’ But this time I did.”Indeed, the buzzing pylons make it into The Wu, an incredibly odd song about wandering through hotel corridors in search of the afterparty. It’s a case study in Pizzorno’s esoteric influences, from the South African disco label Heads and Lee “Scratch” Perry to the late Nigerian synth wizard William Onyeabor. Elsewhere there’s Mediterranean house (Nobody Else), mariachi meltdowns (Meanwhile … in the Welcome Break) and, in ((trance)), the kind of joyously anthemic track that wouldn’t sound out of place in, well, a Kasabian set.Did the rest of the band not think: can’t we have a couple of these tunes? “It’s probably testament to why we’re still together that they didn’t mind,” says Pizzorno. “Tom understands that you need to explore what else is out there. Otherwise you become the band everyone expects you to be.”The irony is that Kasabian have never been the band a lot of people think they are anyway. When they emerged in the early 00s, with electro-influenced rock anthems such as Clubfoot and LSF, they were stereotyped as lairy lad rockers, when in reality they were just as enamoured by hip-hop and acid house.“On our first record I would wanna sit people down and go, ‘No, no, no – this is where we were fishing for that stuff, Can and Neu! or whoever. But whatever we said, the journalist would just ask us about the Happy Mondays. I soon realised it was best to just keep your mouth shut, because if you’re still able to make albums and art, who cares where it comes from anyway?”I interviewed the band a few times back then and always found them far kinder and more erudite than they were portrayed (“On the road carnage with rock’s rowdiest band!” screamed one NME cover line). But it’s fair to say, with their wild tales and boasts, they played up to it.Was the lad thing a bit of an act? “We knew that journalists wanted it,” says Pizzorno. “But at the same time, we did grow up where, if you wanted to be in a band, you had to have your wits about you. If you’re playing in a village pub in Leicester in front of a load of lads that would throw darts at your head for having long hair, you can either go in and be all art school, or you can snap a snooker cue in half and say, ‘Let’s go!’ But then I still wanted to get them in the corner and talk about Jodorowsky afterwards.”Pizzorno’s lad-rock credentials were no doubt enhanced by two televisual moments: a goal on Soccer AM, in which he improbably flicked the ball up in the air while wearing winklepickers before volleying it into a tiny hoop and an even better strike during the Soccer Aid charity match that saw him scoop the ball over former England keeper David Seaman’s head and into the top corner of the net. The mention of these acts of sporting glory makes Pizzorno groan: “You’ll work for ages on a piece of music or art that you’re really proud of. But kick a ball through a hole in an inflatable bouncy castle and it’s what you become known for.”Less impressive when it comes to lad stereotypes was a cover of Q magazine, on which Meighan and Pizzorno appeared alongside two naked ladies, something that even back in 2011 looked like a relic of a bygone era. Pizzorno groans again, but this time he means it. “That really kills me,” he says. “It was sold to us as Jimi Hendrix, Electric Ladyland, a celebration of 60s psychedelia. But we learned an important lesson there – we need to take control over every element.”There’s a song on The SLP that addresses this, the final track Meanwhile … in the Silent Nowhere. “It’s about communication,” says Pizzorno. “Previously, even if you were rightwing or had extreme views, it felt like there could be some sort of dialogue where you could at least hear each other’s stories. Now it feels like, ‘This is my belief, fuck you’ ... there’s a danger in us not sitting down and talking face to face.”Right now, Pizzorno has more pressing problems than the overthrow of capitalism: how to be a musician without Meighan by his side. He’s planned an impressive stage show, with different characters performing each song. It sounds ambitious. “But in a really minimal way,” he stresses. “Not overblown, the opposite to lasers and screens. It won’t be pretentious. Pretentious is my number one fear.”Will there be costume changes? “Very subtle ones. There might be a hat. I might be barefoot. Fundamentally, I want it to be like a David Lynch thing, where people feel on edge, as if they’ve entered another world for 50 minutes.”Pizzorno says he knows he can never compete with Kasabian’s enormous gigs – those gigantic, truck-bearing affairs with catering teams and staff everywhere. “But the aim is to get to that same euphoric point,” he says, “just in a whole new way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaf5d2aec2f80f1304a6f9e8a4a8e6ec158a76f0/0_1380_7300_4380/master/7300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c1940d8487468b10fe47b829d261a3a","title":"the man who gave birth podcast","story":"Freddy McConnell is a  journalist and trans man who in 2016 decided to begin the process of conceiving and delivering his own child.

It asks users a series of multiple choice questions and spells out the precautions that iniduals should take immediately to make sure they are prepared for the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal.British citizens resident in the UK who have become used to easily travelling across Europe are warned to ensure that their passport has at least six months to run and told they may once again have to pay roaming charges on their mobile phones.They are also recommended to allow extra time for border checks at ports and airports and told to make sure they have travel insurance as the European health insurance card – which covers the cost of state-provided healthcare in EU countries – will not be valid in the event of a no-deal exit.People taking their UK-registered vehicles abroad will have to carry additional paperwork proving their ownership of the vehicle and potentially obtain an international driving permit, while British drivers will face a fine if they do not stick a large GB sticker on their rear bumper, even if they already have the country listed on their numberplate.Pet passports, which have made it easy for people who regularly travel abroad to take their cat, dog or ferret overseas, could become invalid in the event of no deal, with owners warned it could take up to four months to get the appropriate paperwork and blood tests from vets.Although the Get Ready site largely collates existing government advice, the list of suggestions spells out in exacting detail the impact Brexit will have on people and businesses. EU citizens living in the UK are reminded to apply to the settlement scheme “as soon as possible” if they want to remain in the country, while European students are warned that their Erasmus+ placements at British universities may no longer be valid.The advice is not detailed and does not spell out the seriousness of the consequences for Britons settled in Europe in the event of no deal. Under EU law they will become third-country nationals and will not be able to offer services to another EU country automatically or to travel for work in another EU country.The campaign group British in Europe has frequently protested that the British government has forgotten about them. The new website merely advises that “you may not be able to continue living and using services in the EU if you are not a resident”, without spelling out the gravity of the end of free movement for Britons living in the EU.The more complicated warnings are saved for businesses, although the website does not offer a hierarchy of risks. British companies are warned that they may need to pay for extra legal advice, should consider whether they need to appoint agents and representatives based in Europe, and warned of the extra regulation required if they want to continue trading in the EU after Brexit.The site warns manufacturers that they may need to change their labelling, companies that handle the data of EU citizens are told they may no longer be able to access it in the same way, and almost all companies are warned starkly: “You may not be able to trade goods with the EU if you do not get your business ready.”Most of the recommended actions are listed with a warning to “do it as soon as possible”, but with fewer than 60 days to go until the planned Brexit day, small businesses checking the website for the first time may not have time to do all the required work.However, the site shows that not everyone is affected by Brexit. British nationals who live and work in the UK, do not run a business and have no plans to travel abroad are told to sit back and relax: “Based on your responses, you do not need to take any action to prepare for the Brexit deadline of 31 October 2019.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1af30fb040c3a85b3e894b332da4be6af3d26a1/862_421_5261_3157/master/5261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f6ee5d180aa5c1275440f8eb183f27c","title":"jeremy corbyn labour election northern vote no deal brexit","story":"Labour leader previews manifesto plans and says no deal would be gift to TrumpJeremy Corbyn has put his party on a general election footing while renewing his pledge to block a no-deal Brexit in parliament this week.In a wide-ranging speech that focused heavily on the party’s manifesto pledges and support for the north of England, the Labour leader said his priority was to legislate to stop no deal by teaming up with other parties.However, he raised speculation that he would back an election in any circumstances, even if Boris Johnson was to call one. In an off-camera remark to Sky News at the event in Salford, he said: “Of course, we are the opposition party, we want a general election.”Earlier, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said Labour was working with other parties to deliver legislation in parliament on Tuesday but also supported a general election. She said the shadow cabinet was working on a bigger manifesto than Labour’s 2017 platform. Corbyn said in his speech that a no-deal Brexit would be a gift for Donald Trump. “No-deal Brexit is really a Trump-deal Brexit, leading to a one-sided US trade deal that will put us at the mercy of Donald Trump and the big American corporations,” he said. “Unless we stop Johnson’s Tory government now it’s a headlong rush into the arms of Donald Trump.”He touched on the majority of the party’s policy areas iduring the 30-minute address and focused particularly on pledges for the north of England, in what could be seen as overtures to Labour supporters in leave-voting areas.Promises to invest in Crossrail in the north, which would link Liverpool and Hull, received a cheer from the audience, and he also pledged to rebalance the economy away from London, reverse council cuts and invest in manufacturing.Corbyn said Labour was prepared to work with other parties to stop no deal and would deliver details of the legislation on Tuesday morning. “We will do everything we can to stop a no-deal exit from the European Union. That is our priority,” he said.A vote of no confidence in Johnson also remained on the table, he said, although the focus this week had shifted to stopping no deal. “The vote of no confidence is very much there on the table. It’s not an either or. Both options are absolutely there,” he said.“And we will do everything we can in the coming weeks to prevent a no deal. We want a general election so the people of this country can decide their future and we are very clear that we would in the Labour manifesto include a public vote under a Labour government with the option of remain or whatever alternative parliament has come to.“If it’s no deal then we vote to remain. If it’s any other deal then our party’s democratic processes will decide what position we take.”After the speech, Corbyn was due to meet members of his shadow cabinet in Salford to take a final decision on what legal wording they would support in a cross-party motion on stopping no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb1d3308dbee42180fd841b3ffbc7b4aa952a420/0_10_698_419/master/698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9efc098f294a2317b1fd4c60b46a1d","title":"a typical hour in the life of the irish border","story":"The map above shows border crossings in real time over the busiest hour of an ordinary Monday, 26 August 2019. The currently invisible frontier is not an arcane footnote of the Brexit process but an everyday part of people\u0027s lives and livelihoodsThere are 72m road vehicle crossings a year between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra). There are also eight trains daily in either direction between Dublin and Belfast. A no-deal Brexit would effectively end this trade. UK government advice says that to transport animals, products of animal origin (POAO), fish, shellfish, crustaceans, germplasm or fishery products from the UK to the EU in the event of no deal, you’ll need to ensure the trade route for your goods allows for your consignment to be checked at a border inspection post (BIP) at the first EU country you enter for export.There are two BIPs in Ireland: one at Dublin port, and the other at Shannon airport in the middle of the island. This means that farmers in Fermanagh who wanted to sell livestock at the market in nearby Sligo would have to send their animals to Belfast, across the sea to Scotland, by road through England to Holyhead in Wales, back across the sea, to Dublin, and right across Ireland.The Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has always insisted its priority is for Northern Ireland not to be cut off from Great Britain, politically or economically. Northern Ireland\u0027s export trade with GB in 2017 was worth £11.3bn, nearly three times the £3.9bn it exported to Ireland.But it\u0027s worth considering who the losers would be in the event of a no-deal Brexit and the sudden return of border controls. They are not, typically, employees of large companies who work in Belfast and deal with the rest of the United Kingdom. They are, rather, people working for small businesses in counties Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone, especially those in the agricultural sector.It stands to reason that border areas will be worst affected, but even given that, the blow will fall hardest on western rather than southern border areas. With some exceptions, these are more Irish-nationalist areas overall, and least likely to vote for the DUP.• Main graphic source: Transport Infrastructure Ireland. The simulation shows total traffic reported by under-wheel sensors at 10 border crossings between 17:00 and 18:00 on 26 August 2019. This is a small fraction of the total crossing-points - there are more than 200 - and includes only sensors where most readings can be assumed to indicate a cross-border journey."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c0a8153f69841924128c45acaf2bef684b382e0/0_622_2773_1664/master/2773.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69bb5380c1533e187a62d3519837bee4","title":"scientists isolate drought resistant gene in barley","story":"Research led by Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, will help crops resist global heatingThe discovery of a gene in barley responsible for drought resistance will help future-proof crops against some of the effects of climate change, scientists believe.Researchers spent nearly five years isolating the specific gene – HvMYB1 – from more than 39,000 genes in barley. Tests proved that plants in which the gene is more prominently expressed are better able to survive drought.The scientists believes this finding will have important implications for the cereal industry as it faces increasing challenges from climate crisis-related drought.Peter Morris from Heriot-Watt University led the research team. “By increasing the expression of this particular gene in test plants and simulating drought conditions, we’ve been able to prove that plants in which HvMYB1 is more prominently expressed are able to survive prolonged periods of drought,” he said. “This is a significant finding that will allow more drought-resistant crops to be bred in the future.“Drought is already impacting yields, with the European cereal harvest hit particularly hard in 2018. A prolonged, dry and hot summer significantly impacted yields and quality. As climate change gathers pace and we experience more extreme seasons, it is essential we can maintain continuity of supply.” The findings were published in the journal Plant Physiology and Biochemistry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfd9ca9f3efe943f64221256dd84629c1f650dff/0_107_3816_2292/master/3816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41a9b19dfdcd5e3045431190be2185a0","title":"sportswashing saudi arabia sports mohammed bin salman","story":"Saudi Arabia’s relatively sudden interest in sports can be construed as a soft power tactic to help distract from the kingdom’s ongoing human rights abuses and the Yemen crisisLast month, the foreign registration documentation for Saudi Arabia’s 2018 lobbying campaign in the United States were made available online. The documents shed light on the kingdom’s aggressive sportswashing strategy that included meetings and business calls with the commissioners for Major League Soccer (MLS), the National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), as well as officials from World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and the Los Angeles Olympic Committee.Saudi Arabia’s strategic interest in sports and entertainment events dates back to November 2016 when crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the kingdom’s General Sports Authority – the government body responsible for the development of sports in the kingdom – to set up a Sports Development Fund that bolstered sports activity in the country. The objectives of the fund were to privatize football clubs to increase participation, promote new sports events, and add 40,000 jobs to the economic marketplace as part of Vision 2030, a development proposal that laid out a modern, technocratic future for Saudi Arabia in which the country would be free of its heavy dependence on oil.Given that Saudi Arabia has historically opposed Western-influenced sports and entertainment events, these recent developments seemed to represent a significant change in the ultra-conservative Islamic nation’s policies and a pivot away from the kingdom’s longstanding societal limitations.Since Bin Salman’s policy shift was imposed in 2016, the kingdom has hosted the Race of Champions (ROC) motorsport event, secured a long-term deal with the WWE that includes multiple shows a year, hosted boxing events headlined by stars like Amir Khan, hosted a PGA European Tour golf event, and even secured the rights to host the December rematch between former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz Jr, arguably the biggest boxing pay-per-view of the year.While Saudi Arabia’s pivot towards a more liberal society is a welcome change for the conservative kingdom, it also raises important questions about the government’s relatively sudden interest in sports and whether it could be construed as a soft power tactic to help distract from the kingdom’s ongoing human rights abuses and the Saudi-led coalition against Yemen – a war that killed thousands of Yemeni civilians and has left 14m people at risk of starvation.More recently, Saudi Arabia’s sports-centric lobbying offensive has been the result of an urgent need for the kingdom to rebrand itself following the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Washington Post columnist and Saudi dissident who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where he was reportedly killed and dismembered with a bone-saw. Saudi’s attorney general later stated that the murder was premeditated, and the CIA concluded that Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s murder.In light of Saudi’s recent diplomatic controversy, the kingdom has doubled down on its lobbying strategy, which, according to recently released documents, included meetings and business calls with all the leading commissioners and sports bodies in the United States.Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority enlisted the services of the Churchill Ripley Group, an international consulting firm “specializing in growth” that boasts “unique access to Hollywood, Silicon Valley and the Middle East”. The LA-based firm represents the General Sports Authority by working with Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, the daughter of former US ambassador Prince Bandar and the first female president of the Saudi Federation for Community Sports, to help set up meetings in the US with various companies and executives to discuss the development of Saudi’s burgeoning entertainment sector. The Group’s roles and responsibilities, according to the foreign registration documents, also involve negotiating favourable market terms for “GSA funded initiatives,” finding direct investment opportunities, and preparing Princess Reema for her high level meetings. By placing Princess Reema at the helm of this lobbying and media campaign, the Saudi government is attempting to disarm critics who bemoaned the monarchy’s lack of progressive values or limited rights for women.The firm’s services, which are done without a formal contract, cost the Saudi government $22,000 a month.According to the foreign registration documentation (filled out by Anna Lewis, the founder and former CEO of the Churchill Ripley firm), Princess Reema had conversations with the likes of Kobe Bryant regarding the “development of basketball in Saudi Arabia” Sophie Goldschmidt, the CEO of World Surf League, regarding the “development of the sport of surfing in Saudi Arabia” the CEO of Thinkwell regarding the “development of a sports mall in Saudi Arabia” Bing and Twitch about advancing esports in the kingdom the NHL commissioner on developing floor hockey in Saudi Madison Square Garden regarding the development of “stadium infrastructure” and many more.The documents also revealed that Saudi Arabia’s General Sports Authority held several press events in 2018, including a public event with the Atlantic Council, the Middle East Policy Council, and another event hosted by the Saudi government for Saudi US CEO forum. Princess Reema was also interviewed by MSNBC, Reuters, NPR, ESPN, and the Washington Post as part of her media campaign to promote sports development in Saudi Arabia. She was also interviewed by CNN about women driving in Saudi Arabia.It should be noted that the documentation used for this reporting only lists the Churchill Ripley’s strategic consulting proposal, as well as the business calls and meetings that took place between Princess Reema and the various sports entities. They did not include any follow-up information on the fallout of such meetings, or whether they were even successful.And yet, the documents shed light on the Saudi government’s extensive sports lobbying strategy. These examples of sportswashing – a term coined by Amnesty International in 2018 to describe authoritarian regimes using sports to manipulate their international image and wash away their human rights record – highlight the lengths the Saudi monarchy is willing to go to in order to rebrand themselves in the wake of recent atrocities. It also emphasizes the scope of Saudi’s ambitions, which include potentially building new stadiums, and investing in esports and less mainstream sports such as field hockey and surfing.As of the time of writing, none of the MLS, WSL, Madison Square Garden, or the Bryant Stibel investment group have responded to a request for comment from the . An NBA spokesperson said: “NBA representatives regularly meet with basketball federations from around the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b28d1b73d0a3dddd219406363c542898fc34aff3/0_72_2852_1712/master/2852.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93e34a73cc106196d9b6d184ab502ab3","title":"us open 2019 naomi osaka bencic zverev monfils day eight live","story":"Vekic, now looking the stronger player, holds to 15 for 4-4 and you wouldn’t bet against her going on to win this set now.Vekic again holds comfortably and finds a nice pass on Goerges’ serve for 15-15.

Vekic needs to step things up considerably on her opponent’s serve here.Rich writes in: “He was obviously injured from the match before last but consistently refused to answer media questions about it, in fact saying more than once that he was good and ready to play. We fans base our decisions to invest a lot of time and money on these statements. Also the sports culture here in the US demands more transparency about injuries. So yes, boo to Novak (as great as he is) for intentionally misleading us.”I do take this point but it just seems a bit habitual from that particular crowd.Much, much better from Vekic here. She finds a few sweet groundstrokes to hold for love and get off the mark. She’s still a break down though at 3-1.It’s wet in New York – good job the roof is on here!Goerges is serving superbly and holds for 3-0, via a failed challenge from Vekic who thought an ace should have been called out.Well, well – Goerges breaks Vekic at the first time of asking, doing so to love. She has started very assertively indeed and leads 2-0.And we get underway! Goerges serves first and moves 30-0 up with a sweet double-handed backhand winner. But Vekic is hitting the ball well too and pulls to 30-30, before Goerges serves it out to go 1-0 up.Vekic and Goerges are out on court at Louis Armstrong. Neither player has ever gone beyond this stage at a US Open before, and Vekic hasn’t reached a grand slam last-eight at all. What gives this time?Where Bencic and Osaka are concerned, we’re reminded that Bencic leads the head-to-head 2-1. That starts in about an hour and I think there is every chance it might go all the way ...We won’t see Johanna Konta today – but if she has her way we’ll get several more chances over the rest of the week!Vekic is yet to drop a set at this US Open Goerges has dropped one, in her opening-round win over Natalia Viklyantseva. It should be a very close match given that, in terms both of ranking and seeding, you can barely separate them.Play in the Vekic-Goerges match starts in around about 40 minutes. You can send in your emails and tweets to the addresses above if you’d like to provide your observations, on that tie or any other aspect of the US Open so far!That does exactly what it says on the tin! I wonder if we’ll see the kind of drama we got yesterday, when Novak Djokovic was booed off at Arthur Ashe after retiring hurt against Stan Wawrinka. They like an entirely unreasonable boo there, don’t they? But anyway, lots of positives in store today: we’ll see how Naomi Osaka and Gael Monfils do in their fourth round clashes, for one thing. Arguably the biggest match of the day comes much later on, when Rafael Nadal faces Marin Cilic. I’ll be tucked up in bed by then and you might, too!

We are exhausted by the prospect of signing up to yet another subscription service. We are exhausted by the punishing promises of franchises being run even further into the dirt in the form of sequels, spinoffs and series. We are exhausted and baffled and defeated by the trailer for The World According to Jeff Goldblum.However, as much as it resembles the smiling face of cultural monopoly, Disney+ does have one thing going for it. According to reports from Disney’s D23 conference, it will release new episodes of its shows weekly. The Madalorian will play out across eight weeks. The Loki series will run over six. In an age when consumers are used to being given everything they want at once, Disney+ is bringing back the lost art of patience – and it can’t come soon enough.The Netflix model of bulk-releasing seasons was a fun novelty at first, but there are signs that people are growing tired of it – especially people who like talking about television. The amount of eggshell-walking it has created – with people tiptoeing around juicy plotlines for fear of spoiling things for their busier friends – has become absurd. The recap ecosystem has suffered, too. How do you cover a show that arrives in one piece? Do you burn through several episodes a day with little time for decent reflection, as the AV Club did recently with Glow? Or do you take your time and give proper attention to one episode a week, even though the show will be a distant memory for most viewers once you have crawled to the finale? It is a minefield.Similarly, what is the maximum amount of buzz that a new Netflix show receives these days? A week? Three days? The final series of Orange Is the New Black – consistently named Netflix’s best original programme – should have been a major publicity-grabber. Instead, the whole thing dropped at once and was buried by Glow the following week, which in turn was buried by Mindhunter. We have been trained to salivate over the hot new thing at the expense of all else, even if what came before is only a matter of days old.Furthermore, the biggest success stories of recent times have been released weekly. Game of Thrones took its time, with each new episode dominating the cultural conversation (for better or worse) more than the last. Bodyguard hinged on suspending incredible tension across several weeks in a manner that wouldn’t have worked if it had been dumped at once. Even something as everyday in its subject matter as Fleabag snowballed as it continued, with each episode drawing a more breathless reaction than the last.This has to be the main reason why Disney+ will keep things weekly. It is a clever way to maintain a stranglehold on culture. While this approach is bound to be more successful for some shows than others – you can expect suffocating global hype around the Marvel series, whereas anyone who recaps The World According to Jeff Goldblum can expect a swift kick in the pants – it is a sign that Disney+ won’t rest until it has become the world’s most dominant streaming platform.There may be another, finance-driven reason for the weekly drop – good luck watching a full two-month season of The Mandalorian with your free trial, suckers – but it seems as though the key goal is becoming unavoidable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/302da68a5498169c99fc32662883c2fbf92dc778/0_0_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b4b28ffe931d317ec600e954523dbd6","title":"burning boat california coast santa barbara los angeles","story":"Santa Barbara county fire department said that five people have been rescued and 34 are missingAt least 30 people are trapped on a burning boat off the coast of southern California, with unconfirmed reports of fatalities and a rescue operation underway.

We are so happy, we are speechless,” the zoo tweeted on Monday, posting a video of Meng Meng guiding one of her pink cubs to feed.Pandas are notoriously difficult to breed, making such births rare.The panda delivered its first cub on Saturday evening. About an hour later, a second baby was born.“Meng Meng and her two cubs coped well with the birth and are all in good health,” the zoo’s director, Andreas Knieriem, said.At birth the pink cubs, with their fine white down and disproportionately long tails, bear little resemblance to the adult black and white bears.Their sexes have not yet been determined, the zoo said. They weighed 136g and 186g.On loan from China, Meng Meng and the male panda Jiao Qing arrived in Berlin in June 2017 to great fanfare.In what is known as “panda diplomacy”, China has dispatched its national treasure to about a dozen countries as a symbol of close relations.The zoo pays $15m in a 15-year contract to host them, with most of the money going towards a conservation and breeding research programme in China.The cubs born in Berlin must be returned to China within four years after they have been weaned.China has previously given three pandas to Germany but the last one, Bao Bao, died in Berlin in 2012 at the age of 34, having become one of the oldest male pandas in the world.About 1,864 pandas remain in the wild in China, up from around 1,000 in the late 1970s, according to the environmental group WWF.Just over 400 pandas live in zoos around the world, in conservation projects set up with Beijing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd044b3ac25f5d692553cacb8a6c7afa05885365/0_150_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de940c02fd6fe4b6a2d56bb1890e5a2d","title":"iran optimism nuclear deal talks france","story":"Tehran says gap is closing on views after phone conversation between Macron and Rouhani Iran and France have moved closer in their views on the future of Tehran’s nuclear deal with the west after talks between the countries’ presidents, the Iranian government has said.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, spoke for two hours by telephone, a spokesman said, as Paris continued its diplomatic initiative to salvage the deal, which has been at risk of unravelling since the US withdrew last year.“Fortunately the points of views have become closer on many issues and now technical discussions are being held on ways to carry out the Europeans’ commitments,” said the Iranian government spokesman, Ali Rabiei.The deal was brokered in 2015 and included Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, in particular on oil exports. But after Donald Trump withdrew the US and reimposed sanctions, Tehran increased its uranium enrichment and stockpiles and threatened further breaches of the agreement.Macron has reportedly been trying to launch a $15bn credit line to pre-purchase Iran’s oil, but it is not clear if the US would allow such a move or sanction any company or country that sought to buy Iranian oil.In pulling out of the nuclear deal last year, the US vowed to drive Iran’s oil exports to zero to pressure Tehran into renegotiating the deal struck with Barack Obama. Tehran is unlikely to settle for any deal that does not allow it to export a minimum 700,000 barrels a day. Current sales have fallen to 300,000 a day.Trump has been unclear how he would renegotiate the nuclear deal, and it is likely Macron is proposing a three-stage process involving commitments by both sides that ends with an extended nuclear deal, and wider pledges. The French president has the conditional backing of the UK and Germany for his efforts.French diplomats are meeting the Iranian deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Paris on Monday to discuss outlines of the deal. France has said its objective is “to have a sequence where there are commitments on both sides”.The talks are being held against the backdrop of an Iranian threat to take a third as yet unspecified step away from the nuclear deal as early as Thursday or Friday. Tehran said this planned third reversible step would be outlined in the middle of this week. The announcement is likely to coincide with a visit to the UK by the US vice-president, Mike Pence.It also said Iran’s total stockpile of uranium, which under the accord should be no more than the equivalent of 300kg of uranium hexafluoride, now stood at roughly 360kg.In a sign of the scale of Macron’s diplomatic ambition, the French president spoke to Rouhani about the need to end the conflict in Yemen where the US has accused Tehran of trying to use the Houthi rebellion to seize de facto power, and so weaken Saudi Arabia.The US has insisted the nuclear deal can only be revived if Iran renegotiates the terms of the accord, gives wider undertakings about ending its “regional aggression” and curtails its ballistic missile programme.Trump has blown hot and cold about a summit with Rouhani, and faces conflicting advice from within his own administration. Israel and Saudi Arabia are both implacable foes of any compromise with Iran. The Iranian government spokesman on Monday suggested Rouhani could meet Trump if it served Iran’s interests, while cautioning there was no need to meet an “agitator” in the current circumstances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0d957ba498b52d9c5cd513be6778602e37fcea/0_47_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11901c00b0ffdc6f0b1e6b6656731e6e","title":"m5s online vote whether form italy coalition","story":"Country could face fresh elections if party members reject pact with centre-left PDMembers of Itay’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) party will vote online on whether they want their party to attempt to form a coalition government with the Democratic party (PD).Last week, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was tasked with securing a pact between the two parties and staving off early elections after Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, collapsed its coalition with M5S.M5S, stung by what it saw as a betrayal and keen to avoid a return to the ballot box, agreed to make an attempt to govern with the centre-left PD, which is in the process of rebuilding after a string of election defeats.About 100,000 people who subscribe to M5S’s Rousseau website will have from 9am to 6pm on Tuesday to answer the question: “Do you agree that the Five Star Movement should form a government together with the Democratic party, chaired by Giuseppe Conte?”On Sunday an M5S blog said the government programme agreed with PS would be available online to members when voting starts.The M5S senate whip, Stefano Patuanelli, said on Monday that if a majority of participants in the polls voted ‘‘no’’ then Conte would have to tell the president, Sergio Mattarella, that his attempt to form a government had failed. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, told a meeting of his deputies that everything depended on the Rousseau vote.Web-based direct democracy has been one of M5S’s core principles since it was founded in 2009 by the comedian Beppe Grillo and Gianroberto Casaleggio, an entrepreneur who died three years ago.In its early years, the movement used its website and Grillo’s blog to debate and hold votes before Rousseau, a purpose-built platform named after the 18th-century Swiss-born philosopher, was developed and introduced in 2016.But the system has been plagued by hacking attacks during key votes, and in April Italy’s data protection authority fined the company that runs the platform €50,000 (£45,000) for failing to protect users’ personal details.M5S has held dozens of online votes on key decisions, including one to elect Di Maio and another on whether to enter its previous coalition with the League. The most recent online ballot was on whether to vote in parliament to defend Salvini from prosecution for preventing migrants disembarking from an Italian coastguard ship.Italy was plunged into chaos last month when Salvini withdrew the League from its fractious alliance with M5S, as he sought to exploit his party’s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister.The dramatic move threatened to create a fully far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. Though the two parties are longstanding enemies, they are also the two largest parties in parliament.If Conte fails to form a new government, Mattarella is likely to call for new elections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a3d9cc6badd9c1483dcadeaf063e8d7f4e5e9fd/0_340_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b52b60c95c491064de82ca47afe27a1c","title":"hurricane dorian category 5 storm bahamas florida south north carolina updates","story":"Reports an eight-year-old boy has been killed after Dorian made landfall at Great Abaco Island on SundayDespite its downgrade, Dorian is still a powerful hurricane and will remain so in the coming days. There’s not much difference between an intense category 4 and a low-end category 5. Either way, the residents of the Bahamas will continue to face devastating, dangerous flooding. Per the latest predictions, the downpours (of up to 30 inches of rain), gale-force winds and the storm surge may not east up until tomorrow afternoon.The National Hurricane Center expects the hurricane to gradually weaken and has reclassified from a category 5 to a category 4. Maximum winds are at 155 miles per hour, with higher gusts. The center has also extended its storm surge warning northward along the east coast of Florida and up Georgia coast to the Savannah River — which means that more areas could face life-threatening flooding from rising water moving inland. The fact that Dorian’s has centered over some areas of the Bahamas for hours means that the islands are taking an especially intense, extended beating.According to the latest advisory from the National Hurricane Center, the Bahamas are experiencing wind gusts at up to 200 miles per hour and tides have surged 18 to 23 feet above normal levels. Residents are advised to stay sheltered, as the storm moves very slowly along its path -- currently moving at about 1 mile per hour -- concentrating the devastation over Grand Bahama Island.The Bahamas Press has named the first victim of the hurricane as seven-year-old, Lachino Mcintosh. He drowned after his family attempted to relocate their home, it reported.2019 is the fourth year running that category 5 hurricanes have formed over the Atlantic Ocean. While the overall number of hurricanes has remained roughly the same in recent decades,\u0026nbspthere is evidence\u0026nbspthey are intensifying more quickly, resulting in a greater number of the most severe category 4 and 5 storms.The proportion of tropical storms that rapidly strengthen into powerful hurricanes has tripled over the past 30 years,\u0026nbspaccording to recent research. A swift increase in pace over a 24-hour period makes hurricanes less predictable, despite improving hurricane forecasting systems, and they are more likely to cause widespread damage.There is\u0026nbspgrowing\u0026nbspevidence\u0026nbspthat the warming of the atmosphere and upper ocean, due to human activity such as burning fossil fuels, is making conditions ripe for fiercer, more destructive hurricanes.Climate breakdown is tinkering with hurricanes in a variety of ways. More moisture in the air means more rain, while storms are intensifying more quickly but often stalling once they hit land, resulting in torrential downpours that cause horrendous flooding.The expanding band of warmth around the planet’s tropical midriff also means a larger area for hurricanes to develop, resulting in fierce storms further north than before, such as Hurricane Florence. In the Pacific, this change means the focal point of typhoons is switching from the Philippines towards Japan. Oliver MilmanHubert Minnis, the prime minister of Bahamas, says the devastation in Abaco is “unprecedented”. In a tweet he added: “Our focus right now is rescue, recovery and prayer.”The Bahamas minister of foreign affairs, Darren Henfield, has given distressing video update from Abaco.He says there has been catastrophic damage and unconfirmed reports of deaths on the island. Henfield said: From all accounts we have received catastrophic damage along the front strip from Marsh Harbour ... We have been informed that Coopers Town was holding quite well. We have reports of casualties. We have reports of bodies being seen. We cannot confirm those reports until we go out and have a look for ourselves.It is not safe to go out doors. Power lines are down, lampposts are down, trees are across the street. It is very dangerous to be outdoors if you don’t have to be. As soon as the weather permits our first responders will go to those areas where we have had reports from iniduals who were in distress.We are holding strong and steady here at the government complex which we have turned into somewhat of a makeshift shelter. All of our shelters were mainly compromised. People have been coming from all four angles toward this place. We also have people sheltered in the clinic in Marsh Harbour. It is packed to capacity as I understand. Some injuries have been reported. We are holding strong we are asking you to continue to prayer for us. A resident in Freeport has posted a video purporting flooding of 6ft deep.The Nassau  reports the “nightmarish” scene in Abaco. Gertha Joseph, 35, a resident of Marsh Harbour, Abaco, stood at the top of a concrete staircase on Sunday and watched in horror as Hurricane Dorian tore through Abaco.She held her four-month-old son as she frantically pleaded for help.“Everyone, please pray for us,” she cried desperately.Around the apartment, a dark, murky storm surge had rolled in.The scene was as grim as the rest of the island.Cars were submerged and water was nearly roof-level in the distance.Roof shingles, loose wood and other pieces of debris moved with the violent rhythm of Dorian, a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds exceeding 180 miles per hour (mph).In a plea for her life, Joseph shrieked, “Please, pray for us. Pray for Abaco. I’m begging you.”Her pain-struck voice cried, “My baby’s only four months old. Please pray for us.“I’m begging y’all pray for us.“My apartment building, as we stayed in, the whole roof came off.The latest National Hurricane Center update shows the centre of the storm is still moving west at 1mph across the Bahamas with sustained winds of 165mph. “Extreme destruction” is likely to continue.Satellite images graphically show the eye Dorian moving slow west across the Bahamas."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"All bank dealings frozen by president of High CourtLatest data shows 3,778 children in emergency accommodation - a \u0026lsquosource of immense shame\u0026rsquoMillions of euro worth of damage caused by the fire at Douglas Village Shopping CentreCork car park fire witness praises efforts of staff members to evacuate shoppersIHCA says treatment waiting lists growing by 7,000 per monthCampaigner left job in journalism to work for peace in Northern IrelandT\u0026aacutenaiste says it would be wrong to think last minute deal could be reached given complexities involvedTaoiseach says claims rising cost will see other projects scrapped are \u0026lsquofake\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquomade-up\u0026rsquoThomas Kavanagh given three year sentence for possession of 10,000-volt stun gunVan driver in his 50s taken to hospital as precautionary measureFlooding caused by a breach of embankment in Shannon which was followed by high tidesMen in 40s and 50s arrested in joint operation between Garda and UK policeAll approved schemes set to go ahead despite overspend on children\u0026rsquos hospitalIncoming Solas chief hopes to include vocational \u0026lsquotaster\u0026rsquo courses in secondary schoolsCost of providing security at such sites and buildings amounted to \u0026euro339,345 last yearNine months after service introduced part-time two-year position to be filledMan attacked by 17-year-old girl gives his view on restorative justice programmeCatholic man and former British soldier use the stage to find their own route to the past"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4005187.1567432693!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pandamonium in berlin as zoo announces birth of twin cubs","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            The panda cub twins born in Berlin zoo on Saturday.

Photograph: Tobias SchwarzAFPGetty ImagesGermany is sliding towards recession, Angela Merkel’s political star is fading and US president Donald Trump has just announced a visit. In challenging times like this, there is only one antidote: baby animals.And now Berlin zoo has delivered – or rather, its panda couple Meng Meng and Jiao Qing have: doubling Berlin’s panda population on Saturday with two pink baby cubs. The news surprised Berliners who found out only a week ago – in news confirmed by ultrasound images – that Meng Meng was already 140 days pregnant.The newborns weigh 186 and 136 grams respectively but their sex has yet to be established. Videos show Meng Meng licking her blind bear cubs furiously as they emit shrieks that will soon lose their novelty with zoo neighbours.The twin arrivals on – the first panda cubs born in Germany – are likely to eclipse the torrent of excitement in 2006 around baby polar bear Knut. On Monday the zoo issued a press release detailing the births in the style of Hello! magazine.“Immediately after giving birth, the new mother knew just what to do: she placed the tiny creature gently on her belly and began to warm it lovingly with her big paws, warm breath, and the soft fur of her cheeks,” it noted. “But mother and child weren’t alone for long, as at 7.42pm – just under an hour later – a second cub was born!” Proud foster father – Berlin zoo director Andrea Knieriem – says mother and cubs are in good health. “Even though these are the first offspring born to our young female panda, she is already doing a wonderful job as a mum,” he said.Preparations for the big day resembled a royal birth, with Berlin keepers working hand in hand with Chinese experts from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Though Meng Meng and Jiao Qing have been Berliners for two years, living in a custom-built pagoda enclosure with a bamboo flat-rate, they are a 15-year loan as part of Beijing panda diplomacy.The young pandas are with their mother on alternating, two-to-three-hour shifts, and are otherwise kept in incubators. For now the new family is being kept out of public view but even before that changes, Berlin zoo is braced for a new bout of pandamonium."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4005022.1567405515!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"british solutions to avoid hard border fraught with difficulty leaked uk papers show","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA sign, erected by Border Communities Against Brexit, outside Newry, Co Down. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireAll potential British solutions to the post-Brexit Border are fraught with difficulty and would leave smaller businesses struggling to cope, UK experts have said, as leaked British government papers outline major concerns just two months before Britain is due to leave the EU.A report summarising the findings of the British government’s official “alternative arrangements” working groups concluded that there are issues with all the scenarios put forward to try to replace the backstop arrangement. There are also specific concerns over whether any technological solution could be delivered to monitor cross-Border trade.Critics said the paper, seen by the , should “ring alarm bells” across government over how likely it is that alternative arrangements to the backstop will be found.The dossier marked “official-sensitive” prepared for the EU Exit Negotiations Board is dated August 28th. It details how the findings of all advisory groups informing the government on the Border are being kept deliberately under wraps to try to avoid hampering Britain’s intended renegotiation of the backstop agreed to by former prime minister Theresa May.Alternative systems to avoid a hard border after Brexit have become the central tenet of prime minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit strategy. He sees this as a way of unlocking a new deal with Europe and has claimed that there are “abundant solutions”.However, the damning report shows there is no single deliverable solution at present, despite the fact Mr Johnson is almost a third of the way through the “30 days” target that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gave him to come up with a fresh Border proposal.The report said: “It is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.”Mr Johnson’s claim that a hard border could be avoided with mobile checks of livestock and crops was dismissed by experts as the most unlikely option to work. The report said: “Overall there were a number of concerns surrounding the deliverability of technological facilitations.”Questions were also raised over whether a trusted trader scheme - the current favourite for a Border solution - would require infrastructure to set it up.MP Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, said: “As we continue to get closer to 31 October, with Boris Johnson attempting to shut down our democracy, this leaked document rings alarm bells. It proves the government has no deliverable solution to the Irish Border, let alone being able to find one within the next few weeks.“The fact that in this document there is not a single option that can be put forward to the EU as a viable alternative to the backstop, and that No 10 do not want to release these findings as they know Boris Johnson’s bluff will be revealed, simply shows why MPs must come together to stop no deal.”The official report summarises the work of two groups tasked with coming up with Border ideas: advisory groups involving agricultural and food experts, customs and legal specialists and senior Northern Irish figures and a Whitehall-based group which is due to shortly come up with a negotiating position on how to rework the withdrawal agreement to present to the EU.Potential solutionsBorder solutions the report deems as having the most potential are listed as: Regulatory and industry assurance schemes. Trusted trader schemes. Smarter risking (a technological solution that involves data sharing).A Northern Ireland sanitary and phytosanitary zone to track contamination and disease.There were significant concerns about an artificial intelligence option, which experts felt might not detect disease and chemical contamination of food.Onboard vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods was also considered risky if a lorry might suddenly be taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle.Physical goods checks through mobile units could take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to “targeting” and staff could be at risk, it said.Significantly, smaller businesses in Northern Ireland could suffer through the additional administration required to send and receive goods across the Border, as well as other constraints and costs, the report found. They might also struggle with data collection or be unwilling to share information due to concerns around privacy.“This is because they do not have the existing systems in place and are more likely to have non-standardised products and product ranges,” it said.“However, we and other departments have cautioned against this given the potential negative impacts on the renegotiation with the EU and we understand No 10 are in agreement ?”A spokesperson for the DExEU said: “We don’t comment on leaked documents.”Over the weekend, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Ireland would not agree to drop the backstop merely for the “political convenience” of the British prime minister.In a forthright interview with the Sunday Business Post newspaper, he said: “There isn’t a single EU member state putting pressure on Ireland to move away from that position, despite the fact that the UK has spoken to all of them and used all of the persuasion that they can muster to actually move countries away from that position.”He said dropping the backstop would only create problems for Ireland further down the line. “I’m not going to pretend to people that we can do that for political convenience now to get a deal, and then find that Irish politics is dominated by the Border issue indefinitely into the future. We’re not doing that,” he said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

That’s a crazy situation that needs an immediate remedy.   Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that addressing teacher wages is long overdue and much needed.  He went on: Raising the starting salary of teachers would be a significant step forward but we also need to see an improvement to teachers’ pay across the board to ensure that we are able to retain experienced teachers in the profession.  It is also vital that any increase in salaries is fully funded by the government and that it does not fall on school budgets which are already under severe strain.Department for EducationThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Users will be able to switch it on and off directly from the Quick Settings menu.Arguably the biggest change to Android 10’s design is the removal of the back button. Alongside the Home and app tabs buttons at the bottom of the screen, the back button has been a stable of the Android OS since its inception.\u0026nbspIn its place comes a gesture-based method of navigation, which requires users to swipe the screen from the left or right to go back, depending on the settings.As with any major change, the removal of the back button is likely to prove isive among long-term Android users.\u0026nbspGoogle appeared to accidentally reveal the release date of Android 10 in August, when two separate customer support agents let slip its arrival during online chats with customers.When asked when the new operating system would be rolled out for the Google Pixel 3a smartphone, both agents said it would arrive on 3 September, 2019.AFPGetty Images)Google does not officially comment on rumour or speculation, however Android updates suggest it will first be launched on Google’s Pixel range of smartphones.It is expected that all versions of the Pixel, Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 will be the first to receive the new mobile operating system, despite the fact the original Pixel phone is outside of Google’s stated two-year support window.Other manufacturers that make use of Android, such as Samsung and Sony, will then receive the new OS in the coming weeks and months.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The next leg of the journey involves something we’ve always been interested in: the connection between our associates and our customers.”The behind-the-scenes app is called R-World and it is highly useful. First there’s a section called TB Inspo, short for Thomas Burberry Inspiration, which has information about the store that\u0026nbspthe sales associates use. “The sales associates have played an important part in developing aspects of the way the app has grown,” Morris says. “So, there are certain features and functionality that we have, which we just wouldn’t have thought of ourselves as a central product team.”“Well, certainly in TB Inspo we didn’t think the daily news component was very important. And the associates told us ‘No, you absolutely need that.’ When we introduced it, associates’ usage increased dramatically. And it’s not that that information wasn’t available elsewhere, it was, but just not in a way that was easy for them to engage with. So suddenly, with something that looks kind of like an Instagram feed, you can just look, engage for a minute each morning and learn three key things.”R-World is also a stock management tool. Associates can launch a camera function in the app to scan barcodes on a scarf or a trenchcoat and instantly discover what the stock levels are, plus in which of the multiple storerooms the stock is. No longer does an associate keep a customer waiting while searching through more than a dozen distant rooms.“Stock management can be quite difficult as an associate, when people are asking things for you, you’re hunting back of house, it’s not very easy. Having a scanning functionality that works in low light conditions and has live information means you’re able to spend more face time with the customer. If an associate is gone for 10 minutes, then then they’ve broken the moment. Things like that make that core relationship more seamless.”The R-World app also lets associates check client details and sends a birthday email, if the customer has been happy to share their date of birth.R-Message is a messaging component, you’ll be unsurprised to hear, that is going live now for customers in the Manchester store and to be rolled out to other stores. It’ll appear in the regular Burberry consumer app, but only for selected customers, based partly on spend and purchase frequency. It means that sales associates will be able to send messages to the chosen clients in a personal and direct way.So, an associate could follow up on a sale with a message asking how the purchase worked out and offering a few other options, building what Burberry calls a digital rail of images that the customer can choose from. It all appears seamlessly in the app and the customer can buy any item directly if they wish. The texting that happens is as sophisticated as in other apps, showing when the customer or associate has read the message and so on.Apple worked in depth with Burberry’s app development team to help create both the customer and staff-focused apps, as it does with many companies. Its experts are available to businesses of any size, who can ask for advice about mobile strategy, building apps and more. Apple also publishes two books aimed at enterprise, available without charge to help get customers started.Apple’s work with Burberry was also free of charge. Sure, it doesn’t hurt that Burberry has bought a large number of iPhones from Apple – every sales associate has one to use, for instance – but it remains an impressive level of help.Apple works with companies such as SAP, IBM, Cisco and more to create ways of helping organisations build and distribute apps. The Burberry apps use SAP – and since more than three quarters of global transactions involve an SAP system, you can see why. SAP and Apple jointly created the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS as a way of rapidly building apps.Apple releases strange new iPhone updateMorris recognises, though, that for all this help, it’s down to Burberry to assess just how to use the app, to make sure the associates aren’t, say, getting in touch too often.“Generally, people are fondly disposed to what they see as a luxury company. The relationship is important to them. But you shouldn’t be expecting people to interact with you every day.I think with tools like this, it’s working out what the right frequency is to speak to people. So, I think if you start with your top tier customer, this is someone that’s engaged with you, the associates here will already be talking with them on the phone and other mediums. This just gives them more ability to manage that in a seamless way. But I do think that this is about augmenting the human connection. It will be that balance of the Associate who has the relationship with this person and then has the right information we can put into their hands to help them manage those tasks.”It’s early days, then, and the app, and how it’s used, will change with time. As Morris says, “I think we’ll just have to see how it develops because it’s personalised and it’s about that inidual relationship. So, I think we’ll learn what the right balance is as we develop.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Investment continued to peter out and heightened concerns about the UK’s political situation and the strength of the global economy acted as a drag on activity.“As Brexit planning intensifies, some firms were resorting to more inventory building whilst others were unravelling their stocks. With some supplies impacted by port delays and poor supplier performance, a creeping dread is descending on the sector that there will be more of these obstacles to come.”Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, he tells Andy Martin, he’s proud of building an ‘unknown little British tech company’ that can take on the likes of giants like AppleClick to followThe IndependentJohn Shermer, the founder of Lightwave, had some of his best ideas in borstal. He was teaching delinquent teenagers in Birmingham back in the 1980s. “I used to think software was some kind of lingerie,” he says.Then he discovered the Acorn BBC Micro. “There was this kid, aged 16, put away for a double murder. He couldn’t read or write. He’d pick a fight rather than answer a question. But if you put him in front of a computer, his behaviour changed – for the better.”If he got it wrong, he could start again. “He could fail without humiliation,” says Shermer when we meet up in London. The computer had infinite patience and it wasn’t judgemental.Which is what gave him the idea to build a dedicated computer room for the other inmates and develop what became known as “Tech4Good”, inspiring otherwise underskilled young people. Working for the NHS with EU funding, he was soon tailoring tech around Europe to improve the lives of anyone with a disability.There was a man in Antwerp with a brainstem injury who could only twitch a finger: Shermer dreamed up a glove with sensors that enabled him to type. He adapted a Psion organiser to give a voice to a woman who had lost the power of speech. The victim of a road accident who could only move his chin was able to operate a keyboard Shermer had tweaked. “The tragedy was that these were one-offs and not generally available,” he says.And everything cost too much. He made a plug-in power outlet you could control with the blink of an eye (literally). But each unit cost £150 each and he could only make a few hundred.The idea of starting his own company was to bring the price down and\u0026nbspmake more units – for anyone and everyone, with or without a disability. “The\u0026nbspNHS\u0026nbspwas spending millions but I didn’t think they were spending it wisely,” he explains, adding: “My wife was appalled when I quit.” But he got the price down to £10 per unit and was making 10,000 at a time.\u0026nbspNow 63, Shermer was born in West Bromwich. His father worked on Spaghetti Junction and the young Shermer would go to the factory on a Saturday to watch him putting it together. He built his own hi-fi from scratch aged 11. He was chronically dyslexic\u0026nbsp(as are his own children) but was saved by predictive typing and audiobooks. Shermer describes his job as “liberating people”.He was inspired in part by a meeting with Stephen Hawking in the mid-90s at the Dorchester in London, when they talked about the future of disability and tech. Lightwave started off, 12 years ago, enabling NHS patients to be independent at home.Even if they couldn’t move too well they could still turn the lights on and off and answer the phone. It was smart home technology before it became fashionable. “We changed the lives of thousands of people,” he says. “You had to make it simple and it had to be robust: people’s lives depended on it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fundamental physics is flawed. The waves won’t go through walls. The frequency is wrong.” Lightwave, however, uses a dedicated radio protocol.The emergence of the smartphone transformed the business for Shermer. “It’s democratising,” he says. Anyone can use their phone to control all the appliances in their home, remotely. In January 2012,\u0026nbspLightwave produced a pioneering “gateway” device for a house. “We made all the mistakes,” he says, “but now it works.”Lightwave is still based in Birmingham and uses local engineers.\u0026nbspThey design all their own apps. He started with two employees and now it’s up to 60-plus. He reckons that dyslexia helps\u0026nbspin some ways. “I can’t write long reports but I can stand and talk all day long,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I can’t code either, but I do have the ideas.” He carries a “daybook” around with him in which he sets down his latest brainwave.Shermer says that Alexa and other virtual assistants have also made a big difference on the domestic front. Fifty per cent\u0026nbspof all commands are now sent via voice. His own mother is 87. “She can’t use a computer but she can still talk to Alexa,” he says.Shermer is proud of being “an unknown little British tech company” up against the giants of the industry. “They’re still getting it wrong,” he says. Apple invited him to Ireland for talks. They wanted to put an Apple chip in all his products and gave him 48 hours to consider. Shermer said he didn’t need 48 hours and turned them down flat. “We’re dealing with people’s lives,” he said. “It has to work.” Now Lightwave products are on sale in Apple stores.How two childhood friends became sports-pub matchmakers‘Don’t be afraid of AI’: Daniel Pitchford debunks technology mythsHow Daniel Nivern created an international recruitment agency in ChinaWhether you have dementia or you’re easily distracted, it’s useful to have the kind of kit that can spot if you left the cooker on.\u0026nbsp “We don’t make gadgets,” Shermer says dismissively. “We make things that screw to the fabric of your house. Stuff that’s permanent and increases the value of your home.” Lightwave are also collaborating with housing providers and companies such as\u0026nbspHoneywell to create iPhone-ready homes. The technology is built into the architecture.Shermer now works with the likes of Google and Amazon. “But we stand our corner,” he says. He reckons that the larger companies are at a disadvantage in that they produce generic products, whereas Lightwave can be more bespoke. “They’re top-down, whereas we grew up looking at it from the user’s point of view.”Shermer reckons he could also come up with a much better system for Hawking if he was still around. “It was a slow, stilted conversation with him. He would take a minute to say ‘I agree’. And it was an American voice system. There are still tens of thousands in his situation who would benefit.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Anything below 50 indicates that the sector is contracting. Similar figures for construction and the UK’s dominant services sector\u0026nbspwill follow later this week.\u0026nbspTo put it in context, these are the worst numbers in seven years.PMI survey reveals biggest slide in UK construction output since 2009UK manufacturing suffers sharpest contraction in over six years – PMIServices growth falls for first time since September The assumption in the City was that, with Britain’s car plants having ended the temporary shutdowns imposed ahead of the last no deal Brexit cliff edge in the Spring, there would be a modest improvement. That it hasn’t happened looks ominous.\u0026nbspBut, but, but look at Germany, tends to be the stock response of Brexiteers when confronted with figures like this. This is a cynical attempt to deflect attention from the problems they have created and the damage they are doing to the economy.\u0026nbspIt is, however, quite true that the figures were also\u0026nbspimpact by a generally chilly economic climate.The global \u0026nbsppicture is not a pretty one\u0026nbspand it is affecting manufacturers across the Western world including, yes, Germany.\u0026nbspBut I would draw your attention to a very good point in response to the figures\u0026nbspmade by Simon French, the chief economist at broker Panmure Gordon.\u0026nbspHe says that while it is true that the 7-year low in UK manufacturing is generally in line with the (weak) global picture, EU and Chinese PMI numbers have started to stabilise in stark contrast to the UK (and the US) which are still trending downwards.\u0026nbspIn economics, the trend is just as important as the bare numbersWhich, of course, brings us to back Brexit, and the uncertainty it is wreaking. It inevitably serves to make a shaky global situation worse for British industry and the people who work in it. Behind the numbers are real people with real livelihoods which are under threat. That should not be forgotten.Created with Sketch.

It takes two of these in a row to tick that particular boxAt\u0026nbspthe moment, it’s a little early to be speculating. It’s worth noting that the PMIs are heavily influenced by sentiment and while they are often a good pointer, the picture they paint isn’t always reflected in the official GDP data.Manufacturing is also dwarfed by services in the UK.

Investment continued to peter out and heightened concerns about the UK’s political situation and the strength of the global economy acted as a drag on activity.“As Brexit planning intensifies, some firms were resorting to more inventory building whilst others were unravelling their stocks. With some supplies impacted by port delays and poor supplier performance, a creeping dread is descending on the sector that there will be more of these obstacles to come.”Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: “The current high degree of market uncertainty, both at home and abroad, and currency volatility will need to reduce significantly if UK manufacturing is to make any positive strides towards recovery in the coming months.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The plant, which makes steels used in electrical transmission, had been up for sale since May 2018.Henrik Adam, chief executive of Tata’s European operations, said: “This is necessary, enabling us to focus our resources, including investment, on our core business and markets, helping\u0026nbspus build a long-term sustainable future in Europe.“Continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges. We saw no prospects of returning the Orb business to profitability in the coming years.“I recognise how difficult this news will be for all those affected and we will work very hard to support them.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of the Royal Southern Yacht Club and the Island Sailing Club take part during the annual cricket match between the clubs, which takes place on the Bramble Bank sandbank in the middle of the Solent at low tideAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate at Whitehall in LondonOne of the iconic \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 artworks by anonymous street artist Banksy is carried near one of the original locations the artwork appeared at on the Southbank in LondonThe sun rises over the sculpture The Couple by artist Sean Henry, at Newbiggin-by-the-sea in NorthumberlandA person wearing a Boris Johnson \u0027head\u0027 digs a grave at the foot of a tombstone during a protest organised by Avaaz and Best for Britain, outside Downing Street in LondonNat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

The Canadian site, which employees nearly 300 people,\u0026nbspis to\u0026nbspbe bought by Japanese firm JFE Shoji. The smaller Swedish plant, which has 100 staff and manufactures advanced steel for electrical vehicles,\u0026nbspis to be retained by Tata.But the company said its Newport factory had been “loss-making for several years” as it struggled to compete in a fast-moving market “in which customer requirements have outstripped the site’s capability”. Converting the factory to produce steel for electrical vehicles would cost more than £50m, Tata added.An\u0026nbspengineering steels service centre in Wolverhampton is also set\u0026nbspto close after Tata was unable to find a buyer. Up to 26 jobs are at risk, including at a sales office in Bolton.British Steel subsidiary sold to French firm, protecting 400 jobsSteelworkers trade union Community called the closures “devastating” and urged the government to intervene. Union leaders believe Tata had committed to safeguarding jobs as part of a 2017 rescue deal under which workers accepted reduced pension benefits.Roy Rickhuss, Community general secretary, said: “This is shocking news, which makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee. There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when the government wants to decarbonise the economy and support a switch to electric vehicles, losing the UK’s only producer of electrical steels would be a grave error.”Jessica Morden, MP for Newport East, said the closure of the plant was “tragic”. She added: “This is devastating news for the highly skilled workforce and their families. The Orb steelworks has been at the heart of Newport community since 1898.“What is particularly tragic is that this the only UK plant with the potential to produce electric steels for motors and with investment, vision and government backing this could be the key part of the supply chain for electric vehicles.”The government said the closure was “a commercial decision for Tata” but it would remain “in regular contact with the company, unions and other partners throughout this process”.Last week a subsidiary of British Steel, which collapsed in May, was bought by French-owned Systra Group\u0026nbspin deal which protected 400 jobs in York.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It appears to have then been assumed to be new details rather than a round-up of existing ones.iPhones have been having \u0027monitoring implants\u0027 installed for yearsIt suggests there will be three different phones, as repeatedly rumoured in previous leaks. As with other leaks, it suggests they will be named the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max as such, they will keep the general line-up as the existing phones, though with different names.Otherwise, it simply repeats what is known about the new phones. It suggests they will look the same as the existing models but will have a much larger camera array on the back, with an extra lens, and that the camera will be the biggest upgrade in the new phones.The only very new rumour is that the Pro versions of the iPhone 11 will include the ability to use the Apple Pencil, and may come with a smaller version of the stylus. Such a rumour seems unlikely, especially given much has leaked about the new phone and that has included no references to any new stylus.It also makes detailed reference to the specs of the phone, including a rumour that they will have more RAM than their predecessors. But there is nothing to indicate that will be the case, especially given that Apple is usually not especially open about how much RAM is in each phone, even when they have been released.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started.

The Canadian site, which employees nearly 300 people,\u0026nbspis to\u0026nbspbe bought by Japanese firm JFE Shoji. The smaller Swedish plant, which has 100 staff and manufactures advanced steel for electrical vehicles,\u0026nbspis to be retained by Tata.But the company said its Newport factory had been “loss-making for several years” as it struggled to compete in a fast-moving market “in which customer requirements have outstripped the site’s capability”. Converting the factory to produce steel for electrical vehicles would cost more than £50m, Tata added.An\u0026nbspengineering steels service centre in Wolverhampton is also set\u0026nbspto close after Tata was unable to find a buyer. Up to 26 jobs are at risk, including at a sales office in Bolton.British Steel subsidiary sold to French firm, protecting 400 jobsSteelworkers trade union Community called the closures “devastating” and urged the government to intervene. Union leaders believe Tata had committed to safeguarding jobs as part of a 2017 rescue deal under which workers accepted reduced pension benefits.Roy Rickhuss, Community general secretary, said: “This is shocking news, which makes a mockery of the understanding we reached with Tata around the jobs guarantee. There has been no consultation about this proposal either at UK or European level and company management should hang their heads in shame in the way this has come about.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when the government wants to decarbonise the economy and support a switch to electric vehicles, losing the UK’s only producer of electrical steels would be a grave error.”Jessica Morden, MP for Newport East, said the closure of the plant was “tragic”. She added: “This is devastating news for the highly skilled workforce and their families. The Orb steelworks has been at the heart of Newport community since 1898.“What is particularly tragic is that this the only UK plant with the potential to produce electric steels for motors and with investment, vision and government backing this could be the key part of the supply chain for electric vehicles.”The government said the closure was “a commercial decision for Tata” but it would remain “in regular contact with the company, unions and other partners throughout this process”.Last week a subsidiary of British Steel, which collapsed in May, was bought by French-owned Systra Group\u0026nbspin deal which protected 400 jobs in York.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In Brandenburg, a state adjacent to Berlin, the centre-left SPD remained the largest party with 26 per cent of the vote, while the AfD trailed with 23.5 per cent. In Saxony, the centre-right CDU topped the polls with 32.5 per cent, with the AfD behind on 27.8 per cent.\u0026nbspThe AfD increased its vote by 11 per cent and 18 per cent respectively on the last state elections, showing that while it may not be set to dominate German politics, it is seemingly here to stay as a major force - particularly in the East of the country.We\u0027re satisfied in Brandenburg as well as in Saxony, AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland said, claiming his party had punished Angela Merkel\u0027s CDU.Students protest against lecturer standing for far-right AfD partyGermany\u0027s far-right AfD banned from attending Holocaust memorialsGerman teachers mass report themselves to far-right AfDThe higher-than-expected turnout reflects recent trends elsewhere in Europe. In Sweden last year, the far-right Sweden Democrats were denied a victory in national elections after more voters turned out than in previous years to oppose them than had been expected.A study from the academics at the LSE Conflict and Civil Society Research Unit, released on Sunday found a significant difference between the composition of AfD support in west Germany and East Germany.\u0026nbspNeither a high unemployment rate nor living in a neighbourhood with a higher proportion of foreigners corresponds to a greater willingness to vote for the AfD, they found.\u0026nbspIn the West, the AfD scores particularly well where voters have below-average household incomes andor work in the manufacturing industry.\u0026nbspWorkers and the unemployed, although overrepresented among AfD voters in comparison to other parties, account for only a quarter of the total AfD electorate. The remaining three quarters are salaried employees, civil servants and the self-employed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They confirm the AfD’s status as a major force in the East of Germany.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

Well, now it’s his turn to squirm.I have no idea of his exact involvement with the hideous pervert Jeffrey Epstein during their “friendship”, but this week one of Epstein’s alleged victims claimed she had sex with Andrew three times. Virginia Roberts, photographed being embraced by the prince when she was a teenager, claimed he “knows exactly what he has done” and should “come clean” about it.The waters are being muddied with claims by “friends” of Andrew the photo is fake. He strenuously denies any wrongdoing but this story is not going to go away and people are demanding answers.Epstein hanged himself in his New York jail cell this month while on sex-trafficking charges — and sparked conspiracy theories galore.Andrew claims he knew nothing about Epstein’s disgusting lestyle, but it is baffling that he continued to associate with him even after Epstein’s conviction in  for procuring an underage girl for prostitution, making him a registered sex offender.Why on Earth would anyone continue to hang out with such an unsavoury character, especially , like Andrew, you are a dad with two daughters of your own  At the very least this scandal shows that Andrew has appalling judgment when it comes to his pals and associates.He has previous when it comes to cosying up to the rich and dubious.

That might not be the case this time around. He’s very lucky that the Queen continues to stand by him. Andrew is always cited as her favourite child and Her Majesty accepts her son’s vehement denials when it comes to Epstein.He also has the full support of ex-we Sarah Ferguson, who knows all too well what it is like to be caught up in a scandal. She was apparently financially “assisted” by Epstein, something she now regrets.Sarah and Andrew have been lying low on holiday together, sparking rumours they are back together. But even this odd couple realised Andrew playing his usual rounds of golf in the Spanish sunshine looked callous.They are back for “crisis talks” and I don’t envy the royal advisers who have to try to spin this one. No one is saying Andrew has committed any sort of crime, but anything that has Epstein’s grubby fingerprints all over it inevitably reeks to high heaven.And the Prince has done his reputation irreparable harm by his association with such a contemptible sexual predator. We are light years away from the dashing young prince who won the respect and admiration of the British public for his role in the Falklands War.He has never reached the heady heights of that level of popularity since, and clearly he never will again. But he could redeem himself by at least being willing to answer questions from investigators in the States.Being a royal should not mean he is above helping law enforcement. It might be embarrassing and uncomfortable — butAndrew has done nothing wrong, he has nothing to worry about.NEVER mind the nights drawing in, you know our summer days are numbered when Strictly rears its sequinned head. This year has the potential to be a classic.I always look forward to seeing the celebs step into the spray tan booth, embrace the glitz and rhinestones and unleash their inner as. But my ones-to-watch this year have actually already found theirs.Michelle Visage from Ru Paul’s Drag Race and ex-Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley both have big personalities, raucous laughs and are women after my own heart.Michelle has been very open about her struggles with an eating disorder, and recently had her breast implants removed due to health concerns. She’s a fierce campaigner for more understanding about the side-effects of breast enhancement ops.Catherine has always wanted to be a dancer but said this week that being overweight as a youngster scuppered her chances of tripping the light fantastic.She famously lost st and promotes sensible eating and exercise as the only way to shed weight, which is something I’ve been banging on about forever. Both are at the top of their game and raring to go.They will burn up the dancefloor and provide us with some memorable moments . . .  but as they are both happily married, these will all thankfully be Strictly confined to the ballroom floor.WHAT in the name of Rule Britannia is going on with British Airways  They are lurching from crisis to crisis, with computer glitches and strikes almost becoming the norm.Last week I had to cancel a long-awaited trip to Orkney because of the proposed industrial action next month by BA pilots, after receiving an email to say my flight had been axed. With a heavy heart, I apologetically cancelled the glorious Foveran Hotel, our car hire and the babysitter for our dog son Angus.The next day another computer-generated email popped up telling me that actually the flight wasn’t cancelled after all. Oops, and all that. Now I’ve been trying to get some clarity from the BA hotline for days – with no joy.I’m reluctant to rebook everything in case it all goes t*ts-up again and they cancel the flights for a second time. It’s infuriating, stressful and upsetting. Behind every cancelled or delayed flight are heartbreaking stories of people missing weddings, hospital visits, funerals and job interviews.Can I stress emphatically that, in my experience, BA staff at the check-in coal face, who have to deal with distraught and angry passengers when flights are cancelled or delayed, deserve a blinking medal for their patience and forbearance in dealing with the recent avalanche of almighty management cock-ups.Likewise, those battling valiantly in customer service, and all of the stalwart cabin crew, especially those with years of experience who are unfailingly professional, caring and kind.They are being as badly let down as us passengers, and it’s depressing to see a once proud and noble British brand shooting itself in the foot.Those at the very top really don’t deserve their hardworking staff and they also have to stop taking us customers for granted.NORMALLY I view those “scientic studies” about the benefits or detriments of certain food and drink with folded arms and a very sceptical: “Aye, right.”It might, however, be worth paying attention to the very latest one which concludes that red wine really is good for you.We already knew about the benefits for your heart, but now it turns out red wine could improve digestion and protect you against issues with high cholesterol.I reckon the men and women in white lab coats have a point.Cheers!I’VE been lucky enough to have spent the past couple of weeks travelling around Rajasthan in India.I happily scoffed some form of curry three times a day for every meal and guzzled very impressive Indian wine.I’m now addicted to dosa with daal and spicy mint sauce for breakfast – followed throughout the day by chilli paneer and laal maas all washed down with endless cups of masala tea.Halfway through the trip, I rather naively posted a snap of myself, right, taken by the pool during our stay in Shahpura Bagh, on the way to Jodhpur. It showed that my excess holiday baggage had mainly landed around my tummy.Some people were very kind about my -year-old unfiltered, non- Photoshopped body, my make-up-free face and flyaway hair. Others not so much.All I wanted to do was show that you don’t have to be body perfect to wear a bikini and smile in the sunshine when you are on holiday.We shouldn’t feel embarrassed about a few lumps and bumps or scars and blemishes and we need to stop beating ourselves up all the time and learn to celebrate our so-called flaws. Le really is too short.SHAME on all of those chortling at little Prince George because he is taking ballet lessons. I’m sure none of the mockers have ever actually met a male ballet dancer.Those fellas are as tough as nails.They can beat a bully into a pulp with one flick of their sinewy wrists. They are mentally and physically fiercely strong.I can’t think of a better way for the future king to learn discipline, teamwork and how to push himself to the limit.

With the connivance of the Speaker John Bercow, they will almost certainly succeed.Having gained this power, they will set about binding Boris Johnson’s hands. They will try to legislate to ensure this country cannot leave the European Union without a deal.Do they have the numbers to pull this off  Probably, yes.The ranks of Tory rebels have been swelled by the arrival of former Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond and David Gauke, and the Government’s decision to prorogue Parliament means that plans to wait until the end of September to act have been dropped.One former minister says the “prorogation scandal has tipped things over the edge”.If they have the numbers, do they have the time  This is more doubtful.No’s decision to prorogue Parliament means they would have to get a bill through both Houses in just over a week. With Bercow’s help, it will be possible for them to rush it through the Commons quickly. But it will be much harder to do that in the Lords.One Brexit-backing former Secretary of State tells me: “Our lot down there will do their best to talk it out.”Eventhe rebels can get a bill passed, the Government’s actions this week are designed to show that they won’t simply comply with it. They want the rebels to think they can’t succeed unless they change the government. “The aim is to force a binary choice between Corbyn and our Brexit plan,” is how one of those at the heart of things explains it.Those close to Boris Johnson believe this is their best chance of getting things through. They calculate that, ultimately, the Commons will not be prepared to take the risk of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.This is a high-risk manoeuvre. But so far, the thought of putting Corbyn in No even temporarily has proved too much for all but a couple of the Tory rebels.At the same time, Boris is trying to reassure Tory MPs that he really is trying for a deal. I understand that next week, Amber Rudd — the Work and Pensions Secretary who campaigned for Remain in  — will join with him as part of an effort to persuade Tory MPs not to back the rebel legislation, and to give him time to secure a deal.I am told she was “disappointed” by his decision to prorogue but remains convinced he is genuine about getting a deal and that the EU will offer concessionsParliament backs the Government next week.The biggest problem with the extension the rebels want is they can’t say what it is for. The reason is they can’t agree on what its purpose should be: Many want to stop Brexit altogether, others just to block No Deal.An extension without a purpose would do nothing but prolong the uncertainty and keep this country in limbo. It is time to get on with it.Why, because No think most voters just want Brexit done, so they want to be talking about the public’s priorities.They think they win whenever Boris is seen on the news discussing these issues. The polls suggest the PM is having some success with this approach. One Secretary of State puts the current Tory poll lead down to BoJo being: “Very effective at giving them hope of a non-Brexit dominated world.”Of course, another reason why the PM wants to keep hammering home his domestic priorities is that we are going to end up having a general election in the next few months.l IN another sign that a general election is coming, I am informed that the Scottish Tories will not select their new leader until AFTER such a poll.The decision to stick with an interim leader following Ruth Davidson’s resignation suggests the  hierarchy north of the border doesn’t think there is  time to have a proper leadership contest before any general election.We will clearly all be heading to the polling station sooner, rather than later.ANY Tory MP who votes for the extension legislation next week will not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election.I understand No have decided to treat next week’s votes as they would a confidence vote, with anyone not backing the Government being immediately disqualied from standing for the party again. They hope this will keep some Tory waverers in the Government lobby next week.It would mean thatformer Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again, ending their time as Tory MPs.  It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party.This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger  MPs will still rebel  then decide  they have nothing left to lose, increasing not only the chances of them voting down the Government in a no-confidence vote, but also backing an alternative prime minister.Currently, only about ten per cent of Home Office grants to charities go to those with an income of less than £million a year, compared to the sixty-odd per cent which goes to those with an income of £million plus a year.The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has been impressed by the efforts of charities such as OnSide, which work to keep kids off the street.One ally of the Home Secretary says that more police and greater stop and search powers are, “only one side of the coin”,  in terms of dealing with kne crime and that “there are lots of kids with nothing to do and that’s a big reason so many are falling in with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble.“There are some great small charities out there giving them a purpose beyond a le of crime, and they deserve more support.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And guess what has been highlighted by charity experts as the main cause “Excessive social media use.”Anyone surprised by that either  Thought not.Of course, not all children are unhappy. But parents should take this news as a serious warning shot. Because when it comes to our children’s happiness, the trend is clearly going in the wrong direction.With social media, the problem is partly one of expectations.Most grown-ups are seasoned enough to take the inevitable “my perfect le” posts on Instagram with a pinch of salt.Butyou are new to these things, being bombarded with images on your mate’s Instagram page of the le you are “meant” to be living could make even the most secure children begin to feel inadequate.The other problem is that it’s always “on” — and so are our kids. It used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and leave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again. Hot weather is great when you are lying around in swimwear next to a pool . . .  notyou are sitting in a classroom or office.I  loved the photos of Dame Joan Collins, , lined up with the other stars of the Charlotte Tilbury makeup campaign.What a lady. Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Henry McMaster and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp both announced mandatory evacuation orders to take effect at noon Monday.The South Carolina order covers all of Beaufort and Charleston counties and parts of the rest of the states coastal counties, which state officials estimated covered , people.The Georgia order covers people who live east of Interstate  in the counties along the Atlantic coast that includes Savannah and most of its , residents.Mandatory evacuation orders in Florida are for low-lying and flood-prone areas and mobile homes.These take effect starting either Sunday or Monday from Palm Beach County north to at least the Daytona Beach area.More than  Labor Day flights in the US have been cancelled, many of them in Florida as Hurricane Dorian barrels toward the state’s coast.Officials have blasted social media idiots after videos appeared online of daredevils riding into the storm on inflatable boats in mph winds.One man filmed himself in the rain, just  miles from the eye of the hurricane, while another is seen trying to navigate a small boat in choppy waters, both in the Bahamas.The National Hurricane Center tweeted a warning about the danger of the storm last night.They said: IMPORTANT: We have seen videos in the Abacos of people venturing out in the eye of #Dorian. Everyone should take shelter immediately as winds will increase rapidly and unpredictably after the eye passes.Others posted videos showing homes missing parts of their roofs, downed power lines and smashed and overturned cars.Hundreds of residents on the island of Grand Bahamas have already fled from its predicted path amid official warnings the storm surge could be le-threatening and as high as ft in places.And the pummelling is expected to last for hours as the hurricane may slow to just one mph prolonging its catastrophic effects, the NHC said.Dorian has also grown larger in size, with hurricane-force winds currently extending  miles from the storms centre and  is now the second strongest hurricane on modern record in the region.With winds at  mph, Dorian ties with Gilbert , Wilma . Only Allen in  was more powerful with mph winds.Bahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis begged residents of Abaco and Grand Bahamas to head for the main island to escape the devastating, dangerous storm.I want you to remember: homes, houses, structures can be replaced. Lives cannot be replaced, he said.He added that , people and , homes were at risk to storm surges.Still, dozens of people ignored evacuation orders, officials said, and they were warned that they were placing their lives in danger.  Silbert Mills, owner of the Bahamas Christian Network, said trees and power lines were torn down in The Abaco Islands and some roads were impassable.The winds are howling like weve never, ever experienced before, said Mills, , who planned to ride out the hurricane with his family in the concrete home he built  years ago in central Abaco.This is a le-threatening situation, the NHC warned. Residents there should take immediate shelter. Do not venture into the eyeit passes over your location.The eye of the storm - now at the highest possible category - is expected to lay waste to the Abaco Islands before barrelling northwards to Florida and Georgia.Even a glancing blow from one of the strongest storms ever to menace Florida could bring torrential rains and damaging winds.On Great Guana Cay, just off Great Abaco Island, waves began washing over low-lying parts of the tiny nine-mile strand of land.Although some residents left for Nassau and where days ago, some  to  are riding out the storm on the island.US President Donald Trump warned on Sunday that the storm would likely impact the eastern seaboard from Florida to North Carolina.Mr Trump later tweeted: Pray for the people in the Bahamas. Being hit like never before, Category . Almost  MPH winds.According to tracking site FlightAware,  flights to, from or within America were cancelled on Saturday.And as of this morning another  planes were grounded for US trips scheduled for Sunday.The site said: “We expect these numbers to increase in the upcoming days, especially at airports in the region where Dorian is to make landfall.”Airlines have been issuing waivers to customers for several days for journeys which are heading to destinations in the hurricane’s path, reports CNN.While travel firms have issued advisories to cities in Florida, Georgia and the Caribbean – more waiver options will be issued for the Carolinas as the massive storm moves northwards up the east coast.Radar shows the eye of Hurricane Dorian during a reconnaissance mission over the Atlantic OceanOperations at Orlando International Airport will be suspended at am Monday local time, according to an official statement.Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale International Airport have yet to confirm what action they will take and are monitoring the hurricane’s path, it has been reported.The storm is predicted to take the same route as Category  Matthew took three years ago – hugging the southern east coast of the country while still causing billions of dollars of damage.The killer hurricane devastated the four states bringing wind and flood damage, killing  and leaving millions without power.But Bryan Norcross, a senior hurricane specialist, told Florida Today that Dorian is moving even slower than Matthew which means it could wreak more havoc on the sunshine state.He said: “As it stands right now, coastal Florida has got to be ready for storm surge exceeding Matthew. And higher winds than Matthew. And heavier rain than Matthew.The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is based on a hurricanes sustained wind speed.Just be ready for that. We’re in a position where you’re talking three, four, five days in advance of what you have to be ready for.“The threat is real from the Treasure Coast throughout the Florida peninsula. The trend is somewhat favourable — though the danger is still high along the immediate coastline.”The devastation caused by Dorian could be made worse by exceptionally strong tides called King Tide -which makes coastal areas more vulnerable to flooding.The super-strength tide happens around the time as a full moon or new moon and this year the King Tides have already flooded neighbourhoods in Miami - and the most recent full moon was yesterday.The storms winds reached mph today - just mph shy of becoming a Category  hurricane.Winds are currently raging over the warm Atlantic waters and is inching towards the northwestern Bahamas, according to the US National Hurricane Center.The centre says the storms path is still unpredictable, but Georgia and the Carolinas are now at risk of strong winds and le-threatening storm surge.They said: It should be noted that the new forecast track does not preclude Dorian making landfall on the Florida coast, as large portions of the coast remain in the track cone of uncertainty.Supermarket shelves have been left bare as residents scramble to prepare for the Category  storm.Sunday: Dorians hurricane siege will begin in the northwest Bahamas as it continues to slow down. Tropical storm-force winds may begin to arrive in parts of Florida. Large swells should begin to arrive at the coast from North Carolina to Florida.Monday: Dorian may still be hammering the northwest Bahamas as it crawls slowly. Bands of rain, strong winds may affect parts of Florida. How strong the winds will be depends on how close the center of Dorian is to the Florida coast, which is uncertain at this time.Tuesday-Thursday: Dorian is expected to move north, then northeast near the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The exact track is very uncertain, ranging from a track far enough offshore to keep hurricane force winds away from land, to a landfall anywhere in this zone.Friday-Next Saturday: Dorian is then expected to race off the Northeast Seaboard, but could track close enough to bring rain and some wind to the Virginia Tidewater, Nantucket, Marthas Vineyard and Cape Cod, before it heads toward the Canadian Maritimes by next weekend.The grocery was rationing bottled water and had run out of dry ice and homeowners and businesses rushed to cover their windows with plywood.Tfany Miranda of Miami Springs, Florida said: I feel helpless because the whole coast is threatened.You never know with these hurricanes. It could be good, it could be bad. You just have to be prepared.Jeremy Kichler, a University of Georgia extension agent in Colquitt County who works with local farmers, told local news: A lot of folks are still recovering from Irma two years ago and Michael last year.I don’t knowwe can stand another one.Residents in Bred County have been told to start leaving at am on Sunday The Weather Channel reports.FEMA official Jeff Byard said Dorian is likely to create a lot of havoc for roads, power and other infrastructure."},{"url":null,"title":"incredible life tricks invented","story":"Inventions from turning your hoody into a popcorn bowl to a door bottle opener, here are the incredible ideas you wish youd invented.Want tole hacks These tips from history have stood the test of time.Weve also revealed the quickest and easiest way to make your bed - according to the military.But luckily, these other handy tricks can often be carried out with cheap items you have lying around the house."},{"url":null,"title":"peter sutcliffe wants baby cheerleader","story":"Vile Sutclfe, , has suggested IVF with Krystal Smith, , despite them never meeting.The killer, now at Frankland jail, Co Durham, has also asked ex-we Sonia for permission to wed again.A source said: “He’s like a lovesick teen.

It’s horrendous.You’d want to establish what is a reasonable price, you can establish that, and then that becomes the right to buy.[The Government] set[s] the criteria. I don’t think it’s complicated.A brewing clash between parliament and the prime minister over the future of Brexit has seen heightened expectations of an early general election, and renewed focus on what a Labour-led government would do.The suggested policy was met with heavy criticism by Tory MPs.Michael Fabricant MP, former vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, told MailOnline: McDonnell has promised he would overturn the mixed-economy capitalist systemhe came to power.This manoeuvre is just the start.It would decimate the rental market in the UK, creating a shortage of properties available to rent.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn raised the idea of introducing a tenants right to buy policy in  during his first bid for the party leadership, but it is not yet party policy.A report commissioned by the party earlier this year also recommended caps on the amounts buy-to-let landlords could charge tenants in rent and curbs on their ability to evict rents on spurious grounds.Recent years have seen rising rents alongside falling home ownership.In ,  per cent of homes were occupied by the owner, compared to just  per cent today.Last night a spokesman for Mr McDonnell said: Ahead of the next election we will lay out our programme to really end austerity, eliminate in-work poverty and drive up living standards across the UK economy."},{"url":null,"title":"remainer rabble archbishop of canterbury brexit","story":"The left-wing, pro-Brussels, anti-No Deal prelate wants ­fellow Remainers to “stop whingeing” and accept the  referendum.It is a Damascene conversion for Dr Justin Welby.Last week he was preparing to lead a “citizens’ forum” against a clean-break Brexit.If only puce-faced boobies like Owen Jones, Stephen Fry and Hugh Grant would follow suit and stop throwing their rattles out of the pram.Along with the raving loony Labour Party and Tory ­hypocrite Sir John Major, who should know better.I used to think John Major was a well-intentioned cove, for all his failures as Prime Minister.He was roasted for trying to scrap the Pound, signing the Maastricht blueprint for a ­federal Europe — and ­suspending Parliament in the same way he now condemns as “fundamentally ­unconstitutional”.“Decent” Major emerges as a charlatan and hypocrite who is prepared to bring down a Tory PM struggling to deliver the will of the ­people — and replace it with a Marxist-led ­Labour ­rabble.Along with Phil Hammond and Dominic Grieve, he is willing to inflict terminal ­damage on the same British constitution and wreck public trust in Parliamentary ­democracy.It was Parliament whose MPs voted overwhelmingly for an In-Out referendum.It was Parliament that voted for every step towards Brexit along the way.It was Parliament that three times rejected the only EU deal on offer.And it was in Parliament, as Foreign Secretary in , that Phil Hammond lectured MPs on the paramount right of voters to choose — whatever the result of the ­referendum, saying it would be decided “not [by] Whitehall bureaucrats, certainly not ­Brussels Eurocrats, not even by government ministers or ­parliamentarians in this ­chamber.

As things began to look increasingly impossible, he sought extensions to the Article  deadline to give him time to persuade.He has now stopped bothering with Parliament. In the past  months heaposs had one day in it, and during summer promised spending sprees that were uncosted and unscrutinised.He now says he wants the worst possible Brexit. The one we were told weaposd never get.    He has prorogued Parliament for an unprecedented  days, for the equally-unprecedented reason of enacting a law Parliament first voted for and later voted against.It has been called a coup. Former Prime Ministers are queueing up to say how bad it is. The government is reduced to bullying people into a doing a thing nobody wants, while claiming itaposs what they voted for.There have been mass public demonstrations in  towns and cities. Tens of thousands of middle-class, quiet, well-behaved people have marched in the capital demanding Parliament be kept open.Jeremy Corbyn has ignored them. John McDonnell was called them childish names. Diane Abbott has told the BBC that evenParliament passed a law against Corbynaposs plans, they might not obey it.   Corbynaposs unelected henchman has taken to firing advisers. He has told every Labour MP thatthey do not support the purge wholeheartedly then they will be purged.The government proclaims loudly that the solution is obvious and simple, but wonapost tell anybody what it is. They refuse to negotiate with the EU, while stepping up talks with the EU, and claim itaposs the critics who are stopping us getting a better deal from the EU.Meanwhile, the nationaposs doctors warn the NHS cannot cope. The car industry and its m dependent jobs are expecting to be decimated. Government ministers who have previously warned people there will be food and medicine shortages now say: There will be enough food. The government spends £m on an advertising campaign with the slogan: Get ready for homeopathy.    What would Boris Johnson do, in these circumstances  He would say this was tyranny by an unelected PM. He would demand a word with the Queen. He would say Corbyn was destroying the Union and the Brexit referendum gave no mandate for any of it.He would call Corbyn a coward for ducking media interviews and running away from Westminster. He would call him Stalinist for shutting down Parliament. He would say the spending plans were mad lies and that the thousands who took to the streets were good British democrats.He would say a Labour Brexit was going to destroy the country and cost lives. He would talk about a heap of burning sheep carcasses to equal the Great Pyramid of Giza. He would demand a general election. And he would almost certainly quote Winston Churchill.    This never happened, of course. But it could have, andit did every single Conservative MP would be spitting tacks and talking about Nazis.Because a Conservative PM has done it, they say the people protesting are a mob and a rabble. They say those questioning it should not get to talk to the PM about it, because whataposs the point. What should frighten every politician - and every voter - is that the two main parties are so easily interchangeable. That they would both face the same problems with Brexit, and would be equally likely to be aiming at a general election which would keep them in power for  more years in which they couldreallylet rip.Both would seek to exploit the isions among their opponents to split the vote, earn themselves a working majority, and steamroller their policies through a weakened Parliament and onto  million people all wondering how the hell this happened.   The truth is there are no Brexits left. They have stopped promising us jam and unicorns, and are forced to confirm there will be stale bread available in as jolly a tone as they can manage.It is clear the Brexit we were sold will not manest. The one the government is about to force down our throats is not only a bad Brexit, it is merely the first mouthful of a vomitous heap of rotten fish we will be eating for the next  years as this country negotiates the actual trade deal with which our children must grow up. Because the truth is so unpalatable, they are lying. About everything. It is not Boris Johnsonaposs deepest desire to destroy Britain, any more than it is Corbynaposs. It is just that,you want Brexit, that is what any Prime Minister must do to achieve it. If you like, you can have a general election in which you either tell Johnson you donapost care what he does, or ask Corbyn to do the impossible. But donapost make the mistake of thinking it will make the least bit dference. Switch the parties, and you have the same chaos. Take away Brexit, and the chaos is gone.   We would have enormous isions, anger, and a lot more Nigel Farage. But jobs would be safe, investment would , and the EU would work to keep us happy rather than at armaposs . The splits would heal in time, and so would politics.We are close to a general election in which we will be told that a dferent party of government will mean a dferent Brexit. But itaposs Brexit itself that must be voted down. So donapost vote for parties. Vote for an anti-Brexit Parliament. Your nation, your children, and the Queen herself will all thank you for it.

I dislike the poisonous language of treachery used by Tory and Brexit Party demagogues to shout down reasonable voices warning that tearing our country out of Europe would be as disastrous as Government experts privately predict. But examine who is prepared to hammer the economy and put a bomb under democracy by sidelining the very sovereign Parliament they pretended to champion, and it is Johnson, Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nigel Farage and the rest of the Brexit bandits.    Losing every fact-based argument and rational debate, these desperadoes can no longer pretend food and medicine shortages predicted after a no-deal Brexit are part of “Project Fear” when the dire leaked assessments come from within their regime. Mass protests and opinion polls repeatedly show that the public has snfed a fraud, and folk are now likely to back staying in as the truth dawns. That is why the charlatans are terried of a fresh referendum, clinging instead to an ageing, squeaked result sneaked by lies and criminality in another Parliament, three PMs ago. MPs must unite this week to save Parliament and Britain by ruling out egomaniac Johnson’s Halloween Horror. Vowing to call an early General Election to block MPs and trigger October ’s Brexit fright night is just another miscalculation by a slippery premier who is too clever by half. Naming an election date isn’t in his gt under a Fixed Term Parliament Act requiring a two-thirds vote by MPs or Jeremy Corbyn securing two weeks to form an alternative administration after winning a no-confidence vote in Johnson. Unite to fight back against Johnson and Labour, Libs, Green, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Tory rebels may yet turn the tables on the great hoodwinker.

Campaigning neurologist Dr David Nicholl challenged the Cabinet minister to say what mortality rate he would find acceptable after October . Dr Nicholl, from Birmingham, said he was involved in drafting the governmentaposs contingency plans Operation Yellowhammer before blowing the whistle because I felt they were unsafe. But Leader of the Commons Mr Rees-Mogg snapped at the doctor, telling him he was a Remoaner who was fearmongering on public radio. The Tory hard Brexiteer fumed: There are reserve plans to fly drugs in as necessary. This is a major focus of government policy.  I think itaposs deeply irresponsible, Dr Nicholl, of you to call in and try and spread fear across the country. I think itaposs typical of Remainer campaigners and you should be quite ashamed, Iaposm afraid.Dr Nicholl has repeatedly voiced concerns about no-deal Brexit and threatened in March to stand against his local MP, Chancellor Sajid Javid , in an election. He spoke at a Change UK event and tweeted in May urging people to vote for the new anti-Brexit party. He attended a Peopleaposs Vote march in London, according to local reports, and spoke out in April to the BBC to criticise the policy of keeping no-deal documents secret. Separately, he was also involved in Amnestyaposs long-running campaign for the release of British citizen Shaker Aamer from Guantanamo Bay.His call comes three years after Michael Gove , now the no-deal Brexit planning chief, infamously said people in this country have had enough of experts. Dr Nicholl phoned LBC to tell Mr Rees-Mogg: I was actually involved in Yellowhammer and drafting the plans of mitigation for a no-deal Brexit in March. My question to you really, having being involved in writing the plans for mitigation and having whistleblown because I felt they were unsafe, is what level of mortality rate are you willing to accept in light of a no-deal Brexit  Mr Rees-Mogg replied: I donapost think there is any reason to suppose a no-deal Brexit should lead to a mortality rate. I think this is the worst excess of Project Fear. And Iaposm surprised that a doctor in your position would be fearmongering in this way on public radio. The doctor protested: I wrote the plans in mitigation. Visibly rattled, Mr Rees-Mogg snapped back :You didnapost write very good plansyou hadnapost worked out how to mitigate, had you  Itaposs fortunate they are being written by other people now who are serious about mitigating rather than Remoaners.

Mother Liliya Breha, , claimed lenient probation officers didnapost warn her that her boyfriend Marvyn Iheanacho was banned from contacting children before he fatally attacked her young son, Alex Malcolm. Iheanacho, who had a history of physically abusing girlfriends, is currently serving a le sentence for the brutal murder of Alex who suffered fatal injuries to his head and stomach. The killer flew into a violent rage when the youngster lost his shoe in a park in Catford, south east London, in November .  Witnesses described the brutal blows as sounding like two men fighting, Southwark Coroneraposs Court was told. Senior Coroner Dr Andrew Harris said: This occurred about eight times and sounded to one witness as somebody was throwing metal items in a skip. Alex died in hospital two days later after Iheanacho lted his limp body over his shoulder and got a taxi to Liliyaaposs home in Beckenham, south east London, instead of taking him to a nearby hospital in Lewisham. Iheanacho then beat cleaner Ms Breha in her home and forced her to lie to the police and Alex was only was seen by ambulance after he turned blue two-and-a-half hours after the attack. The killer committed the fatal attack just six months after being released on licence from prison. He had been jailed for a string of brutal assaults on previous girlfriends, dating back to .  Southwark Coroneraposs Court heard he had been using dating sites and targeting single mothers with children - despite being released on licence banning him from unsupervised contact with children under . Today Ms Breha slammed a probation officer for a lack of common sense after they failed to tell her Iheanachoaposs licence conditions. Ms Breha also claimed the woman probation officer had been lenient with Iheanacho about rearranging appointments and had even joked with him over the phone. Speaking of phone calls Iheanacho had with his probation officer and herself in June , she said: I can definitely remember there was some joking. She didnapost askI had any kids orhe stayed with me or anything like that. I heard how he spoke to her on the phone and he was never forced to come to his appointment.  I can see how lenient they were with him, and it never struck me that there were any serious issues with him. I thinkit was something serious, from my point of view, they would have told me or just asked questions, aposdo you have kids apos Thataposs just common sense. Describing Alex, she said: He was a beautul five-year-old. He always made flowers for me. I miss him and his voice so much, I miss his cute smile. He was my world and Iaposm so angry someone took this boy from me. My son didnapost deserve this. Everyone loved Alex, he had so many friends. He was my best friend too. He was caring, kind, loving. He was perfect, he was smart with so much potential. He was the first person who truly loved me and the one I loved. She said a neighbour introduced her to Iheanacho and they wrote to each other while he was in prison before they first met in person in June  a month after his release. Ms Breha said: I did trust him and I donapost judge people whether theyaposve been in prison or not. At the time he only said he was sentenced for eight months and because heaposs innocent heaposs coming out. When I met his family, none of them I met said he was a danger to kids. He was around many kids and I never had any concerns or suspicions or anything that he could harm anyone. She said she didnapost remember him ever hitting her son before the fatal attack. She said: Alex had speech dficulties so I always pushed him to do the language therapy. The only thing he would always say was he wanted his mummy and daddy together. She said she later found a notebook of Iheanacho as she was clearing his belongings from her home a month after the killing, which detailed how fake he had been. Ms Breha said: I just remember finding the notebook. He was just really fake and manipulative and lying and I just donapost think he was nice to Alex behind my back. She confirmed thataposs right when Dr Harris read a statement from her, saying: You can say without a shadow of a doubt that had you been warned you would have stopped your relationship with him right away. Thereaposs no wayyou had would have been in a relationship with Marvynyou had known his history of violence against women and children. She claimed she didnapost remember being hit by him before the incident, but the inquest heard Iheanacho had a string of previous convictions for assaulting girlfriends dating back to . Reading them out, the coroner said they included him punching a girlfriend aged , striking another with a hammer, punching a girlfriend unconscious in  because she refused to lend a phone, breaking her jaw. He also throttled a partner in  and in  was jailed for whipping a girlfriend and grabbing her by the throat.

I’ve been coming this way for years and I had no idea it had changed. “I only realised it was now a bus lane when I was actually on the road and saw the lettering on the tarmac. “By then it was too late. “Once you’re on there you don’t have a second chance.”  Sheepcote Street, at the back of the Arena Birmingham, was a popular way for motorists to access the city’s busy Broad Street.

Then there is the stationery, the PE kit and the natural worries about them making new friends. But a minority of mums and dads panic over whether their precious little ones will even make it to the safety of hometime. Clare Hussein says every school day she struggles with the worry that she may never see her child alive again. Her nine-year-old daughter has been battling le-threatening allergies all her le. She is currently diagnosed with  conditions that could cause her to have an anaphylactic shock, stop breathing and die at any time. She is allergic to ying substances, from nuts and milk to tomatoes and dust. And so when Clare packs her off with a medical kit - containing two adrenaline auto-injectors and instructions for staff - her heart is in her mouth. The -year-old mum, from Portsmouth, said: We are handing the control over to someone , who hasnapost lived with it, presumably they havenapost seen a severe reaction and they have  children to look after. Have you got a back to school story  Email webnews@mirror    Clare says a constant barrage of questions consume her mind - will the teacher understand what might happen  Are they prepared  Have I given then enough information  What about lunchtime - who serves the food, is it safe  Will the dinner ladies understand and know what symptoms to look our for  Can they do this with many other children to take care of too  Are they close enough to the emergency medication  Do they know how to use it  And the list goes on. The mum added: No day goes by without wondering, worrying and double guessing yourself. Sending your child off to school for the first time feels like the scariest thing in the world. Not because they might be upset or scared, although that is also a worry, but because they have le threatening allergies and handing over the care of your child to another person is fraught with anxiety.    She continued: Any day you wave them off could be the last time you see them. There are so many dangers to a child with severe allergies, at any point something could go wrong and the consequences can be a hospital visit or worse. Clare, who works part time while studying for a degree in Childhood, Youth Studies and Psychology at Portsmouth University, says she tries hard to create a balance for her little girl. I canapost ever be in a situation where I donapost have a phone, she said. The chance is small, but itaposs always there. And it is constant round of aposwhat sapos. Clare says her daughter is now learning to check labels but manufactures often change ingredients or factory conditions, turning once safe safe products into a danger.

Abdul Choudhury, his we and their four children, from Etruria in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, had booked a one-week holiday to Milan to visit relatives they hadnapost seen for  years. But they were forced to scrap their trip after a National Express coach got them to Manchester Airport almost two hours late. They desperately sprinted to their boarding gate but by the time they got there were told their plane had already left. Now Abdul, who has been left £. out of pocket, wants the company to refund the cost of his flight, reports Stoke-on-Trent Live. Have you had a holiday from hell  Email webnews@mirror    Recalling the nightmare ordeal, he said: It was a very stressful day, my we was really upset and so were the children. They were falling on the floor crying because they were really excited. We were meeting with relatives who we hadnapost seen for  years and we had to let them down as well. The kids are going back to school now so that was our last chance to visit them. The coach had been scheduled to leave Hanley bus station at .pm and arrive at the airport at .pm - two-and-a-half hours before the familyaposs flight at pm. However, it didnapost leave until .pm. The family were dropped off at Terminal  at .pm - a -minute walk away from Terminal .  The family made it through security but as they ran to their gate they were told the Ryanair flight had left without them. Abdul was offered alternative flights at a cost of £, but this was not an option so the family got the train home and missed their one-week break. National Express has offered to refund their coach and rail travel on the day - but -year-old Abdul believes they should also refund the £. cost of his flights. Abdul said: We got to the bus station at pm for the .pm coach. It got to about .pm and then the time on the board changed to .pm.   I went to the counter to ask what had happened and they said it was delayed in Birmingham. I told them that I had a flight at pm but they just said they didnapost know what was happening because they werenapost from National Express.  So we decided to wait becausethe coach got there for .pm we would still get to the airport at .pm, but it didnapost arrive until .pm. I explained to the driver that weaposd got a flight at pm and he told us not to worry and started driving. But it was rush-hour and it took us  minutes to pass Basford roundabout. When we got to Terminal  we had to run for  minutes like we were in a marathon with four children and our bags. When we got to our gate they said our flight had gone.  We then had to get the train home to Stoke-on-Trent and we didnapost get back until .pm. Abdul added: National Express says it is willing to refund the coach and train travel, but not the money for our fights. But we missed the flight because of them and it needs to be responsible for it. National Express had my email address and phone number so could have easily text me to let us know the coach was running late so we could arrange alternative transport but when the time had changed to .pm it was already too late. It was a traumatic experience for us. Iaposll never use National Express again for the airport.

Thereaposs nothing more frustrating than opening up that lunch box in the evening and seeing the feast you lovingly prepared only half eaten. ChangeLe nutritionist Orla Hugueniot is a mum herself so she knows just how dficult it can be to get little ones to get kids to eat up - but sheaposs got some tips and tricks to make sure they get a full and nutritious meal every day. Speaking to , she said: Weaposre all trying to do our best. We need to remember that itaposs a great opportunity to get some key nutritions into your kidaposs diet.    We know that kids arenapost getting their five a day and theyaposre having too much sugar. As a parent I know this is dficult. We all want to make sure our kids are getting to have a lunch that theyaposre going to eat and enjoy. No parents want their kidsapos lunch boxes to come home with them having not eaten anything. Thataposs why parents end up putting a lot of things in. We need to get the core elements right. The core elements are a carby main - sandwiches, a bagel or a wrap - fruit or a salad and a sweet apostreat.    Orla believes that we can get our kids to eat the right things by making some easy swaps. There are always going to be things that they are going to enjoy eating, and we can make some swaps. When it comes to sandwiches, try swapping white bread for wholemeal as it will keep your little one fuller for longer. Ditching sugary yogurts in favour of natural alternatives with raisins to add sweetness will also cut the sugar down drastically. She also suggests mixing it up a bit to keep children interested rather than serving the same thing day after day. She said: One of the biggest things is the issue of always providing the same thing. As parents we find something the kids like but eventually theyaposll get tired of it.    Having a bit of a plan about what youaposre going to do during the week is a big help. She suggests trying wraps and bagels instead or normal sandwiches, and highlights ChangeLeaposs Meal Mixer app which gives lots of fun food ideas. Orla knows that the hardest bit of the lunch box can be finding a sweet treat that isnapost filled with sugar - and that fits in with the schoolaposs meal code. She suggests swapping chocolate or cake bars for malt load or tea cakes, which are much better for them. Her other snack ideas include:Malt loaf slice Fresh or tinned fruit salad Sugar-free jelly A crumpet A scotch pancake Plain rice cakes or crackers with lower-fat cheese Lower-fat, lower-sugar fromage frais and yogurtBut when it comes to making changes Orla stresses that itaposs important to understand that itaposs not just going to happen overnight.

Lucy Smith has been diagnosed with a rare brain tumour for which there is no treatment. Her devastated parents Dwayne and Sarah have been told Lucy has just six to nine months to live.Mum Sarah, from Donaghmede in north Dublin initially thought her daughteraposs symptoms might be a sign of an allergy, the Irish Mirror reports.But after an emergency visit to Temple Street Childrenaposs Hospital, Lucy was diagnosed with a rare tumour called DIPG - dfuse intrinsic pontine glioma.  Sarah initially noticed something was wrong when Lucy seemed listless and wasnapost out playing with the other children. The little girl also vomited a few times which led mum-of-six Sarah to think Lucy might have a food allergy. She told The Irish Sun: I just noticed Lucy wasnapost really involved and she was more tired than usual. “I made the appointment to try our local GP who told me that it could be the heat, and that she probably wasnapost able for it. “She told me watch what she was eating because she did vomit a few times. I was thinking it was maybe reflux or some sort of food allergy.” Lucy seemed to be on the mend for a while but then she collapsed just as the family were preparing for a trip to Dublin Zoo. Sarah said: On the morning we were due to go the zoo, Lucy didn’t look herself at all, her whole complexion changed. Her eyes rolled to the back of her head and she wet herself. “As I was bringing her up to get changed, she just went limp and that’s when I panicked and shouted at Lucy’s dad Dwayne to get an ambulance.  Paramedics told Sarah they thought Lucy might have a viral infection but she realised it was more serious when doctors ordered a scan. She said: They wanted to do all these tests and when they said they were keeping her in and they wanted to do an MRI scan, that’s when my heart started racing and I knew something was wrong. “Dwayne came in the next morning and we went and spoke to the doctor and that’s when we were told.” The family were told Lucyaposs illness was terminal and they could only offer palliative radiotherapy. Lucy underwent emergency surgery and a shunt was inserted in her head to drain fluid from her brain. Her parents decided not to proceed with radiotherapy and have brought her home to make the most of their time together. The family have placed Lucy on a plant-based diet since her diagnosis. Sarah said: “Since she’s been home, she’s back to herself, she’s doing so well.

The trio enjoyed video nights at Kensington Palace and Diana was determined her young sons would follow in her footsteps when it came to championing charitable causes. In a moving interview with Martin Bashir she stressed she wanted them to have an understanding of peopleaposs emotions, peopleaposs insecurities, peopleaposs distress, and peopleaposs hopes and dreams. The two princes are often compared to their caring mother with their charity work and the way they deal with members of the public. And Diana made sure they were aware how fortunate they were from an early age.    She said: I take them round homelessness projects, Iaposve taken William and Harry to people dying of Aids - albeit I told them it was cancer - Iaposve taken the children to all sorts of areas where Iaposm not sure anyone of that age in this family has been before. And they have a knowledge - they may never use it, but the seed is there, and I hope it will grow because knowledge is power. But when William was just  and his younger brother, Harry, was just , their world fell apart when their beloved mum was killed in a car accident in Paris on August , . Her sons were on holiday with their father, Prince Charles, at Balmoral when the call came through about the tragedy. Charles was the first person to be told, in a phone call, about his ex-weaposs death.    Stunned, he informed the Queen, and the two of them tried to come up with a way of shielding the two young princes from the worst of the tragedy. But Harry was determined to fulfil one final wish for his beloved mother - he wanted to travel to Paris with his father to collect her body. Charles, desperate to protect his young son, refused the request, and instead travelled alone to bring Dianaaposs body back to Britain. Journalist and friend of Diana, Richard Kay said: The Queen and Prince Charlesapos view was that the boys were their main priority. However, Charlesapos decision to travel with Dianaaposs body himself caused a huge rt with his mother, the Queen.    Richard said: Charles took the decision that he was going to Paris to bring back Dianaaposs body. This was a surprising and brave move. He was an ex-husband, he had no right to be there other than as the father of her sons. Charles wanted to take the royal flight to Paris but the Queen wouldnapost allow it. Charles fought harder for Diana than he had ever fought for her in her letime. The Prince of Wales refused to back down and eventually the Queen agreed to allow him to fly on the royal plane to bring his ex-weaposs body back to Britain.    Following Dianaaposs death, Harry has admitted his struggles with grief. It inspired him to set up mental health initiatives to encourage other people to open up about their feelings. He has said he regrets not opening up sooner about the death of his mother. In a powerful documentary last year Harry said he refused to accept his mother was gone. He also praised Prince Charles for always being there for him following Dianaaposs death.    Harry said about his initial reaction to being told, while at Balmoral, that his mother was dead: “Disbelief, refused to accept it. “There was no sort of sudden outpour of grief.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen always orders same takeaway","story":"NewsQueen always orders same takeaway in Balmoral - and its not very royalHer Majesty heads to Balmoral each summer and a royal source said she always orders fish and chips on special occasionsShareCommentsByBrendan McFadden:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video queen-greeted-royal-regiment-scotland-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

White supremacist David Parnham, , sent similar letters containing white powder to then-prime minister Theresa May , two bishops and the Home Office in October , making an apparent reference to reports of attacks by people dressed up as clowns.A Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclearresponse was launched as a result, the Old Bailey was told. Members of the Royal Household were left concerned for their health and the well-being of their colleagues.    Some were kept separate from other staff for hours as the substance was being identied. Parnham also caused widespread fear and upset through a Punish A Muslim Day hate campaign, the court heard. Democrat peer Lord Hussain told of his total shock at receiving one of the poison letters. It had been forwarded to him from the House of Lords to his home address while he was unwell. He wrote in a victim impact statement read out in court: As I read it for the first time I felt total shock at its contents as well as fear, not only for myself but for my family, my home and all other Muslims. I have lived in this country for  years and have never before seen or read anything like this. Parnham, from Lincoln, has pleaded guilty to  offences relating to hundreds of letters penned between June  and June . He has admitted encouraging murder, making hoaxes involving noxious substances and bombs, sending letters with intent to cause distress, and encouraging offences. As he appeared in court for a sentencing hearing, a psychiatrist revealed that the defendant did not regret what he had done and did not consider it particularly serious.    Dr Martin Lock said: He told mehe went to prison it would be one to two years. The court heard that Parnham claimed he did not remember writing to the Queen. While Parnham was on the autistic spectrum, Dr Lock said he was not psychotic and expressed concern that the defendant had attempted to mislead medical professionals. The court heard that Parnhamaposs activities first came to the attention of authorities in July  when seven of letters were intercepted at Sheffield mail centre and found to contain harmless white powder. A further  letters were identied as having been delivered. A letter to former PM David Cameron contained the wording Allah is great, while letters to MPs and mosques contained the wording Paki Filth. In October , more letters containing white powder stated that the clowns R coming  you and were intended to reach the Queen and Mrs May.  In December , Parnham sent a fan letter to Dylann Roof, a white supremacist responsible for shooting nine black parishioners dead in Charleston, South Carolina. He told Roof: I just wanted to thank you for opening my eyes. Ever since you carried out what Iaposd call the aposcleansingapos Iaposve felt dferently about what youaposd call aposracial awarenessapos. In February , letters were sent to ious mosques and Islamic centres around the county. A letter to Berkeley Street Mosque in Hull contained a drawing of a sword with a swastika on it cutting someoneaposs head off, with the words You are going to be slaughtered very soon.

Phoebe Rose, , and her big sister, Sophie Thomson, , had their babies just six hours apart at the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham.Their due dates had been just one day apart but they never imagined how it would all turn out. The older sister found out she was six weeks pregnant just a few days before Phoebe called her to break her own news. Baby Nellie was the first to arrive after Phoebe went into labour, and proud aunt Sophie arrived at hospital to visit her new niece, already in labour. With the sistersapos mum Lynda, , running between their beds, Sophie gave birth to baby Nancie six hours after Nellie was born. The whole experience has brought the siblings closer together than ever before, so much so that they now only live four doors down from each other. The cousins, who are best friends, celebrated their fourth birthday together this week - just as they have each birthday before. They are also due to start school in the same class.    Team leader Sophie, from Nottingham, said: I visited Phoebe in the hospital and I was literally doubled over with contractions by the side of her bed, so I knew it was time to go. I said goodbye to Phoebe and my gorgeous niece and then was taken straight to the delivery suite. The midwe came over and said sheaposd just delivered my sisteraposs baby, so hoped she could help deliver mine as well, and of course I said yes. Phoebe, a community carer added: When we found out we were pregnant at the same time, we never dreamt of giving birth on the same day, but Iaposm so glad it all happened the way it did. Iaposm forever grateful to have gone through this with Sophie. She was my rock throughout it all and I hope Nellie and Nancy grow up to be as close as we are.    When Phoebe text her sister Sophie that she was feeling unwell back in January , she was surprised when her sibling suggested taking a pregnancy test. The test came up positive, and when Phoebe rang her sister back with her unexpected news, she had no idea that Sophie was pregnant as well. Phoebe, who has partner Greg, , said: As soon as the little positive lines came up on the screen, I knew I had to phone Sophie back immediately. I was in such a state of shock at my own news, I could barely process it when Sophie told me she was pregnant too.  Sophie and her husband Jonny had been keeping it quiet that they were trying for a baby, but emotions took over when her sister told her she was pregnant. The siblings had a tearful phone conversation where they both excitedly shared their news and realised theyaposd be going through their pregnancies together. Sophie said: Weaposd been trying for a baby, and Iaposd only just found out a few days before that I was six weeks pregnant so Iaposd kept it between me and Jonny at that point. When Phoebe said sheaposd not been feeling well, I immediately suggested she take a test, but I was totally surprised when she rang back to say she was pregnant. I had been trying to keep it quiet until I hit the  week mark, but when Phoebe rang me with her news I couldnapost hold the secret in any longer. My due date was the day before Sophieaposs and as soon as we found that out, everybody was joking weaposd give birth on the same day.  As their baby bumps grew bigger, the two sisters grew closer, sharing in every experience of pregnancy together. This was Sophieaposs third child but only Phoebeaposs first, and having the comfort of a big sister knowing exactly what she was going through was a blessing. Phoebe said: My pregnancy wasnapost planned so I was really nervous and didnapost know what to expect over the next nine months. Thankfully, Sophie was there to hold my hand at every corner and we even shared in the same symptoms at the same time. My baby would start kicking at the same time as Sophieaposs, and it was incredible being able to share those special moments with each other. We both decided to find out the genders of our babies, and to learn we would be having two little girls who could grow up together just like we did was amazing. As their pregnancies drew to a close, Phoebe was admitted into hospital with high blood pressure and was eventually induced three days after her due date.After a long  hour labour, Phoebe finally gave birth to a beautul little girl called Nellie on st August , but the drama wasnapost over yet. Team Leader Sophie said: I was three days past my due date, and I knew Phoebe had been called in to be induced, when I felt these movements in the early hours of the morning. Iaposd had two children before so I knew exactly what it was, but thought no it canapost be, Phoebe is in labour right now, surely I canapost be as well  Their sister connection proved to be stronger than ever as Sophie went into labour just moments after Phoebe had given birth. Arriving at the same hospital, Sophie was immediately looked after by the very same midwe that had delivered Phoebeaposs daughter.  Phoebe said: I was cradling Nellie in the hospital bed, absolutely exhausted, when my midwe came back into the room and said Sophie had phoned to say she was in labour. I couldnapost believe it was actually happening. Moments later, she burst into the hospital room, leaning over in pain as the contractions took over her - I couldnapost believe it. Seeing her pained face as she went through each contraction made me really grateful that Iaposd given birth first as I think it would have really scared me to see her like that before. My mum was racing between the pair of us.  Not wanting to miss out on the fun, Sophieaposs daughter Nancie was born just six hours after Nellie, and the two sisters could finally relax. The whole experience has brought the siblings closer together than ever before, so much so that they now only live four doors down from each other. Nellie and Nancie are growing up to be thick as thieves and love to celebrate their birthday together each year.

Investigators who want to interview Frenchman Jean-Luc Brunel, , say he is a “ghost who has disappeared without trace”. It is understood enquires are being made in Brazil, the US and Europe. French prosecutors have opened their own inquiry into the crimes of American financier Epstein, . The convicted paedophile, a friend of Prince Andrew, committed suicide in jail on August  while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges. Brunel, who helped found the New York model agency MC and is credited with finding supermodels such as Christy Turlington, has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.    It was claimed Russian ex-model Svetlana Pozhidaeva, who was signed to MC, was pictured at Epstein’s New York mansion in . Ms Pozhidaeva, the daughter of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Red Army, has denied it is her in the photo. A day before it was taken, Prince Andrew was photographed standing in the doorway of Epstein’s home. One of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Roberts, has alleged she slept with the Duke of York three times, which he has strongly denied. He has also denied knowing anything about Epstein’s illegal activities.    Roberts also claimed to have slept with Brunel “many times” when she was aged  to . Many of the girls said to have been used by Epstein were allegedly “sourced” in Paris, where the American owned a £million apartment. Brunel, who also lived in the city, was known to be scouring Brazil for new talent until early this summer. French prosecutors this month opened a preliminary inquiry into whether Epstein sexually abused French minors. Authorities say it is “urgent” Brunel is interviewed. But one Paris legal source said: “He is a ghost who has disappeared without trace.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d63e2fec534c2.18919648-406x564.jpg ","title":"bard of salford john cooper clarke promises a right good night in dundee visit","story":"John Cooper Clarke is ready to rock# and Dundee should be afraid, very afraid.He may be in his older years, but he is not holding back.And the man known as the punk poet has vowed to perform in his unmistakable style – machine gun delivery studded with factory floor language.The rasping Salford accent is still there and the humour as cutting as a surgeon’s scalpel.And for the real devotees, John has teased them by telling the Tele exclusively that he has begun planning his memoirs.In typical fashion he says: “I haven’t kept a f****** diary, but I have got a good memory.“In fact, my memory is long and my vengeance is total.”To the musicians and celebs who have crossed JCC in the past, start praying now because the master could even recall the gig I saw him perform at Strathclyde University in the early s and who was playing on the same bill.For the record, it was Siouxsie and the Banshees – and I couldn’t remember that, despite being a few years younger than the man.Back in the day, John easily recalls everyone being angry young men and women.

It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays.

There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now.

Towards the back end of last season, Tannadice started to get full and the crowd’s been great.“They’ve been really loud, even last Saturday there was a tangerine wall behind me.“I think it does translate onto us.

Though, we need to fight our battleswe want to come through and play.“With the talent we have, we need to match everybody ’s work ethic.

with a close range effort.Ross County twice hit the woodwork, once from the penalty spot.Aberdeen made four changes to the side that stuttered to a dire - stalemate with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park last weekend.Two were enforced with Scott McKenna and Shaleum Logan both ruled out through injury.Centre-back McKenna is out for up to a month with a hamstring tear suffered on the articial surface at Rugby Park.Right-back Logan was ruled out having undergone a minor procedure on a groin problem.It meant Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes had only four fit defenders available # with no defensive back up on the bench.However they secured a clean sheet.Wingers Ryan Hedges and Niall McGinn both ed to the starting line-up with James Wilson and Jon Gallagher dropping to the bench.Aberdeen began with attacking intent and forced two corners inside the opening two minutes but both came to nothing.The Reds should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when Ryan Hedges played a quick free quick to release Niall McGinn on the right flank.McGinn#ss low cross was palmed out by keeper Ross Laidlaw as far as Sam Cosgrove who capitalized to shoot low from  yards only to have his shot cleared off the line by Keith Watson.Aberdeen spurned another glorious opportunity in the th minute when Greg Leigh broke down the left and squared a pass into the penalty area but with the goal beckoning McGinn lted it high over the bar from  yards.In the rd minute Ferguson curled a free kick from the left into the box which Mikey Devlin met but his  yard glancing header flew wide.The Dons two game Premiership goal drought ended in the th minute with a set piece straight off the training ground.Rather than fire a free kick  yards out directly into the penalty area McGinn slid it wide to the unmarked Hedges on the right who immediately whipped in a curling cross that found LEIGH.The left-back powered home a  yard header beyond keeper Laidlaw.Aberdeen doubled their advantage two minutes later when Ferguson was clumsily brought down in the box by keeper Laidlaw.Leading scorer COSGROVE comfortably converted to the keeper#s left hand side for his th goal of the season.Aberdeen made it # in the th minute when McGinn cut inside on the left and delivered a superb cross towards the back post and HEDGES raced from the right to slide it in from close range.A minute later Ross County were awarded a penalty by referee Nick Walsh when a powerful drive from Stewart hit Funso Ojo#s hand from close range.Ojo was booked. Staggies failed to capitalize as Billy McKay#s spot kick rattled Joe Leiws# right hand post.Aberdeen continued to threaten when McGinn shot over the bar then minutes later Cosgrove had an effort saved by keeper Laidlaw.In the th minute Stewart broke in on goal and unleashed a curling shot that cracked off the far post from  yards.

It shows what can be done when we are more positive with our possession and positive with our runs and forward play.“Last week we talked a lot about the lack of intent and lack of quality and movement in the forward areas.“We got that this time and also got that quality and the goals.“We had a front three pulling and running the back lot of Ross County.“We had two very strong running performances fromBryson andFerguson in the middle of the park making good runs beyond and supporting.“Our full-backs also got up high and did well.“The intent from everybody to go and get that first goal and impose ourselves on the game was there.“I was delighted for my players and they deserve a lot of credit.”After a recent scoring drought McInnes hailed his team for refusing to let spurned chances frustrate them.The opener eventually came when Greg Leigh headed home.Cosgrove netted the second from the penalty spot moments later for his th goal of the season to put the Dons - up at half-time.Welsh international Ryan Hedges scored the third.McInnes said: “We passed up one or two good opportunities to get the first goal.“After that the players could have thought that it was not going to happen.“They could easily have let their heads go down but they stuck to their task.“They really kept at it to get the three points, and to send the supporters home happy.”Referee Nick Walsh awarded both sides a penalty and McInnes believes both decisions were the right call.Aberdeen’s spot-kick came in the first half when Ross County keeper Ross Laidlaw clumsily brought down Lewis Ferguson.Cosgrove converted to make it  goals in  starts.The Staggies were also awarded a penalty in the second half when a shot from Ross Stewart hit Funso Ojo’s hand.Belgian international Ojo was also yellow carded for the handball.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

The tragedy is I cannot tell my grandchildren the same because we messed up.ldquoBut so long as there are young people like those I met on Zomba Plateau about, we can have hope and faith in a future where all can share the bounty of this beautul creation.Afterwards, the youngsters moved on to the Liwonde Game Reserve where they helped restore no less than fourteen houses damaged in the severe floods of March.Then everyone got to experience a safari drive, many of whom for the first time, seeing elephants, hippos, warthogs, and lions up close.Also, a site visit was arranged to YONECO, one of the main sponsors of the camp, to learn of their special approach to promoting youth empowerment.To reinforce the talk the RYLA participants engaged with the women who live on the Plateau and men who make a living there passing on their newfound knowledge on how to minimise the effects of Climate Change.And handed out mango plants in small plastic sleeves that will provide a crop of fruit in three years.Nineteen-year-old leader, John Little said: ldquoThe pilot Malawi RYLA camp was a massive success. Over the week I saw impressive personal growth in the confidence and leadership of all participants, including myself.ldquoIrsquom proud of everyone involved as we delivered a yearsrsquo worth of

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10345671.jpg?type=article-full","title":"celebrate-tastes-scotland-scottish-food-drink-fortnight","story":"AldomakAldomak are a Scottish confectionery business established in  in Glasgow, supplying the ice cream trade.They manufacture Scottish Tablet, Fudge and Macaroon for a wide array of independents, supermarkets and the tourist trade, and have also branched out into making Handmade Meringues on a large scale, supplying farm shops, delis, hotels and cafes across Scotland.Aldomak are proud of their handmade artisanal credentials and over the years have spent time reimaging traditional recipes and scaling these recipes into large batches, whereby the confectioners pour and cut these by hand, to retain rustic products their customers love.They have also brought two of their own brands to the market, Confectious and Bonnie Glen which was a huge investment for the business.With Aldomak recently being awarded two  stars in the prestigious Great Taste Awards for their Bonnie Glen Vanilla Fudge and Butter Tablet, this validates the quality of their confectionery.Aldomakrsquos MD Dario Riccomini is clearly delighted with how things are going, stating that  has been a good year for the company in raising the profile of the business.

So the teammade a conscious decision to use all the meat from the carcase, specically the prime cuts, in thesausages and burgers and it has made a huge dference to the taste and succulence of the product. Why not have an everyday product with the best ingredients The pork meat is available all year round giving customers a steady supply of their staple shopping and this is then boosted with seasonal lamb, game and beef. When theygo to the markets people just love the story of the farm and that theycan basically point to the field where the animals are being reared.The flavours and dferent products have been created in collaboration with thelocal butcher and theirrange of wild venison is sourced from local estates, shot by a member of the Scottish Deer Society.Springfield Game and Country Meatsare looking to develop flavours without detracting from the flavour of the meat and product, you donrsquot need to hide quality. Theyare both genuinely surprised about how quickly the brand has taken off and how popular the products have become. Theyhave already managed to create links with local restaurants who are happy to promote local food producers andwere a finalist for best Artisan Food producer at the Scottish Rural Awards , which has been a welcome jolt of recognition.www.springfieldmeatsFACEBOOK @springfieldcountrymeats"},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smith-bids-fond-farewell-herald-diary","story":"I turned to see the head of editor Harry Reid hovering behind the cabinets. At that time The Diary, or as everyone knew it, Tom Shields Diary, appeared in the Herald twice a week and was eagerly anticipated by readers. Harry had a plan to increase this to five days a week, although critics argued that it would be too much of a good thing and would be killing the goose that laid the golden egg.I, though, had had my fill of writing about politics, the death of Scottish industry, and murder trials. Goodness, I had even been a witness in one murder trial where I shared a witness room with enough Glasgow so-called Godfathers to fill a Mario Puzo novel. I was happy to sign up as goose killer.It was only when I mentioned it to colleagues later in The Press Bar and one of them asked about my pay rise that I realised I had not thought to ask for one. I raced back upstairs and collared managing editor Bob Jeffrey and mentioned I had taken a job without discussing money. He shook his head and said he would see what he could do. Editors shaking their heads has been a regular mot in my career.Dferent times, of course. I reckon I was the last Herald reporter to claim for a dinner suit on expenses as invitations to awards events at hotels such as the Albany, the Hilton and whatever The Thistle hotel was called that week, rained in on us. It was a younger mans game then. Drinks in the bar went on into the small hours. I was once walking home down Byres Road in my dinner suit at seven in the morning thinking it was an odd way to earn a living.But as I say, I wasnt always a dilettante. \"One of my boulediers\" as editor Arnold Kemp once described me, not unkindly I hoped. I had moved in my early twenties from weekly newspapers to the Evening Times newsroom where typewriters were still used, copy takers took your calls from the office radio car, and you were in deadly competition to file your story before the Evening Citizen.No mobile phones, of course, and in areas where phone boxes were merely stench-filled public toilets with broken handsets, you would knock on someones door, announce you were a member of Her Majestys Press, and a wee wey would graciously allow you to use her phone, planked on a table in the hall. If you were lucky she would even go away and make you a cup of tea while you were phoning. We had a better reputation back then.:Ken Smiths Diary: Takes the biscuit Gee whizz Paws for thoughtThere was no internet to glean information. Instead, you would chap doors, stop folk in the street, and quiz imbibers in local boozers. Back at the Albion Street office you would then take your break next door in The Press Bar. It was originally the Express Bar, but when the Express pulled out of Glasgow, owner Tom McEntee simply got a ladder out and unscrewed the E and the X. Not just a pub though. Cheques were cashed there in the days before ATMs, money was even borrowed, and advice was given by fellow journalists with much more experience. I once asked Des McEnteehe ever had to throw out a journalist for fighting. \"Just the one,\" he said. \"Magnus Magnusson.\" What  The mild-mannered gentleman of Mastermind fame  Yes indeed ndash but someone had insulted his we, a fellow journalist, and he had gamely thrown a punch before being guided out the door.I dont want to romanticise drinking ndash it took away too many colleagues at an early age ndash but many of the most colourful, outrageous, and yes regrettable, events in my le began with a drink in Toms as we then called it. I didnt get into a fight there but I do recall being sent to interview Billy Connolly before he caught the ferry to Rothesay to perform at a charity gig. Unbeknown to me, our Womens Editor had that day lambasted Billy in print for giving his daughters the odd names ndash well odd for Glasgow back then ndash of Scarlett and Daisy. When I introduced myself he blew up and threatened to throw me in the ClydeI followed him on the ferry. I scurried off and phoned my news editor who imperiously announced: \"The Evening Times will not be dictated to by a banjo player. Get on that ferry.\"Other stories were utterly bleak. I reported every day of the y Ice Cream Wars murder trial of TC Campbell and Joe Steele accused of killing six members of the Doyle family ndash a decent family targeted merely because a son drove an ice cream van. It was turning over the stone as the worst of Glasgow came crawling out.I then became an industrial reporter, met some of the most helpful, committed trade unionists around, but slowly realised I was overseeing the death of heavy industry in Scotland. It won me press awards as I went behind the employment numbers and reported on the human cost of jobs lost, families on poverty benefits, and workers left with little hope of working again.I once pursued the Caterpillar dispute shop stewards at a meeting off Clyde Street in Glasgow. I had to take them for a drink. Dark rum was the tipple. I eventually staggered out to sit slumped on a bench overlooking the Clyde, thinking I was about to throw up ndash dark rum is not a drink to be treated lightly. A passing jakie carrying a can of Special Brew was so concerned he stopped to askI was alright. Thats how glamorous it was at times. When the Ravenscraig workers marched to Downing Street my editor sent me with them, and of course I had to do my share of walking. I still have a statue of a foundry worker cast to mark the -day march on my desk. Lost a bit of weight mind you, which the hotel dinners later overcame.So I moved from the Evening Times to the then Glasgow Herald as I fancied the idea of using bigger words and longer sentences. I was mainly reporting still on industry but also on politics. There was a fresh-faced young leader of the SNP, an Alex Salmond, who talked of gaining power, but no one took him that seriously.And then came the move to the Diary to help Tom who eventually decided on his own move to other journalistic outlets. The paper had trundled from Albion Street to Cowcaddens, and using The Press Bar as a second office was no more. It was probably a good thing for my health. Fortunately David Belcher helped me with the Diary before he too left me to it.I was there on my own the day Sean Connery phoned from the Bahamas. He read the Diary online and he couldnt get the drt of one of the stories and could I please explain. The accent is so well-known I was looking around to seesomeone in the office was doing an impression. But no it was Sean. Didnt give me any stories though.And now it is my turn to leave and pass the Diary baton on. The dinner suit had its final journalistic outing at the Scottish Bar Awards at The Hilton last week. Fortunately I was tucked up at home well before seven in the morning. To Diary readers my heartfelt thanks in providing thousands of stories over the years. I didnt write the Diary, I was merely the conduit for the funny, observant and literate readers out there who took the time to fuel the column every day. I have a huge debt of gratitude.Before social media, readers expressed their criticism more in The Heralds letters pages. I still have the cutting when a reader wrote: \"Ken Smith in his Diary piece on Keir Hardie aims presumably at wit: what he achieves is smart-aleckry at its most crass.\" Thank you, dear readers, for putting up with my crass smart-aleckry over all these years, and play nice with the new boy.Kens last Diary will appear this Saturday.

At the recent European election, his party came fth after tumbling to %.His group of MSPs is also ided and his staunch opposition to a second independence referendum was undermined when shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that a Labour Government would not block indyref.It was against this backdrop of decline that Leonard and his MSPs met at the partyrsquos Bath Street headquarters for an away day last month.MSPs listened to polling expert John Curtice give his take on the current political situation and sessions on campaigning and media messaging were also provided.However, it was the leaderrsquos own presentation that is said to have posed more questions than it offered answers.The ldquochange formula was created by David Gleicher in the s when he worked for the Arthur D Little management consultancy.Described as a model that assesses the ldquolikely success of organisational change programs, the formula was refined in the s by author Kathie Dannemiller.The ldquoD stands for ldquodissatisfaction with how things are, ldquoV is the vision of what it is possible, and ldquoF is the ldquofirst step towards the vision.According to the theory,the product of these three factors is greater than the ldquoR in the formula, which stands for ldquoresistance, then change is possible.One party source said Leonardrsquos chief of staff, Lesley Brennan, who has a background in management consultancy, was likely responsible for the formula being included in the presentation: ldquoOur problem is that lsquoresistancersquo is the voters.

She was an exercise in confusion marketing the antithesis of the reactionary, middle-class, middle-aged, strait-laced Scottish Tory image. She talked straight, and she sometimes talked dirty.Her LGBT liberalism finally rescued Unionism from the old Rangers-supporting, Union Flag-waving, sectarian taint that dated from the days when the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party really was the Orange party.This rebranding took the Tories from the margins of politics to the main opposition in Holyrood in only three years.She then won  Westminster seats at the  General Election, more than the Democratic Unionist Party, Theresa Mayrsquos coalition partners. The likely loss of those Scottish seats at the next General Election could be crucial to the fate of the United Kingdom. It may not survive her.For First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the loss of her most dangerous foe caps her best-ever summer.Last month, the Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, came north to the Edinburgh Festival and, in a remarkable reversal of policy, announced that Labour would not stand in the way of another Scottish independence referendum. Scottish Labourrsquos leader, Richard Leonard, doesnrsquot seem to have quite got the message.Boris Johnsonrsquos election as Conservative leader and Prime Ministerwas an even greater political windfall for Sturgeon. Of all the potential candidates for Number , the Bullingdon English nationalist was the best because he was the worst. The Tories havenrsquot had a leader so out of tune with Scottish sympathies since Margaret Thatcher. His very voice seems redolent of English public school elitism.Now, Johnsonrsquos reckless pursuit of a no-deal Brexit has served to remind Scots just why they voted overwhelmingly to Remain. In this weekrsquos Herald readersrsquo survey, support for Brexit is now down to %. Some % of Scots voted to leave the EU in the  referendum.His decision to prorogue Parliament allowed Sturgeon to announce that it was a ldquodark day for democracy and accuse him of exercising dictatorial powers. As Scotland is dragged kicking and screaming out of the Europe, power is being centralised in Westminster as never before. This has renewed the debate about the powers of the Scottish Parliament. If the PM is prepared to run roughshod over Westminster, how is he going to treat Holyrood in future Davidsonrsquos departure comes not a moment too soon for the First Minister. There has been grumbling among SNP activists on social media about the lack of progress to the next independence referendum. No-one believes that Johnson will agree to one, which makes Sturgeonrsquos promise of a referendum in the second half of  sound vacuous.Why wait, said the former SNP MP George Kerevan. She should withdraw MPs from Westminster, he tweeted, and ldquodeclare an independence referendum immediately REGARDLESS of Londonrsquos permission.He added that Gandhi and Mandela ldquodidnrsquot await permission to free themselves. Many thousands of independence supporters stand ready this weekend to join a campaign of civil disobedience in support of self-government. All Sturgeon needs to do is give the word, and they would be manning, and womanning, the barricades.But I donrsquot think the First Minister is going to go down an extra-parliamentary, unconstitutional route to independence. Recalling Holyrood is a possibility, though it would have to be for a specic purpose, not a unilateral declaration of independence. She certainly wonrsquot call an unlawful Catalan-style unauthorised referendum. Nor will she withdraw MPs from Westminster. She is not a risk-taking, insurgent leader.This doesnrsquot mean Nicola Sturgeon has given up on independence, or that the Union is saved. On the contrary, the events of the past week may have destroyed the last vestiges of support for the Union in Scotland, and made some form of constitutional orce inevitable. But Sturgeon is a cautious lawyer. She is unlikely even to request a referendum unless there is a signicant increase in support for independence in the opinion polls.Support for Yes is certainly edging up over % in some polls ndash but it is painfully slow. Most Scots tell pollsters that they expect Scotland to be independent some time in the future, but that doesnrsquot translate into a demand for a referendum today. The landscape of Brexit is just too confused. We canrsquot even be sure when or how, or even , the UK is leaving the European Union.The First Minister is a gradualist, and her sights will be set, first of all, on the next General Election. She wants those  seats that she lost in  ndash that really hurt. Then there is the possibility of a hung parliament and working in some form of confidence-and-supply arrangement with Labour. Now that there is agreement on indyref, a Corbyn coalition is eminently doable.If there is no General Election, orthe Tories win again, she will concentrate, I believe, on obliterating the Tories in Scotland in . She has really hated them being the main opposition party in Scotland and no doubt feels a personal sense of responsibility to see them back in their box. With Richard Leonard in dficulty, there is now no effective opposition to the SNP in Holyrood.She will put indyref high on the agenda for the  Scottish elections, and use that as a lever to get a Section  from Westminster for a legally binding referendum, perhaps in  ,  years after the first independence referendum. That may seem a long way off for her more ardent troops, but in the great scheme of things it is a blink of an aye.There is speculation that she might not lead that independence campaign. A number of nationalist insiders believe the First Minister could resign following revelations in the forthcoming Alex Salmond court case. But I think it unlikely that Sturgeon will be going off to spend more time with her family any time soon.Therersquos just too much going on. Her number one enemy is gone, Johnson is staying and there is Brexit chaos all round. The SNP is riding high in the polls fully  years since the party came to office.

Youre asking me about a pig in a poke. And I will wait to see what legislation the opposition may try to bring forward.\"Mr Gove added: \"For me, the most important thing is to bear in mind actually, we already have legislation in place which an overwhelming majority of MPs voted for.\"We already have an EU Withdrawal Act, we already have the notice on Article , the process by which we leave the EU.\"But the comments drew a response of anger and dismay from political opponents.Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, described Mr Goversquos comments as ldquobreath-taking, and demanded the Prime Minister make a statement of clarication. ldquoNo Government is above the law, he declared.His Labour colleague, Jon Trickett, the Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: \"Boris Johnson has shown his contempt for our democracy and the British people. Any move to ignore an act of Parliament would be a full-blown attack on our constitution.\"It is staggering that in the same interview, Michael Gove admitted that the no-deal Brexit the Government is attempting to ram through will hit peoplersquos living standards with increased food prices.ldquoThis is a price that Boris Johnson is willing to pay because it wonrsquot be him and his wealthy friends paying it but ordinary families already struggling after nine years of austerity.Mr Trickett added: \"It is the people, not an unelected prime minister in hock to the vested interests of the richest, who should determine our countryrsquos future.\"Pete Wishart for the SNP said: \"The Tories are jumping up the dictatorial scale at an alarming rate, bounding from plans to suspend Parliament and now refusing to saythey will abide by the law. It is clear that this governmentrsquos gone rogue.ldquoHow anyone can have a shred of confidence in this hapless boorach is utterly astounding - no one is above the law, and for Boris Johnsonrsquos government to act like they are is genuinely terrying for our democracy,\" added the Perth MP.Guto Bebb, the former Conservative minister, said the Governmentrsquos ldquounprecedented willingness to flout the rules is a disgrace to our democracy.The Welsh backbencher went on: ldquoNot only are they suspending Parliament to try and force through a disastrous no-deal but now they are suggesting that, evenParliament passed a law requiring the Government to avoid no-deal, they might simply ignore it.ldquoOur very democracy is now under threat from Boris Johnson and his government, claimed Mr Bebb.He said Mr Gove had recently admitted that no-deal was not what he had campaigned for in  but that he was now ldquowilling to tear up our democratic system to force this outcome on the country against the wishes of both Parliament and the public.Mr Bebb, on behalf of the Peoplersquos Vote campaign, added: ldquoThe Brexiters in Government like to cloak themselves in the language of democracy but they willingly ignore basic democratic principles as and when it suits them.ldquoThe British people should not and will not stand for it. Its no wonder the outrage and protests across the UK are growing larger all the time. The British people believe in democracy and fair play and the only way to resolve the Brexit crisis is to give them the final say.Meanwhile, David Gauke, the former Justice Secretary and a leading Tory rebel, made clear he would be prepared to give up the Conservative whip to block a no-deal in the national interest.He told Skyrsquos Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ldquoIf it is the position now that defying the whip on a European vote is a matter that you lose the whip from the Conservative party, then there are quite a lot of Conservative MPs who over the recent months would have lost the whip.ldquoBut sometimes there is a point where you have to judge between your own personal interests and the national interest and the national interest has to come first. But I hope it doesnrsquot come to that. I hope cooler and calmer heads will look at this and think that trying to split the Conservative Party in this way is not a sensible way forward for the Conservative Party, or indeed for the country,\" he added.It has been suggested that as many as  Tory rebels are prepared to defy Mr Johnson and vote to block a no-deal outcome.On Monday, Mr Gauke and former Cabinet ministers are set to have their own private showdown with the PM in Downing St.\"I want to hear from him as to what is his plan to deliver a deal. When are we putting forward proposals to deal with this backstop issue  And I want to hear how he plans to deliver the legislationwe get a deal by October , because at the moment, frankly, I cant see how hes got time to do that,\" said Mr Gauke.Reports suggested that any Tory MP who defies the Government could see their candidacy withdrawn in the event of a snap general election. No  made clear ldquoall options for party management are under consideration.International Development Secretary Alok Sharma told Tory rebels to be \"clear whose side you are on\".In a warning to Conservative colleagues who are considering joining Opposition attempts to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit, Mr Sharma said they needed to \"stand with the people\" and deliver Brexit.Speaking to Sky News, Mr Sharma said: \"You need to be very clear whose side you are on.\"On Marr, Mr Gove was pressed on whether or not there would be shortages of fresh food as a result of a no-deal Brexit. He replied: \"Everyone will have the food they need,\" and then added: \"No, there will be no shortages of fresh food.\"Askedfood prices would increase, the Scot replied: \"There are a number of economic factors in play.

I guess it makes a change from hunting seals.Much like the Orcas, the pelagic men are the big beasts of the fishing industry, catching and landing large volumes of high-value fish in vessels that they have invested scores of millions of pounds in to keep them safe in wild winter seas that have of the type that the history books tell us thcclaimed the lives of too many fishermen.But they know full well that, just as the Orca is no more important than the sand eel in the ecosystem, this does not make them better than the inshore fisherman who lives next door and makes his living from shellfish or jigging for cod or mackerel.Equally, the guys who go to sea to catch the white fish ndash cod, haddock, monkfish, megrim, hake ndash that you buy in your fishmonger feel neither superior nor inferior.That is because the industry has its own ecosystem, with all the parts dependent on each other toharmoniously.In Shetland, it is possible to witness this in action on a daily basis.From my office window in Lerwick Harbour I can see vans from a range of dferent marine and electrical engineering companies parked next to whitefish vessels while repairs and servicing work are carried out on board.Those same companies, which provide highly skilled employment of the sort that keeps young people in our community and lay the foundations for a strong future, support the pelagic and inshore fleets.Take away any of these fleets and our vibrant engineering sector would be unsustainable.Similarly, without all of these fleets operating, the supply chain ndash fish markets, buyers processors and haulage firms on one side and net-makers, gear providers and wholesalers on the other ndash would be gravely weakened. Jobs would go, people would move away to find work, and the community would shrivel. You can see how it works.Furthermore, the leline ferry and freight services that we are currently encouraging the Scottish Government to enhance to match the volume of seafood being exported, would look a great deal dferent.To put this volume in context, more fish is landed in Shetland every year than in England, Wales and Northern Ireland combined.Beyond that, therersquos the specialist training of fishermen and marine scientic research provided by the NAFC Marine Centre in Scalloway, which is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, and the small-boat marinas and remote rural piers kept up by community organisations and the local authority.All are at risk from any upset to the delicate balance of the fisheries ecosystem.One of the more persistent and unhelpful myths about the fishing industry is that success in inshore fisheries ndash however measured ndash can come only at the expense of an offshore fleet.The many iants of this theme pitch ldquohaves against ldquohave-nots, ldquobig against ldquosmall and ldquolarge-scale or ldquoindustrial against ldquoartisanal.The main recommendation arising from this viewpoint is typically the reallocation of quota between dferent parts of the fishing fleet.This argument fails to acknowledge the complexity of the relationship between dferent fleet segments in places where inshore fisheries are successful, as I have outlined.Quota is only one factor behind the success or otherwise of inshore fisheries, and quotas already allocated to inshore fleets are often poorly utilised as it is.Some species cannot be caught economically, safely or in an environmentally responsible way except by large, modern boats capable of operating both close to shore and far offshore.Dividing the fishing industry into completely separate segments is not a helpful exercise.Our experience suggests that dferent classes of fishing vessels catching fish in dferent ways effectively combine to create a critical mass in onshore services, from engineering to sale, transport and marketing.This is particularly true of the more remote coastal and island fishing communities, where an inshore fleet of small boats may not be enough to sustain the onshore businesses crucial to successful operations.So, when we look at policy prescriptions to solve this or that ldquoproblem in the industry, we really need to see them in a much wider context, to understand the whole and not just the part or parts, and recognise that they are interdependent elements of an ecosystem that suffersradical surgery is carried out without consideration of the broader impact.Thatrsquos not another way of saying that the industry is resistant to change ndash in my experience the level of innovation, investment and re-investment in fisheries, often as a result of the need to adapt to new situations, whether enforced or naturally occurring, is remarkable.Rather, that when we consider how le in our coastal communities can be improved, we ought to reflect on how we can lt all boats and not just some.Simon Collins is Executive Officer of the Shetland Fishermenrsquos Association."},{"url":null,"title":"play-pie-pint-chic-murray-funny-place-window-review","story":"BBC Scotland, Sunday pm****EVERY now and then some TV writer tipsy on nostalgia calls for theof Play for Today.

We need to understandinvestors are being deterred because of the fear of nationalisation.Tory MSP Jamie Greene MSP said: ldquoNo one in their right mind thinks nationalisation is the answer to the Ferguson fiasco, and this damning indictment re-enforces that.ldquoIf SNP ministers think civil servants will run the yard better than a team of commercial shipbuilders then frankly theyrsquore wired to the moon. This madness must be stopped before the SNP welds the final rivet into the coffin of Scottish ship-building.A Government spokesperson said: ldquoThis action was about securing jobs and giving the yard a future - the alternative was to stand aside while the company went into administration.ldquoSuggestions we could simply have followed the steps taken in Canada, or other countries with vastly dferent rules and regulations on state aid, are ignorant and ill-informed.A CMAL spokesperson said: ldquoThe comments made by Davie shipyard are inaccurate, uninformed and demonstrate they have no knowledge of the situation.ldquoWe have always acted in line with our contractual obligations."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-matrix-ruths-decision-resign","story":"Scotland on SundayDani Garavelli lamented that Davidsonrsquos resignation means there is now one less role model for women at the top of politics.ldquoThough never one for female solidarity, she was part of a bright, new political landscape in which women were, at last, to the fore, she wrote. ldquoLike Kezia Dugdale, she has been pushed out by the political manoeuvrings of a man less able than she is and is likely to be replaced by the same.

But for many, ambition doesnrsquot die so much as evolve.

The Tories are promising the \"biggest, most generous spending review since the height of Tony Blairs New Labour\", with local councils in England expected to receive an extra pound. billion.:Marianne Taylor: Ruths replacement  Who cares when the Scottish Tories will push us off a no-deal clfAmid the Westminster chaos, Holyrood will struggle to get a look-in.But this week will also see the publication of the Scottish Governmentrsquos programme for government, with  new bills.This wonrsquot be a list of pre-election giveaways, with the First Minister stating that tackling inequality and climate changes will be at the heart of her programme. But the political rhetoric will focus on a Parliament \"getting on with the day job\" while Westminster literally prepares to shut down.The SNP is enjoying something of a purple patch, thanks in no small part to the actions of its opponents. Proroguing Parliament plays right into the Nationalistsrsquo hands. They say you should never interrupt your enemy when they are making mistakes.So it must be sorely tempting for Nicola Sturgeon to sit back and watch the chaos unfold, but as her former top adviser ndash the incomparable Kevin Pringle ndash said yesterday, the party must \"keep refreshing the policy agenda\".Few can realistically argue that the SNP hasnrsquot made progressive changes to Scotlandrsquos justice system, is working hard to tackle discrimination, and has been bold in addressing the climate crisis.But there is also no shortage of domestic challenges ahead.Education was famously billed by Ms Sturgeon as her main priority, yet there is a growing revolt over P tests, not to mention a major teacher recruitment shortage and low morale, and a failure to meet class-size targets.When Tony Blair made \"education, education, education\" his priority it led to the kind of transformational improvement that has not materialised under the SNP.This coming December the latest international comparison of performance in reading, maths and science will be published. It could be a pivotal moment for Nicola Sturgeon and her Education Secretary, John Swinney.In other policy fields, it remains to be seen whether Scottish voters are content to be told that their NHS is performing better than England, given the increasing pressures the health service is facing.The legal right patients have to be seen within  weeks has been broken , times in just a year.Operations are being cancelled because hospitals cannot cope, and a promise to end delayed discharge has still not been met.Scotlandrsquos health service needs money and resources that simply arenrsquot readily available.Tax revenues were almost pound billion less than expected for   and while Brexit is leading to economic trouble across the UK, Scotlandrsquos underlying performance remains weak despite a narrowing of its budget deficit.The financial problems wonrsquot make it any easier for ministers to achieve their signicant policy pledges set to be introduced in the months ahead.A doubling of the entitlement to early learning and childcare - from  hours to , hours - is due in August .But childcare expansion plans are missing forecasts by up to  per cent, with early learning expansion over , childcare places and more than  staff places behind schedule.Will councils be ready to deliver when the , hours entitlement comes into force \"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs oMvIrWF-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests oMvIrWF.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Gordon Brown warns no-deal Brexit threatens UK food supply chain with catastropheAnd what about the ban on household waste going to landfill that will be enforced a few months later The likelihood is it will simply lead to an increase in exporting waste to England and where, with the associated financial and environmental costs.But what may cause the biggest headache for ministers is the continued transfer of welfare powers to Holyrood.There are already delays to the full roll-out until the middle of the next Parliament ndash nearly a decade after the Smith Commission made its post-referendum recommendations.Further delays have been pencilled in for disabled pensioner benefits and carers, and observers expect a further delay in at least one other area will be announced.This autumn, the Fiscal Commission will start to give forecasts on expenditure for benefits being delivered right up to the  election.It will show for the first time the full impact of social security devolution, and the pressure of increasing caseloads, on the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget.The current \"fiscal framework\" agreed in the wake of the Smith Commission devolution settlement is due to be looked at, so at some point there will have to be negotiations with the UK Government about the next deal. Last time it took months to break the deadlock and the Boris Johnson administration may well drive a harder bargain than George Osborne did.That would play right into the SNPrsquos hands in terms of political rhetoric, but an unseemly standoff wonrsquot help those relying on welfare payments.Ahead of the  General Election, a major crisis in the Scottish Governmentrsquos IT system left thousands of farmers without their farm subsidy payments, contributing to Tory gains in some rural areas.Imagine the backlashthere are similar problems with the delivery of welfare payments.These impending challenges are not necessarily all of the SNPrsquos own making. But the Nationalists have torn up the rule book which states that the party of government is the one held responsible by voters.Thatrsquos what always having someone  to blame can achieve, regardless of the truth, and right now their opponents are making it easy for them.Scottish Labour is a shadow of its former self, the Scottish Tories have lost their star, UK Labour is battling with the LibDems for a distant second place in the polls, and the UK Tories are demolishing democracy.The SNPrsquos ability to navigate choppy waters ahead will depend not only on what it does in government, but whether its opponents can rise to the challenge.There are testing times ahead for every political party."},{"url":null,"title":"hurricane-dorian-strikes-bahamas-record-winds-evacuations-ordered-us","story":"The stormrsquos top sustained winds decreased slightly to mph as its westward movement slowed, crawling along Grand Bahama island early on Monday at mph in what forecasters said would be a day-long assault.Earlier, Dorian churned over Abaco island with battering winds and surf.There was little information from the affected islands, but officials expected many residents to be left homeless.:Comedian Kevin Hart injured in car crashMost people went to shelters as the storm approached, with tourist hotels shutting down and residents boarding up their homes.ldquoItrsquos devastating, said Joy Jibrilu, director general of the Bahamasrsquo Ministry of Tourism and Aviation. ldquoThere has been huge damage to property and infrastructure.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Local charity the Blide Trust put a lot of work into ensuring the gardens are kept up to a high standard and are a peaceful and welcoming place to relax and rewind in.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the midst of some of Scotland’s most breathtakingly beautul scenery, amongst communities who are closer geographically to Oslo than to London, I was in constant communication with colleagues about how we protect the very democratic process being played out around me.It seemed that even here there was no escape from the flag waving, nationalism which has plunged us into this mess.And I don’t just mean Boris Johnson and his brand of Brexiteers.One of the first things that hit me on my arrival were the flags.Everywhere.I’ve often been to the Northern Isles before and I know how proud the communities in both Orkney and Shetland rightly are of their inidual colours. But this was dferent. This was not the islanders.This was a political party wrapping itself in local symbolism for its own ends. It was on their cars, posters and leaflets.For me over the past week the attempted appropriation of the flag of Shetland by the SNP has yelled out as a metaphor for the nationalist introversion which is threatening to shut down our democracy.The currency of modern Scottish politics seems to be that you have to choose which flag in which to wrap yourself. Saltire or Union To which identity are you going to confine yourself Charles Kennedy, as in so much about our politics, had the answer.Whenever he was asked he insisted that he was a Highlander, a Scot, British and a European, and that each layer of that identity was equally valuable to him.They reinforce each other and make the inidual at their heart stronger. This week, on my phone in the centre of Lerwick, being brought up to date on the national crisis, surrounded by the paraphernalia of Scottish nationalism, I felt yet again, that the fabric of my interwoven identities was under threat.It has been constant since .But this time it’s not just my identity but our democratic traditions too.The liberalism, tolerance and adherence to constitutional precedent which we have lived by for centuries is being challenged at the centre.The announcement that parliament will be suspended, our democracy is being shut down to allow the UK Government to choose how and when we leave the EU, deal or no deal, without scrutiny shook me to the core.As a history and politics undergraduate at Glasgow University I often wondered how contemporary MPs reflected on their role in issues of their time like Suez, the Suffragettes or the miners’ strike.Now I am finding out for myself.Even as the tiniest cog in that vast machinery of  elected members that is the House of Commons, I am aware of my responsibility.I have spent much of this week talking to others, reaching out to dferent parties, supporting those trying to build a consensus.And just as we thought we were getting our heads around the implications of this authoritarian power grab, there was another surprise.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, a woman who has taken her party from threatened obscurity to challenging for power at Holyrood is taking a step back.The loss of that one inidual’s input seems, right now, at this critical moment, huge.What will happen next to her party, and how her  MPs at Westminster will respond to their leader shutting down parliament, is for others to decide.For many people it must seems that it is yet more evidence of crumbling foundations.I am not one of them.This week has undoubtedly been one of the most tumultuous and tortuous in modern British political history.The next few weeks promise to bring even more drama, power plays and stress.But at the centre of it all the people on Shetland did the one thing which, in the final analysis, may provide that answer we are all looking for.They went out and voted in astonishing numbers to decide which person had the confidence of the greatest number of islanders to be their representative.While others argued about democratic rights, they exercised theirs.The majority turned their back on the flag-waving, populism and identity politics.They chose Beatrice Wishart of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The flag of Shetland belongs to all the islanders in the same way as the Saltire represents each and every political expression in Scotland, every locality and every inidual.It is my flag and yours.But it is also not all that we are.It should unite us.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eu ready for more brexit talks but uk needs new backstop plan simon coveney","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That’s not going to fly and I think it’s important that we are all honest about that.“We have always saidthere are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let’s hear them andwe can work out a deal on that basis, so be it.“But what we will not do in Ireland, and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this, we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed – i.e. the backstop, which solves a dficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis – and for that to be replaced with something that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we’ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how.“That is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"julian smith called back from irish border for cabinet meeting","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chancellor Sajid Javid will deliver his first spending review on Wednesday but this could easily be lost in the chatter about Brexit and the suspension of the House.The amount of time on the hands of MPs looking to block a no-deal Brexit in October has been curtailed, so the number of options at their disposal is limited.A vote of no confidence is among them, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying it was “on the table”.

We have put forward reasonable proposals and the PM and his team have been discussing these with EU leaders and theCommission over the summer recess.“It would be entirely unreasonable for MPs – having rejected the previous deal three times – to attempt to bind the hands of the Prime Minister as he seeks to negotiate a deal they can support ahead of EU Council in October.”Earlier, Mr Johnson was accused of “goading” some Tory MPs to rebel so he can force a snap general election having purged opponents of a no-deal Brexit from the party.David Gauke, the former justice secretary and rebel ringleader, accused the Prime Minister of deliberately trying to lose votes to block a deal-less departure this week.Mr Gauke, head of the so-called “Gaukeward squad” of Tory rebels, said the Prime Minister’s move was an “unusual” and “particularly confrontational” approach.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme he has not been subject to the usual “cajoling” from Cabinet allies to urge him to support the Government’s line.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “I think they seem to be quite prepared for there to be a rebellion, then to purge those who support the rebellion from the party,” he said.Mr Gauke said he has taken the extraordinary move of writing to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Lord Chancellor Robert Buckland, asking them to confirm whether the Government believes in the rule of law.The backbencher’s letter came after Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal planning, refused to confirm whether ministers would abide by any measure passed by Parliament.Meanwhile, Mr Hammond has written to the PM asking him to set out details of his plan to renegotiate the Brexit deal with Brussels in an apparent attempt to get Mr Johnson to show whether he is serious about avoiding a no-deal exit.In a sign of Cabinet unease about the tough stance being taken by Mr Johnson, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said: “I have made my views clear to the Prime Minister that we should not be a party that is trying to remove from our party two former chancellors, a number of ex-cabinet ministers, that the way to hold our party together and to get a deal is to bring them onside and explain to them what we’re trying to do and why.”She told the Spectator’s Women With Balls podcast she questioned whether it was fair to take such action given that previous rebels who opposed Theresa May’s deal – including Mr Johnson – kept the whip“I’m really urging the Government to think very carefully about taking such a dramatic step,” she said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who called a meeting of his shadow cabinet in Salford to discuss tactics, said: “First we must come together to stop no-deal – this week could be our last chance.“We are working with other parties to do everything necessary to pull our country back from the brink. Then we need a general election.”Former prime minister Tony Blair used a speech in London to urge Labour not to support any push by Downing Street for an early general election, but demand a Brexit referendum instead."},{"url":null,"title":"man admits intentionally driving digger into travelodge","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"excellent results ysgol bro hyddgen machynlleth","story":"Ysgol Bro Hyddgen pupils Mari Elin Williams– one A*, seven As, two Bs ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtand one C with Ella ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtPreston – five As and eight Bs.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Excellent results at Bro HyddgenYsgol Bro Hyddgen pupil Lily Shone – one A*, five As and six Bs.\" Excellent results at Bro HyddgenYsgol Bro Hyddgen pupil Josephn Lewis - four A*s, five As, two B, Merit in Extraltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Maths.lt spangtlt spangt\" Excellent results at Bro HyddgenYsgol Bro Hyddgen pupil Ffion Duke – two A*s, three As, six Bs, one C, Merit iltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtn Extra Maths.lt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"pictures 39 wall wall sunshine 39","story":"Berriew Show President and grandfather, Mark Bright, presents cup winner in the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtover s fancy dress ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtto Olivia Jonesfrom Berriew.

This will ensure that this important local landmark will be secure for generations to come and visitors to the town can continue to enjoy it as a back.The parishrsquos project convenor, Dennis Constable said: ldquoThis repair work will ensure that people will still be able to visit the church and enjoy looking at the heritage and the wonderful stained glass windows.ldquoThe church also holds many treasures of history that stretch back in Newcastlersquos history and which are relevant to many people.He added: ldquoThe repairs, which include the bell tower  will provide for the church bells, which have been silent for so long, to once again to be rung..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28th August 2019 Border.jpg","title":"Border Cup set to start  ","story":"CUP action continues to dominate the local soccer scene with the countdown to Christmas joy beginning on Saturday.Thatrsquos when the first round of the prestigious Border Cup takes place with eight local teams in action.Top billing goes to the game at Robert Adams Park between Kilmore Rec and Portaferry.Other ties include Grove United v Killyleagh YC, Drumaness Mills v Greenisland, Holywood FC v Ballynahinch Olympic, Aquinas v Ballynahinch United, Comber Rec v Bangor Swts and Saintfield United v Bryansburn Rangers.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline.

Housing Executive workmen carried out repairs, but seven months ago the fireplace again broke up. Since then repeated calls to the Executive met with little or no response.ldquoWith winter fast coming we needed this fireplace fixed, said Mr Terry McGrory. ldquoDuring the summer months we managed to make do, but therersquos no way we could face cold nights without a fire in our living room.ldquoSince February wersquove had to do without a fire and it was beginning to look like it wouldnrsquot be fixed at all.

housing conference to take place to address the social housing crisis.At the time, it was revealed that Newcastle was a social housing need hot spot with  people on the waiting list for new homes

houses that do come on the market snapped up by people for use as holiday homes.Councillors say they are keen for all ious stakeholders collaborating to provide short, medium and long term solutions to tackle the crisis.In addition, they are keen to see a focus on building appropriate housing for the changing needs of the district, including the increasing demand for single occupancy dwellings

from the town for a day in Newcastle which to some excited children at the time seemed like a million miles away when in reality it was literally only up the road.New shoes and clothes were purchased ahead of the annual excursion so everyone was looking their best, with families gathering at the St Dillonrsquos Avenue sports pitches before marching to the townrsquos bus station via Edward Street, John Street, Irish Street and Market Street.A fun-filled day was spent in Newcastle, when the summers always felt warmer than they are today, with families ing home by bus, exhausted after a frantic

Model Farm and Flying Horse areas.A number of cars were again pelted with stones as they drove along the Killough Road, while several fires were also started on Saturday evening.On Sunday, part of the Brannish Road was reported to be barricaded with branches and supermarket trolleys with young people targeting passing cars with stones.The most disturbing incident occurred on Monday evening when a woman driving alone was left frightened after her car was stoned on the Brannish Road as she made her way to work.Police have confirmed that they are aware of the recent trouble and warned those responsible for the unruly behaviour that their involvement could lead to a criminal record and harm their future university and employment prospects.Officers have also appealed to anyone who can assist them with their enquiries to contact them as they work to apprehend those responsible for the trouble.The Flying Horse Ward Community Forum mdash which earlier this year organised a public protest to call for an end to trouble at this part of the town mdash has condemned the weekend incidents.The grouprsquos chairwoman, Lisa Perry, said the continuing trouble was ldquosimply not acceptable and must end. She also appealed to parents to know where their children are and what they are doing.Ms Perry said children need to be taught to respect the community where they live, the people of the Model Farm and Flying Horse areas and those who commute along the Killough Road.ldquoResidents and those who use the Killough Road should not have to put up with such behaviour and anyone who knows who is responsible should contact the police, she said.Ms Perry said the message must go out that stoning cars is not acceptable and that those responsible will not be be allowed to get away with what they are doing.ldquoIt does not bear thinking about what would happena driver whose car is stoned loses control of the vehicle and crashes into pedestrians or someonersquos home. Those who throw missiles at cars need to realise the potential consequences of what they are doing. For drivers, this is a terribly frightening experience.Angry residents have also taken to social media to voice their concern about the trouble which has been prevalent at this part of Downpatrick for many years.Parents have also been urged to warn their children not to get involved in behaviour which could lead to serious consequences, with residents branding those responsible for the trouble as ldquodisgraceful. They said their parents should be doing more to stop the unruly behaviour, expressing concern that the trouble has been allowed to continue for too long and must be stopped.ldquoThe trouble is too frequent, said one woman, while a man revealed his van was stoned on two occasions at the Killough Road last month. Worryingly, he reported that children as young as  were responsible.Another resident expressed concern that a driver could lose control of their car after being stoned which could result in a crash and someone being seriously injured.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said local police must respond swtly to the anti-social behaviour, especially after Monday nightrsquos incident when a woman was attacked.ldquoThere has been an escalation of the anti-social behaviour in the Flying Horse and Model Farm area from a number of youths. Cars have been stoned, fires started and people assaulted. This behaviour is unacceptable, he declared.ldquoThe perceived inactivity of the authorities cannot be allowed to send a message that such behaviour is acceptable.

We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College. The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.The Mid Sussex streets

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to ..

Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee.

Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
