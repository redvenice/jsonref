Much of that observation inevitably centred on the pub. “The landlord was quite crazy,” Parr recalls, “and he is being set upon here by a member of the Chew Stoke women’s rugby team, who also tended to be quite boisterous.” The photographer had got to know the people well enough by then for them almost to forget his camera was there.Even so, capturing the confined chaos of the very English bacchanal, was hit and miss. “When you take photographs on these kinds of occasions,” Parr says, “it is very difficult to distil everything into a single picture. Sometimes you think you have got it, and then you look at the picture the next day and realise you missed the atmosphere. You’re looking for the moment where it all comes to a head.”All photos change with time, but he suspects something like this scene will be replicated again this New Year’s Eve “when everything tends to become more itself”. He lives not far away in Bristol and drives through Chew Stoke from time to time. “I opened the agricultural show one year,” he says. “The pub is still going strong, the shop keeps changing hands,” but mostly it is what it was. The village represents one strand of Parr’s principal life’s work, which is to capture a sense of Englishness. “It’s my number one subject,” he says, “and in our ided country, the search continues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ff3d07d25d8988833334c367fb9522ae4eb8f3/617_1241_3517_2110/master/3517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b191db06547f889d4d97caa299411ac","title":"bestselling books 2019","story":"This year’s UK charts saw domestic cleaning overtake domestic noir, and women winning all the top spots in literary fictionAlmost every other year in the 2010s, an author has come out of left field and claimed the annual bestsellers’ top spot at the expense of the perennial contenders. It is either a first-time novelist going straight to No 1 (Gail Honeyman with Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine last year, EL James with all her Fifty Shades trilogy in 2012), or a former mega-seller returning with a new take on their old saga (James’s reverse-angle Grey in 2015, JK Rowling and her co-writers’ script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in 2016).This happened again in 2019, but with a double twist: a non-fiction title with two debut authors. Pinch of Nom by Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson, a pair of weight-watching food bloggers from the Wirral, was always a favourite for supremacy after it broke records in March for first-week sales. The spin-off Food Planner also makes the top 50, and the pair are bound to get a third title well up the chart by the end of the year as their follow-up, Pinch of Nom: Everyday Light, came out on 12 December.Their success reflects a reconfiguration of the domestic sector, with a falling away of celebrity chefs’ recipe books (Jamie Oliver’s Veg is the sole survivor at No 9) and the rise of offerings centred on weight loss or fitness, including Michael Mosley’s The Fast 800 (23) and titles just outside the chart by Joe Wicks and Tom Kerridge. Books about housework or home organisation are on the rise too, as shown by the remarkable sales for two books (5, 17) by Mrs Hinch – Sophie Hinchcliffe – promising to “shine your sink and soothe your soul”. Published a fortnight apart in the spring, Pinch of Nom and Hinch Yourself Happy both owe much to their authors’ social media presence – Mrs Hinch has an eye-popping 2.9 million followers on Instagram.Also mingling in the chart’s elite with the usual suspects – Oliver, David Walliams, Lee Child, Jeff Kinney – are representatives of another trend, the insider memoirs of people in stressful jobs: Adam Kay (6, 15) and Christie Watson (47) on hospital medicine, the Secret Barrister (25) on the law, Ant Middleton (19) on the army, and Peter Crouch (on the chart’s subs’ bench at 62) on football. Tellingly, the most popular examples of “job lit” outsold the top new celebrity memoirs – Elton John’s Me (38), Billy Connolly’s Tall Tales (43) – in a defeat of the famous by the non-famous that mirrors Pinch of Nom’s triumph in cookbooks.The heftier, more scholarly end of the factual spectrum, by contrast, continued to flounder commercially. If Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens (50) – one of only two translated works in the list – were not still hanging on five years after publication, Bill Bryson’s The Body (39) would be the lone standard bearer for the kind of non-fiction that wins prizes.In fiction, meanwhile, a peculiar ision is discernible in the top 50, whereby all the chart’s crime novels are by men – an indication of the waning of the largely female-driven psychological thriller – and, perhaps more surprisingly, children’s fiction (from Philip Pullman to Walliams’s five titles to picture books) is a male preserve too. Conversely, no books classified as “general and literary fiction” are written by men, and the range of work by women is striking: Heather Morris’s hugely popular historical novel (2), more BDSM sex from James (31), smart commercial fiction by Liane Moriarty, Jojo Moyes and Sophie Kinsella (7, 10, 40), Eleanor Oliphant still doing more than fine in paperback (14), and the award-winning literary novelists Sally Rooney, Kate Atkinson and Madeline Miller (13, 41, 49).Plus, of course, the joint 2019 Booker winner Margaret Atwood, who scored with both the TV tie-in edition of The Handmaid’s Tale (37) and its victorious sequel. The Testaments (12) is the highest placed (adult) novel published this year and has quite possibly racked up the biggest sales ever by a winner in hardback, with 272,251 copies sold so far.Among other reasons to be cheerful are the performances of writers who, like the chart-topping double act, were little known a year ago. These include self-styled “grubby artist” Charlie Mackesy, whose sleeper hit The Boy, The Mole, the Fox and the Horse (20) took the Waterstones prize, memoirist Raynor Winn (35) and Greta Thunberg (32).

The former auto executive has French and Lebanese citizenship and was born in Brazil.Junichiro Hironaka said he had not spoken to Ghosn since last week and that he was “surprised” by his client’s arrival in Lebanon.

It is also a serious problem that Japan’s system allowed an illegal departure so easily.”The Tokyo prosecutor’s office had no comment when contacted about Ghosn and a Nissan spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Lebanese embassy in Tokyo said: “We did not receive any information.”Agnes Pannier-Runacher, a junior minister in the French government, said she was “very surprised” by Ghosn’s flight to Lebanon. She told France Inter radio that no one was above the law but Ghosn would be able to get French consular support.Ghosn, 65, who rescued Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago and masterminded a successful alliance with Renault, was arrested in November 2018 shortly after arriving in Japan on his private jet. He faces four charges, including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.He has consistently denied the charges and spent more than 120 days in detention before being released on bail for a second time in late April. His treatment drew international criticism and claims that prosecutors were subjecting him to “inhuman” treatment.Japan’s justice system has been criticised at home and abroad during Ghosn’s detention for provisions that allow suspects to be held for long periods. One of the reasons used to justify his detention before he was allowed out on bail was that he was considered a flight risk.Ghosn’s bail conditions required him to surrender his passport and remain at a court-designated house in Tokyo preparing for his trial, which was expected to begin in April. He was forbidden from seeing his Lebanese-born wife, Carole Nahas, without special permission, and had limited internet access.Ghosn said in a video message in April that he had been unfairly portrayed by “backstabbing” Nissan executives as “a personage of greed and a personage of dictatorship”.He said he had been the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former colleagues of targeting him in an attempt to derail a closer alliance between Nissan and Renault."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e66e53cbb7a583c5ca65d3e7e742577686323b5/1_0_3436_2061/master/3436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=750eecebf8798464830a8b6984c6e3fd","title":"tsb staff sacked over gaming of customer compensation system","story":"Exclusive: Union criticises bank inquiry into IT meltdown payouts that led to five workers being dismissedTSB staff whose own bank accounts were affected by an IT meltdown have been sacked for allegedly gaming the compensation system set up to help customers affected by the debacle. understands that compensation claims lodged by a number of TSB workers after the IT collapse in April 2018 were re-assessed this year by TSB for signs that they may have used inside information to get the largest possible payout.About 40-50 workers were initially identified by the bank over their claims earlier this year, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. Further investigation led to formal internal proceedings against about eight staff during the summer, five of whom were eventually sacked. Others resigned before a formal decision could be made.TSB inadvertently locked up to 1.9 million customers out of their accounts during the IT fiasco, which occurred when it tried to migrate customers from TSB’s former owner, Lloyds Banking Group, on to a new system.A TSB spokesperson said: “We responded to all migration customer complaints from staff members. A very small number of complaints were found to be dishonest and appropriate action was taken.”No criminal proceedings were launched as a result of the alleged wrongdoing.Letters sent during the formal investigation of the eight employees accused them of having “failed to act with integrity” by logging false or exaggerated claims. It claimed the employees in question ended up securing compensation money that was intended for customers who were “genuinely impacted by migration issues”.TSB has been working hard to restore its reputation and avoid any further missteps after the botched migration of customer accounts. The IT chaos led to the eventual ousting of chief executive Paul Pester.Most lenders encourage staff to hold bank accounts with their employer, meaning that many of TSB’s near-8,500 staff at the time may have been affected.  has been told that some staff were discouraged by managers from lodging complaints to overwhelmed call centres, though this was not an official policy from the bank and many employees went on to file inidual claims.The bank was forced to hire 600 extra staff to handle a total of 184,000 complaints, and drew up a framework to determine the amount of compensation it would pay for distress and inconvenience.The rubric considered at least 10 categories that helped to measure the type of disruption the customer faced, including how long the customer was chasing the bank about the issue, whether their credit scores were affected and whether they had become victims of fraud as a result.Based on those answers, TSB would decide whether claimants experienced “minor” to “significant” inconvenience, resulting in compensation from as little as £100 – £50 each for distress and additional expenses – or as much as £500 plus additional expenses. TSB ended up spending around £130m on compensation claims.It is possible that some staff were simply aware of the kind of information required to lodge a claim as efficiently as possible. However, the bank claimed that some staff were unfairly using this rubric to try to obtain the largest possible payout.The letter said the accused staff failed to provide evidence backing their claims and accused employees of breaching TSB’s code of conduct.One trade union that represents TSB employees, Affinity, flagged the original review of employee compensation claims in a member newsletter in May, calling it a “witch hunt” against staff who had the right to complain. “Let’s be clear, TSB staff who are also customers of the bank have the same rights as other customers and their complaints should be treated in exactly the same way,” the union said.Unite, another union representing TSB employees, said none of its members was disciplined as a result of the sanctions. However, it also raised concerns about the way staff were being disciplined for actions they took as customers of the bank.Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: “I think it’s better to view the customer relationship as completely separate from the employer relationship, unless dealing with clear instances of fraudulent activity.”Last month, an independent report commissioned by the bank accused TSB’s board of directors of lacking “common sense” before the 2018 IT meltdown. The investigation, carried out by law firm Slaughter and May, found the bank failed to ask its contractor key questions before the launch, and then shifted customers to the new IT platform before it had been fully tested.TSB chairman Richard Meddings apologised for the disruption but said he did not agree with all of the report’s findings. He said technical issues were at the heart of the failure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa25318001af8a223449dffb9345e4de67b4df4/0_107_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17845e7f27ef83a6ca16ecd0c9519a1b","title":"universal music sells stake to chinese giant tencent","story":"Vivendi said Tencent Music Entertainment will also buy a minority stake in Universal Music’s operation across China.“Vivendi is very happy with the arrival of Tencent and its co-investors,” Vivendi said in a statement. “They will enable UMG to further develop in the Asian market.”Vivendi and Tencent would not name other members of the consortium other than to say it includes “certain global financial investors”.Separately, Vivendi said it entered new talks just before Christmas over the potential sale of an additional minority stake in UMG, at a price “which would at least be identical” to the deal with Tencent, with another unnamed investor or investors.The French media conglomerate has been angling to sell a stake in UMG for the last 18 months to cash in on the music industry revival which is being driven by the streaming revolution, in turn led by services including Apple, Spotify, Amazon and Deezer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891baeb2adbad14056145b603396a1d7d6f23af4/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b07b8a51db6a76cdc1e791e40f69074","title":"global markets rally shares ftse 100 pound oil markets business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news on the final trading day of 2019Newsflash: Britain’s stock market has just posted its best annual performance in three years, despite stumbling over the line today.Trading was very light today, with many investors already wrapped up for the year. There have also been signs of profit-taking in recent days, after global markets enjoyed their best year in a decade.David Madden of CMC Markets says the construction industry should benefit from the resolution of the Brexit crisis, although there are still uncertainties ahead:The solid win by the Conservative party in the recent general election helped drive up the share price of the house builders, but there has been a new development on the Brexit front. Judging by the plans Prime Minister Johnson has, a no-deal Brexit after the transition period at the end of 2020 might be an option, so uncertainty could continue to hang over the housing industry in 2020.There has been a belief in certain sections of the City that investment has been delayed because of Brexit, so we could see more of that. On the plus slide for the housing market, the Bank of England are unlikely to hike rates until Brexit has been wrapped up.Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says markets have flourished in 2019 -- and they could keep shining in 2020.Markets have also been very calm and stock market volatility as measured by the S\u0026ampP VIX has been remarkably low for most of 2019.Back in the markets, sterling is enjoying a late rally.The pound has gained three-quarters of a cent to $1.319 against the US dollar, a two-week high.That’s dragging down multinational stocks in London, shaving 42 points off the FTSE 100 today.What a difference a year makes. But 2019 has been much brighter. The Shanghai and Shenzen markets have clawed back all those losses, rallying by a third this year.Last year’s plunge forced policymakers to act -- by easing monetary policy and raising government spending. The deepening trade dispute with America also forced policymakers to halt efforts to deleverage the economy, and focus on propping up growth. Zhou Longgang, an analyst with Huachuang Securities, says:“The sharp correction in 2018 pushed valuations of China stocks to record lows, prompting a recovery in 2019, as Beijing rolled out supportive measures to boost the economy.”You can get up to speed on the Ghosn Getaway with this profile:Plus our latest news story on his escape:The most astonishing business story of the day, and for several months, is Carlos Ghosn’s remarkable escape from Japanese authorities.Last night, the former boss of Renault-Nissan popped up in Beirut - a major surprise, as he was under strict controls in Tokyo facing financial misconduct charges.Ghosn, who has denied defrauding the car giant, says he has “escaped injustice”. In a stern statement, he accusing the Japanese system of assuming guilt and being rigged against him, with a trial expected to start next year.“I have not fled justice – I have escaped injustice and political persecution.”But how did Ghosn leave Japan, given he had surrendered all his passports? He was also being tracked by police, having been charged with understating his salary and transferring $5m of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest. One theory, worthy of a Hollywood film, is that he made his getaway in a musical instrument case! The theory is that a group of ‘musicians’ turned up at the Ghosn residence in Tokyo for a performance, and left with the former auto magnate crammed into one of their boxes.....China’s stock market has closed for 2019, after a very strong year.That’s quite surprising, given the damage caused to China’s economy by the US trade war.But policymakers have responded to slowing growth by pledging new stimulus measures, cutting borrowing costs and trying to boost infrastructure spending. This has lifted markets, meaning China’s shares have grown faster than Wall Street this year (and a lot faster than the UK market).Having enjoyed such a strong year, the markets appear to be taking an end-of-term breather.That doesn’t dent this year’s rally, and is probably due to profit-taking. But it also reflects some caution about next year.You might expect some relief that the Phase One trade deal between Washington and Beijing will be signed shortly.But, investors are now wondering when Phase Two will ever be reached, as Stephen Innes of AxiTrader explains:While market volumes are predictably light, investors continue to strike a year-end cautionary tone as December optimism is gradually giving way to 2020’s uncertainty. This despite “Trump’s trade deal in the bag,” according to the President’s hawkish trade adviser Peter Navarro.Sure, the worst-case of a tariff escalation scenario has been seemingly averted. But, once the P1 deal is signed, investors will then press to consider the P2 risks, after all how much more progress can be realistically expected ahead of the US elections next year.Global tech stocks have had a stunning year.The rise in world stock prices this year has been quite remarkable, as this chart shows:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.It’s the final trading day of 2019, and what a year it has been! Investors around the world are toasting the best 12 months since the financial crisis, following strong gains in equities around the globe.Starting January at 456 points, it is ending December at 564 points, having hit a record high last week.We’ve seen record highs on Wall Street, while European stocks touched their highest levels since 2015.Shares have been lifted by central bankers, who stepped in (again) with easy money to support the markets. US interest rate cuts, and fresh monetary stimulus in the eurozone, lifted asset prices.Optimism that America’s economy will avoid a recession, and that the US-China trade war will be resolved, also pushed markets higher.Depending how Brexit plays out, some analysts predict London’s market will rally in 2020.As John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, puts it:The ingredients are there for the FTSE 100 to hit a new high.

It was the child of neoliberal policies, sketched by economists like Milton Friedman and rolled out by leaders like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. A long wave of deregulation eventually gave rise to a financial tsunami, which put the system on the verge of collapse. In a few weeks during the autumn of 2008, money flows froze, paralysing trade and investment internationally, which trickled down to erode workers’ wages and employment conditions. The unfolding of events comforted the left’s ideological worldview. But it’s clear as day that the left’s politics did not prevail.In the first half of the 2010s, the tide was rising for progressive forces. The victory of Syriza in Greece, the surge of Podemos in Spain and the presidential campaign of Jean-Luc Mélenchon in France made it possible to believe that the future belonged to the left.Where did this resurgence come from? After a brief Keynesian interlude of vigorous budgetary stimulus to stop the spiralling depression, European politicians returned to austerity policies. In June 2010, Olli Rehn, then European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, argued that, “No one can live beyond their means for ever – not even governments.” In fact, if a depression is looming, governments can and should “live beyond their means”. And central banks must make cash readily available to evade the cascade of failures. No one other than public authorities can do that.The return to austerity unleashed a second slump in the region, which soon threatened to engulf the euro itself. It was met in the street with a wave of social unrest not seen for half a century on the western part of the continent. Protests spread in Spain and Greece with massive occupations of public squares and strikes. The spirit of resistance spread to the political realm, with a dramatic retreat of austerity-leaning centre-left parties and the rise of new, more radical organisations.If there’s a single moment that characterises the end of this moment, it’s the tragic Greek betrayal of July 2015. In this deadly summer, the Greek people voted against (“oxi”) the bailout conditions imposed by the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF. But this victory was transformed by Syriza – the only left-of-social-democracy government in Europe – into a humiliating submission. When then prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accepted harsher structural reforms to keep Greece’s membership of the eurozone, he proved that democracy could be blackmailed. Capital, not people, has the last say.What to do with Europe? What to do with globalisation? These questions that have haunted the left for decades are still unanswered. Since the François Mitterrand “austerity turn” in 1983 – when France’s socialist government decided to abandon its economic policy to preserve the linking of the franc to the European Monetary System – up to the recent defeat of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, the European question has been poison. This is because it ides the left down the middle. On the one hand, there is an internationalist aspiration for more European integration to confront capitalism and pool resources to build a common wealth on the other hand, any attempt to implement meaningful changes requires a rupture with the neoliberal orthodoxy embedded in European institutions. Add to this the fact that much of the working-class base has a deep hostility to the EU, and there is a wide and visible political breach in the left – of which the nationalist right of Boris Johnson and Marine Le Pen has taken advantage.In governing circles, unconventional monetary policies have now become the new normal, to the point where the possibility of financial crisis has virtually disappeared: whenever some fragility emerges, it is eased by emergency provision of vast sums of liquidity. Facing another European slowdown, Mario Draghi closed his presidency at ECB with a new round of quantitative easing. And just before Christmas, the US Federal Reserve launched an additional $57bn to ease tension in the markets. The wounds inherited from the global financial crisis still cut deep in working-class people’s lives, but there is no shortage of money to support the transatlantic financial system.At the same time, the intellectual case for austerity has been killed by a decade of stagnation. Christine Lagarde, the IMF and Emmanuel Macron have called for the abandoning of a budgetary orthodoxy that “belongs in the past century”. Even in Germany, a widening spectrum of politicians and businesses wants to relinquish the policy of zero government deficits to modernise infrastructure and revive business-friendly industrial policy.There is a cruel paradox here. Left-leaning economists were right when they argued in the early 2010s that markets do not look after themselves. But this insight was taken on board by elites to protect the system rather than transform it. Policymaking was reshaped so that the full economic might of the state was mobilised to stabilise the financial wealth of the richest. Over the past 10 years, those with financial assets have seen their wealth increase as stock markets boosted on quantitative easing steroids, while rightwing leaders like Johnson as well as mainstream European policymakers are now happy to contemplate industrial policies and increased public spending. And the left has been deprived of a crucial argument.For sure, there are still plenty of other areas where the left is the most compelling voice – on the climate crisis, inequality and confronting the rise of new digital feudalism as tech giants tower over the economy. But the harsh lessons of the 2010s is that it is not enough to be a critic. Without a strategy tempered in the complicated realities of class politics and a clear conception of how the state can confront global corporations and the institutions that protect them, there will be no victory for the left in the 21st century.• Cédric Durand teaches economics and development theories at the University of Paris 13"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77bf4875628d5fb6e6468e457b1e43f57d480d0f/0_189_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44b08828b5ca077951efda3959255742","title":"new years eve day times square new york","story":"New Year’s Day, I will wake up refreshed. And while you’re passed out hungover, I will steal the money from your pocketsRejoice, for we are approaching a joyous and special time: New Year’s Eve, the day that offers you the very best chance of passing out drunkenly and freezing to death in a snowdrift.The best holiday is Christmas, or the appropriate cultural equivalent. It has fun traditions. It has lots of candy. And you get presents. Christmas is perhaps the only holiday that lives up to the weeks-long anticipatory buildup forced upon us by capitalism. Situated, as it is, at the end of the year, Christmas is a convenient time for us to reflect on what we have done in the past year, and contemplate what we wish to do next. Sitting cozily by the fire with a cup of hot chocolate and a pile of gifts, we absorb good cheer, making it more likely that we will decide to be nice to people in the year to come. I understand that some of you hate your families and therefore despise Christmas – but that’s a personal problem. You can’t blame Santa for that. If you were seeking to design the perfect holiday from scratch, Christmas checks all the boxes.Then, mere days later, as we’re still basking in the warm afterglow of generosity and peace, New Year’s Eve bursts in like a party guest who arrives after everyone else has left and demands that you turn up the music again. Also, they are throwing up on your floor. After the incredible buildup, release and cool-down of holiday spirit that begins after Thanksgiving and proceeds unabated until the end of the year, the last thing that any of us need is another damn holiday – much less a loud, intoxicated holiday interrupted often by screaming. We have one good holiday in December. That’s plenty. When it comes to holidays – and to proclamations like “I’m taking 20 shots for 2020, wooooo” – more is not always better.I live in New York City. It’s a lovely town, as long as you take care to avoid a few things: tourists, Times Square and large public gatherings, which are inevitably too crowded to be anything other than miserable. New Year’s Eve manages to combine these three terrors into a single event, and to throw in Kathy Griffin, mounted police and a million drunken people with nowhere to pee for good measure. You almost have to respect this abominable cocktail of doom, in the same way you might respect a jar full of every kind of poison on Earth. From a distance. It is not the sort of thing that you would invite people to.There is nothing wrong with marking the passage of a year with a quiet ceremony. Go out in the woods and say magic words as the clock strikes midnight, or stay in and whisper your new year’s resolution to your dog. Fine. Yet from coast to coast, the options offered to the public on the last day of the year are mostly bars, clubs and restaurants where prices have tripled. (The tripling of prices in turns triples the determination of patrons to act like monsters, in order to get their money’s worth.)Alternately, you can go to sleep early, insisting unconvincingly that you are not clinically depressed you can go to a friend’s party, which everyone will leave at 12:01 in order to go to another, more debauched party or, if you are a parent, you can stay home arguing with your kids about bedtime until midnight, when they will throw a temper tantrum upon finding out that they do not get presents. This particular holiday has the uncanny ability to make everyone, everywhere, of every age, more of an asshole. And we love it!Mostly, New Year’s Eve is about getting wasted. Because I do not drink, I find this a boring pretext for a national holiday. Some might say, “Of course you don’t like New Year’s Eve don’t turn your personal wretchedness into a pathetic pretense of principle, in an attempt to try to bring the rest of the world down to your level of misery.” Let’s not get sidetracked by these arguments. The point is: I’ll be celebrating at home, alone, with a nice glass of seltzer. You’re welcome to stop by. Or not. Go out and have your fun. See if I care.Tomorrow morning, I will wake up refreshed. And while you are passed out with a hangover, I will steal the money from your pockets. Happy new year. I hope this teaches you a valuable lesson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4663fb54d533d597ecd4b80fead486234a2ef748/0_20_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=192878b95f2b2b007fe0a3d5be9185f0","title":"only way labour win ditch labourism corbyn","story":"The next leader must take an imaginative leap that Corbyn didn’t – and accept the need for progressive coalitionsThe general election was not just a crushing defeat for Corbynism. It was a resounding verdict on the entire history of “Labourism”.Labourism is the name of a specific political ideology – a habit of political thought and action – that is almost unique to the British left. According to this belief, there is only one true vehicle for progressive politics, the Labour party. Trade unions have their place – to represent their members at an “industrial” level, in workplaces and on shop floors – but actual political campaigning must be delegated to the party, and the primary focus of the party must be winning elections. No other party can ever represent the working class, and any political movement that is not subservient to either unions or party is to be treated with the greatest suspicion.The naive belief in the unique political virtue of the Labour party consistently prevents it from developing creative political strategies. Decade after decade, Labour has pursued no other course than that of doggedly trying to win electoral majorities, under circumstances that are obviously unfavourable to that objective.Just consider this. Labour has never come from opposition to win a convincing parliamentary majority and then gone on to implement a radical programme. In 1945, when it won its first majority, Labour had the advantage of having been part of the wartime national government, in which capacity it was able to commission and publicise the Beveridge report, which formed the basis for its 1945 manifesto. In 1997, the only time a Labour opposition won a large majority, it did so on the basis of a manifesto that had the full approval of Rupert Murdoch and the City of London. It’s little wonder that the implementation of that programme saw the beginning of Labour’s long decline in the northern heartlands.Under these circumstances, any sane person might conclude that the obvious thing to do would be for Labour to form alliances with other parties against their common enemies: the Conservative party, their media allies and an electoral system that is always biased in favour of swing voters in “middle England” – giving far more weight to the views of ageing provincial homeowners than any other social group. How many times must we see a Conservative party with an extreme rightwing programme win immense legislative power, even though more than half of voters chose parties with a completely different agenda?All of the European social democracies that Labour members have long dreamed of emulating use proportional representations to elect their parliaments. Almost all of the progressive policies that those countries have pursued have been enacted by parliamentary coalitions, often including smaller liberal parties like our own Liberal Democrats.And yet, most Labour MPs and all Labour leaders have been so resistant to this realisation that even the great radical Jeremy Corbyn threw away the chance to form a government in 2017. At that time, commentators and sympathisers like Paul Mason (and myself) pleaded with the Labour leadership to do some kind of deal with the Greens and Lib Dems, standing down for each other in a few seats where each party had small but significant vote shares, in order to secure a Labour-led radical government. Had they done so, they could have formed a government, with the Greens, SNP and Lib Dems all very much junior partners in a broad coalition of the left and centre. I have it on good authority that the idea was discussed among senior party figures. But it was rejected out of hand. Once that opportunity was lost, Labour found itself caught in the cleft stick of Brexit, forced to campaign either for leave or a second-referendum, alienating a large section of its base either way. By 2019, the Corbyn project was doomed.Another criticism of Labourism has always been that it is inherently uncomfortable with the dynamics of movements – the type which has flourished over the decade, from Occupy to Extinction Rebellion. The Labourist ideal is for party members and supporters to campaign enthusiastically, but obediently, as directed by the party at appropriate points in the electoral cycle. Any form of mobilisation beyond this always risks bringing into being cohorts of political actors who are difficult to discipline, risking the emergence of a movement that is outside the control of the party machine.Corbynism, for all of its “social movement” rhetoric, never went beyond the limits of this Labourist ideology, although Corbyn and John McDonnell would have liked it to. Despite welcome innovations such as the creation of the community organising unit, what Corbyn’s Labour never developed was the capacity to campaign, year round, in communities and on the streets, with a clear sense of what it was campaigning for (other than just a Labour government), and who it was campaigning against (other than just the Conservative party). So outside of election campaigns, in communities up and down the country, the lies and propaganda of the rightwing press went unanswered.This failure was partly a symptom of sheer weakness. It was always going to be a tall order for the revived left to take over the Labour party, defend Corbyn from repeated attacks, fight elections and become a year-round counter-propaganda machine – all within the space of four years. But it also came about because too many of those at the top of the party had no desire for any such bottom-up movement really to come into existence. They preferred to retain direct control over policy, messaging and candidate selection, rather than allowing a truly democratic culture to emerge.Now, the only hope for Labour as a vehicle of radical politics is finally to break with Labourism completely. Whoever takes over as leader, they must enable the party and its members to lead a mass movement against the rightwing extremism of Boris Johnson’s government in favour of a green and social-democratic alternative. The basis for this movement must be an understanding that everyone in Britain – from the Surrey GP to the Blyth Valley warehouse operative – needs workplace rights, a robust public sector, a healthy democracy and access to forms of culture not entirely driven by the pursuit of profit.Even on the radical left, the fantasy of another 1945 (somehow to be magically achieved without the inconvenience of a world war and a national coalition government) has paralysed our politics for too long. The new Labour leader must be able to inspire and mobilise the membership as Corbyn was able to, replicating the success of the 2017 election. But they must also be prepared to make the imaginative leap that Corbyn could not, in order to finally win a progressive majority and implement the voting reform we have desperately needed for so long.• Jeremy Gilbert is professor of cultural and political theory at the University of East London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52932a082185e067cd5b8e0a091b05fbbdae7e55/0_213_4731_2838/master/4731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06da061aa18b7a0f46ce18cd5bec1a38","title":"best photographs 2019 stories behind them","story":"From Notre Dame’s spire collapsing in flames to sled dogs wading through Greenland’s melted ice water and Stormzy triumphant at Glastonbury – photographers recall how they took some of the defining images of the year. Selected by features picture editor Sarah GilbertJacinda Ardern after the Christchurch shooting16 March The day after an Australian far-right extremist killed 51 people and injured another 49 during prayer at two mosques in Christchurch, prime minister Jacinda Ardern met Muslim community representatives at a primary school. As I waited outside, I saw her through a classroom window between reflections of trees and late summer flowers. With those people in grief, her clasped hands, the furrow in her brow, her facial expression, show empathy, concern, sadness, but most of all, love. In a way it summed up the way New Zealand reached out to its Muslim community during a horrific time. Three weeks later, parliament voted in legislation to restrict semi-automatic firearms and magazines by 119 votes to one.Climbers queueing at the summit of Mount Everest22 May I was trying to break one of my world records, the fastest summit of Everest and Lhotse – the record was 10 hours and I was trying to do it in six. I ended up waiting there for hours, so I took this photo as evidence that the queue stopped me from breaking the record. There need to be better rules and regulations for safer mountaineering. Presently there are no guidelines about how much experience you need, so after this I advised the Nepal government that people should have to demonstrate they can master at least an 8,000m mountain before attempting to climb Everest.Migrants rescued off the Malaga coast29 August I took this photo after an inflatable boat carrying 132 migrants was rescued by the Spanish coastguard in the Alboran Sea. They were waiting to disembark and were being cared for by members of the Red Cross. They came from the Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau and Senegal. Upon arrival they were transferred to the Spanish Refugee Aid Commission, then ended up going on to France. The reason they make the journey to Europe is complex, but it is often because of extreme poverty, exploitation and conflict in their countries of origin. You see in their faces, tiredness, despair and at the same time an expression of hope. Every time I photograph immigration, I feel sadness.Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump at Buckingham Palace3 June I was waiting in the garden of Buckingham Palace for the arrival of President Trump for the state visit. They were landing Marine One and other helicopters in the garden, so we were a long way away from the palace, and there was heightened security because of the likelihood of protests. Jared and Ivanka were looking out the window so they had a view of the whole garden and could watch the president arrive and review the guard of honour with the Queen. There was a symmetry about the way they were standing for some reason it reminds me of Grant Wood’s 1930 painting American Gothic.Rioters kiss in Santiago, Chile28 October I took this shot on the 10th day of the greatest social unrest Chile has seen, with people demanding dignity and equality when it comes to health, education, pay and free, safe and legal abortion, as well as many other issues. I had got into the habit of going down to the Plaza de la Dignidad in Santiago between 3pm and 4pm to see what was going on with the protesting. That day President Sebastián Piñera had called for calm, saying everything would go back to normal. That just made people even more furious. There were fires all around the plaza, including one just behind the masked couple standing outside the entrance to the metro station. I decided to take a picture. I think chaos is the best word to describe the atmosphere: there was smoke everywhere and the wind was whipping pieces of burnt paper into mini-tornadoes. There were sirens, flares, and all the noise from the fire engines and ambulances passing by. People were euphoric, and were chanting against the president and against repression. They were toppling lampposts and traffic lights to stop water cannon getting through and sheltering from rubber bullets behind bus stops. There was real rage in the air. People had lost their fear of protesting and felt it was time to say what they were thinking.Interview by Sam JonesA Rohingya boy shelters from the rain in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh21 August A few days before the second anniversary of what is now termed Genocide Day, Bangladesh announced its plan to repatriate 3,000 Rohingya to Myanmar. The mood in the camps was one of fear and panic, and some families were in hiding. The vast majority of the refugees refused to go back without their rights, citizenship and safety guaranteed. I heard that representatives from UNHCR were going door to door in the camp, talking to refugees about the plan and answering their questions. I hiked for more than an hour to reach the camp, and as soon as I tracked them down, the skies opened up and a downpour started. A group who had been talking with the UNHCR team took cover under the roof of a nearby tent. For a few moments, this boy leaned out into the rain, enjoying a brief respite from the summer heat, seemingly lost in his own world.7 March During a Greenpeace ship tour from Manila to Cebu, we did an underwater audit of plastic in the Verde Island Passage, the heart of global marine bioersity. On the first e day I was shooting near the surface when I found this crab stuck inside a cup. I felt mortified, but not as much as I should have. It’s so common now it’s no longer a surprise, which is telling of the gravity of the problem. For plastic waste, the Philippines is the third highest ocean polluter in the world. It sits in the centre of the Coral Triangle, meaning an abundance of marine life is in close and frequent contact with plastic debris – I often see diapers, plastic bags and plastic packaging underwater. I hope photos like this help people understand the extent of our impact on the natural world. It’s not simply a case of ditching plastic, but of changing our throwaway mentality.28 June I had seen Stormzy perform before at smaller venues, so I knew how talented he was. But this – Friday night on the Pyramid stage in front of an 80,000-strong crowd, the first black solo British artist and the first grime artist to ever headline Glastonbury, and at such a young age (25) – was such a historic moment that I felt nervous for him. Once he came running out on to the stage, he gave off this energy. The place erupted. I was completely blown away. He has since said he cried after the performance. About 20 minutes into the set he had issues with his earpiece and couldn’t hear himself, and he came off thinking he had completely blown it. But he was incredible. It was pretty special.9 June I was asked to cover street style at the LA Pride festival in West Hollywood, California, in a creative and fun way. Typically, street style is shot to just show off what the general fashion is, but I took a different approach and asked people for portraits so that I could get some emotion and personality to come out. I was very specific about who I asked for photos, but these two were an obvious choice. They completely embodied the spirit of this festival – it’s a place to be entirely yourself, have fun, and spend time with the people you love. They were unapologetically themselves and that is exactly what I was hoping to capture.Women worship in the polluted Yamuna River, India2 November Walking along the bank of the Yamuna early one morning, I saw these women praying in the river. It was the Hindu festival of Chhath Puja – the women fast for three days, then dip themselves in the water and pray to the sun god. So many people look at this photo and think it’s snow, but it’s actually the pollution from the river. The chemical waste from industrial and household pollution makes the froth. It’s a terrible irony that these women were praying while standing in water that could affect their health. There were even kids playing with the foam. That week, Delhi’s air pollution peaked to a three-year high. In India, the rivers are very important in our culture and praying in water is common. Pictures like this show how rivers like the Yamuna are now so polluted, it comes in the path of your faith as well as your health.The christening of Harry and Meghan’s sonChris Allerton for Sussex Royal via Getty Images8 May I was honoured to take the official photographs at the christening of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, and to once again be part of such a special and joyous occasion for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Greta Thunberg addresses the Montreal climate strike27 September When Greta Thunberg announced that she was going to be in Montreal for the climate strike march, we all knew this was going to be huge. In fact, with 500,000 protesters, it was the biggest demonstration in Canadian history. To get a true sense of the magnitude of the event, I convinced them to let me go on stage to take this photo. She was like a rock star. It was striking, the difference between her shyness offstage and her level of comfort in front of a crowd she climbed the stairs and went straight to the microphone, then turned towards the sun and cracked a little smile.26 October Many of the wedding vendors in Sonoma county had actually evacuated their families before driving to the venue. The nearest fires were about 25 miles away and by the end of the ceremony the sky had turned an orange-brown by sunset it was a brilliant red from the smoke. The happiest day of this couple’s lives was affected by climate change nobody is immune from it. So we decided to get a shot of them wearing the air-filter masks: I imagined them looking back at their wedding album in years to come. There was a lot of love in the air, but the fires were a huge part of their story and this photo is true to what it felt like to be there. After three years of wildfires, it made me stop and think: is this the new normal for California in the fall?Sled dogs in melted ice water, Greenland13 June I was in northwest Greenland to collect instruments that had been deployed on the sea ice in December, a trip I’ve done annually for the last eight years. This year the Arctic summer had come a few weeks early and it was 15-17C – extremely warm for June. In the fjord, we found ourselves in more water than we had ever seen on the ice in early June, which reflects what we know – the season for sea ice is getting shorter. The early melting of the ice cover led to water that was 20-40cm deep. Even the dogs – who have a hard life – were struggling. The local hunters, who we rely on for their traditional knowledge, were uncertain and found it extreme. We reached our limits and had to turn around. After 48 hours, more cracks had developed and drained most of the surface water away, so we were able to complete the assignment. I think that, symbolically, the photo shows the impact of climate change and how societies are challenged to plan and adapt for the future this way of life and culture may not exist in 50 years’ time.Phoebe Waller-Bridge after the Emmys23 September At the afterparty at Chateau Marmont in LA, hours after Phoebe had won a hatful of Emmys for Fleabag, we were sitting round the pool, away from the main party, when I captured an impromptu moment. I produced her first show (Crashing, for Channel 4), so I’ve seen first-hand how hard she has worked from the beginning. It has been a surreal joy watching Hollywood and the wider world discover her brilliance. She is an extraordinary soul and a multi-talented artist who deserves every accolade she has received. This was one of those nights you don’t forget and I’m thrilled that it resonated with so many. It’s not every day you take a candid picture of an old friend that the world embraces with such a fever.15 April I was having a beer after work when my boss called. There were reports of a small fire on the roof at Notre Dame. As I set off for the cathedral on my motorbike, I could see unusual yellow smoke from 2km away. It was soon clear it wasn’t a small fire. People were crowded around taking pictures, covering their mouths from the smoke with scarves, crying, praying. When the spire collapsed, people around me gasped. I remember people kneeling, praying and singing hymns – Ave Maria. I suppose you could say it could have been a lot worse we could have lost the towers and that would have been the end of Notre Dame. Later, we started to ask, why had this historic building not been properly protected? How could this happen in 2019?3 September I’ve covered many hurricanes but none with Dorian’s force. It was a monster that destroyed everything. It did not stop raining heavily and everything was flooded. When I arrived, there were volunteers with jet skis and small boats rescuing people. I asked if I could travel with them but the space was necessary for survivors. I decided to walk to the flooded area and that’s when I found these people – some of the volunteers who put their lives at stake to rescue their neighbours. They walked to a high area to get out of the water after working hard to get people out.7 July Women’s football gained so much more attention this year and has become so popular, with record viewing figures and stadiums selling out. Against the backdrop of suing for equal pay with the men’s game, the US team had such a strong run throughout the World Cup that everyone expected them to win. There is a very different atmosphere at women’s matches more of a family event. The sport has a different feel too. It’s more about the team and the sport itself than inidual players. I took this photo of Megan Rapinoe after Team USA had won and been presented with the trophy. She struck this iconic pose for the cameras. I could hear fans cheering for equal pay from the stands.Torrential rain at the Tour de Yorkshire2 May I’ve been photographing the Tour de Yorkshire since 2015 and this was the worst weather I had ever seen. It was the first stage and I was working off the back of a motorbike. After the breakaway came through, the other photographers left, but I waited for the peloton to come over the bridge. It just started absolutely chucking it down. I had never experienced rain like that in this country – I was completely soaked through and one of my lenses packed up. It was sheer luck that Nicholas Dlamini came out in front in white and they formed this perfect arrow shape. My screen was covered in rain, so I jumped back on the bike to get ahead of the peloton again, concentrating on keeping my cameras dry. It was only later, while I was trying to dry off, that I realised how nice it had turned out.Protester confronts an armed policeman in Hong Kong25 August The protests were in their third month when I took this photo. Violence had broken out after a peaceful march and many protesters carried umbrellas, a symbol of the resistance movement. Hong Kong police officers drew pistols on protesters who were charging them with sticks. One officer fired a warning shot into the air after another officer fell. This unarmed protester in shorts and a tanktop approached one of them and dropped to his knees, saying: “Don’t shoot”. The officer didn’t shoot, but kicked the man, knocking him over. I got this shot a moment later, when he stood up and backed away, umbrella in hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bf1fb711ff993012b290a42a1b1522664ac41a8/0_0_5280_3520/master/5280.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=931349a642d926e9015e89a04b094586 1400w","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

Their numbers have soared since then, and experts predict there could be 400 roaming the park by 2022.A video captured by a Florida kayaker in October showed how closely humans can come to the monkeys. The footage showed the rhesus macaques hurling themselves into the Silver River from the treetops.“I personally am concerned,” said Steve Johnson, an associate professor of wildlife ecology at the University of Florida. Johnson and a colleague, Jane Anderson, published research into the monkeys in 2018.“There’s a low risk, but very high consequence should something happen. Fortunately nothing has happened yet, but I wouldn’t want to have that looming over me if I was the state,” Johnson said.It’s not just the risk of herpes infection that troubles scientists. The monkeys are also having a detrimental effect on native wildlife. Anderson found that the monkeys were “major predators” on artificially placed birds’ nests.“So if that translates to real nests there’s the potential for predation there, and so the environmental impact of something from an invasive species is what I’m concerned about,” Johnson said.“Even though the monkeys have been there over 100 years they’re not native, they’re not supposed to be there. There were brought there by people. They’re like feral hogs, or feral cats.“But they get a lot of interest because they’re mammals, they’re cute. They’re macaques, they’re primates, they remind us of humans.”The monkeys are said to be descended from six macaques released in the 1930s. A man called Colonel Tooey, who operated a glass-bottom boat tour along the picturesque Silver River, came up with a cunning plan to boost riders. He released the monkeys on to an island, hoping to wow passengers with scenes of the primates swinging through the trees.What Tooey apparently did not realize is that rhesus macaques are strong swimmers. The monkeys promptly swam away from the island and took up residence in the forest surrounding the river.Undeterred, Tooey and other operators used food to lure the monkeys to shore for passengers’ pleasure. The scheme worked so well that Tooey dispatched another six macaques to the river in 1948.It turned out that the monkeys were well-suited to the lush forests of central Florida. By 1980 there were an estimated 400 macaques roaming the area around the river.“They’re primates, so they’re intelligent, and they’re very adaptable,” Johnson said.The monkeys’ natural habitat s thousands of miles of Asia, where they are found from Afghanistan to the Pacific coast of China, Johnson said. They have the largest range of any non-human primate.Given many of the monkeys have herpes, they present a danger if they interact with humans – which they do frequently. In October Florida kayaker Rod Guynn shared footage of what he said were about 30 of the monkeys leaping from trees into the Silver River.The state added monkeys to a “do not feed” list of animals, but Johnson said that is unlikely to make much difference to the population.After Anderson and Johnson’s research was published, the Florida fish and wildlife commission said, in vague terms, that it was in favor of removing the monkeys. But the FWC offered no specifics at the time, and did not respond to questions from the  about the rhesus macaques.As Johnson points out, there is no easy solution.“If I was the manager I would want to try to have them removed,” he said.“But it’s not an easy decision and it won’t be an easy task. It’s a lose-lose with the stakeholders. You’re gonna hurt a bunch of people if you decide to go in and remove them, and people aren’t gonna be happy with you if you allow them to stay.“So it’s a complicated situation, no doubt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49781359cca3dcd2ef3752a8a0886bdef5016e39/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=774d253a1f398d8cb5db4710e7f5420d","title":"call for jetskiers and kayakers to keep away from marine wildlife","story":"UK Wildlife Trusts report says 2019 saw sea change in public attitudes to marine conservationSeals, dolphins and seabirds in British coastal waters are increasingly being disturbed by people using drones, kayaks and jetskis, according to a new report.Plastics, ocean waste and discarded fishing equipment have continued to devastate marine species in the UK’s coastal waters, while warming seas driven by the climate crisis have caused a boom in the non-native Pacific oyster, according to the Wildlife Trusts.The organisation’s annual summary of conservation work by volunteers, citizen scientists and marine wildlife teams aims to monitor the health of marine ecosystems around the British Isles.Reports to trusts about human wildlife disturbances have surged in recent years, with the latest hotline figures showing 245 serious incidents, most of which involved seals. In February, dolphins were harassed by jetskiers in Falmouth. The organisation warned that trauma from human disturbances can separate parents from their young and disrupt successful breeding and feeding.Joan Edwards, the Wildlife Trusts’ director of living seas, said: “People don’t realise how vulnerable animals such as dolphins and seals are to human activity. We share the seas with nature and need to leave space for marine wildlife – it’s important that people keep a good distance from animals and seabirds and avoid kayaking, jetskiing or boating near to animals, and avoid mothers and their young.”Industrial plastic, particularly small pellets known as nurdles that marine wildlife and seabirds often confuse for food, continued to harm ecosystems around the British Isles, according to the review. In November, hundreds of thousands of nurdles washed up on Kimmeridge Bay, a protected part of the coast in Dorset.Marine rubbish collected on Handa Island reserve off the Scottish coast was traced back to North America, Ireland, Sweden and Spain, including lobster pot tags from Newfoundland.Julie Hatcher, Dorset Wildlife Trust’s people and wildlife officer, said: “When the sea is rough on a winter’s day, nurdles are washed up in astonishing numbers – it’s extremely disheartening and hard to imagine how we will ever get rid of them. They’re just one part of the ocean plastics nightmare.”The Pacific oyster has also enjoyed a boom in the coastal waters in southern England, with large increases in Cornwall and Devon recorded in the past five years. Conservationists warn that reefs formed by the invasive species smother intertidal gravel and mudflats, making it difficult for birds and young fish to forage.Matt Slater, the marine awareness officer at Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: “Originally, Pacific oyster farmers were officially advised that our waters weren’t warm enough for them to reproduce, but due to climate change that advice is out of date. Pacific oyster populations have increased hugely in Cornwall and Devon in the last five years and it’s unrealistic to think we’ll be able to eradicate this species, so we’re going to have to manage them the best we can. There are big feral populations on the coasts of Kent and Essex too.“This is a cautionary tale, showing the unforeseen consequences of introducing new species, and particularly the effect a changing climate is having on marine ecosystems.”However, it was not all bad news. The Wildlife Trusts praised a change in the public’s attitude about the climate crisis and bioersity loss in 2019, with thousands of volunteers helping to conduct surveys and clear marine and plastic pollution from beaches.Edwards said: “2019 saw a sea change in people’s attitudes. The extent of the nature and climate emergency is becoming increasingly clear and more people than ever are volunteering to be citizen scientists and conducting important surveys or taking action to tackle the profound problems of marine litter and plastic pollution.”A new citizen science project recording sightings of whales, dolphin and porpoises on the Yorkshire coast was a particular success for the organisation, which represents 46 regional wildlife charities. The survey recorded 320 inidual sightings of minke whales, bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises.More good news from the annual review included an increase in the number of grey seals at South Walney nature reserve in Cumbria. There were only two in 1981, whereas they now number 483, including seven pups. Sandwich terns also had a successful breeding year at North Wales Wildlife Trust’s Cemlyn Bay, with 800 chicks fledging compared with 180 chicks the year before.Wildlife Trusts organised 450 beach cleans last year, with Sussex Wildlife Trust logging 19,000 pieces of litter weighing 350kg. The organisation welcomed the creation of 41 new marine conservation zones in the UK this year, bringing the total to 91, but said more should be done to protect cold water corals, forests of sea fans, rocky canyons and sandbanks around the coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/794ff89eff36ec49ed09ac2f104dfac5c79ad97b/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d23b69f6091c3b695d71c99d831c84e5","title":"pointless handbags and portentous brooches the year in fashion","story":"The ascent of Katie Holmes, Billy Porter’s Oscars gown and the welcome end of the Victoria’s Secret show – we look back at the highs and lols to remember, as well as those best left behindFor many, Holmes, now 40, will remain the awkward but erudite teen she played on Dawson’s Creek 20 years ago. For others, she is the woman once married to that famous Scientologist who declared his love for her by jumping up and down on Oprah’s sofa. But for followers of fashion, Holmes has become 2019’s answer to Celine Dion – with Monica from Friends a close second.But while Dion whooped and clapped her way to style icon status from the front row of couture shows in 2017, wearing flashy Balenciaga and Off-White outfits, Holmes’s ascent has been all together more low-key. Exhibit A: casually stepping out in a cashmere cardigan worn so louchely that the matching cashmere bra underneath, available from Khaite for $520, sold out in minutes – no small feat for a bra that costs more than the average monthly food shop for a family of four. Exhibit B: a chunky knit cardigan over a denim shirt with black leather trousers worn to a New York fashion show a high-fashion version of what her Dawson’s Creek character might have worn for a date with Pacey.Gypsophila might have had an autumnwinter moment, but it was the floral setting of the 10th anniversary show of French designer Jacquemus – labelled the kind of show “that Instagram was made for” – that had the hearts of the botanically inclined beating the fastest. Hosted in a field in Provence, the soporific fleur de choix was the perfect backdrop for the designer’s oversized blazers, bucket hats and bumbags.At Paris fashion week in March, the year’s least useful accessory was carried between thumb and forefinger down the Jacquemus catwalk, bright red yet barely visible. The Mini Le Chiquito, as it is known, became the patron saint of the nano bags trend – utterly useless, they couldn’t even fit your keys, and yet they became highly desirable, representing the ultimate power move. Who needs a massive tote when you have an assistant or car waiting?Nano bags are the younger sibling of this year’s trend for extremely specific bags. There was Balenciaga’s £600 water bottle bag, bags made to fit lipsticks and others perfectly tailored to fit phones. And the most stylish was part of Paco Rabanne’s retro chainmail collection.The nano bag’s place in 2019 fashion history was recently cemented when Lizzo pincered a Valentino version on the red carpet at the AMAs. As she put it on Instagram: “bag big enough for my fucks to give”.When the judge wore this arachnid accessory to announce that Boris Johnson’s prorogation of parliament was unlawful, people were quick to try to decode what message she might have been hoping to send. Was it that she had caught the democracy-dodging prime minister in a judicial web? Whatever was intended, the spider brooch, described by Vogue as “maximalist perfection”, became a breakout star. But Lady Hale wasn’t alone in sparking chatter with her brooch. The speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi wore a pin representing the Mace of the United States House of Representatives as she opened the debate about Trump’s impeachment. It was quickly dubbed her “power pin”. An honourable mention must also go to headbands. They might have less political heft than the brooch, but have almost as much historical weight as a Mantel novel, and made Anne Boleyn one of the year’s unlikely style inspirations. A sequinned Louis Vuitton hoodie on the carpet one day, an elephant-grey ensemble by Colombian-French designer Haider Ackermann the next the Call Me By Your Name actor is unafraid of the bold, conceptual and sartorially tricky. But that adventurousness has not put people off. His style has won him the moniker “the most influential man in fashion”, according to Lyst’s 2019 report, which analyses the behaviour of more than 104 million shoppers. He was pipped to the post of the “World’s Most Powerful Dresser” only by HRH the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle herself. Proof that the unorthodox can be enviable in the sometimes identikit world of men’s fashion. He even managed to make the world’s trickiest hairstyle, the bowl cut, an unlikely hit.It cost £40, was hailed as being as comfortable as a nightie and was as ubiquitous on the UK’s streets throughout the summer as chewing gum or pigeons. One article in the New York Times even claimed that the Zara dress had “conquered Britain”, so widespread was it. Plus, like the green Urban Outfitters puffer jacket and Réalisation Par leopard-print skirt before it, it had that most modern of popularity yardsticks: its own Instagram account complete with more than 20,000 followers.Porter’s own take on the Christian Siriano gown he wore to the Oscars in February rang true: “That dress changed the world,” he said. It was a two fingers up to the rigid gender diktats controlling red-carpet outfits – as Porter told Vogue at the time: “When you’re black and you’re gay, one’s masculinity is in question. I dealt with a lot of homophobia in relation to my clothing choices.” This dress, he said, made him feel free. “People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown – but it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”In a year in which Asos sold more than 12,000 pairs of Cuban-heel boots for men, the man with the David Bowie legs takes the crown as most accomplished wearer of such heels, after he wore them with aplomb – and a pearl earring – to the Met Gala in May. Honourable mention must also go to Lil Nas X who wore a chunky fluoro heel to match his fluoro suit, the work of this year’s CFDAVogue Fashion Fund Award winner, Christopher John-Rogers, to the American Music Awards last month.His legacy in the wider world might be – to put it mildly – mixed, but the fashion industry this year has been hit hard by the loss of the Chanel designer, who died in February. Known for catwalk spectaculars, it is fascinating to speculate what he would of made of the now infamous YouTube comedian who crashed the catwalk at the first ready-to-wear collection produced entirely by his successor Virginie Viard.His memory lived on throughout the year, via The White Shirt project, a stadium-sized Parisian memorial and a new coffee table book of pictures of his cat Choupette.It was the year in which unrealistic, prescriptive body standards, as championed by the Victoria’s Secret brand, were pitted against the inclusivity of Rihanna’s Fenty brand, which had its made-for-Amazon debut at New York fashion week in September. And, true to the unstoppability of the Barbadian star in the year in which she became luxury conglomerate LVMH’s first black female designer, Rihanna came out on top. Last month it was announced that the Victoria’s Secret show would be cancelled after months of speculation.When Kurt Cobain’s stained, moth-eaten green cardigan reached £260,388 at auction in October it was symbolic of the value increasingly bestowed on this once overlooked garment. Where once cardigan wearers might fear being labelled “dowdy”, now they can stand proud thanks to the ascent of cardigans to catwalks from Alexander Wang and Chanel to Ashley Williams and Christopher Kane.Women from catwalks to pavements this year have been wearing frocks that wouldn’t have looked out of place on the prairie. It was the look that wouldn’t give up the Laura Ashley ghost, having kicked off in 2018 with Brooklyn designer Batsheva Hay as its poster girl. In 2019 it went mass, and wearing a dress with a jaw-high neckline, tibia-long hemline and plentiful valance-style dust-ruffle-frills was a quick way to look as if you knew your way around the pages of Vogue – and Willa Cather’s novel O Pioneers!Not usually mentioned in the same breath as fashion industry buzz but the outer London home of traffic jams and self-storage depots became a hotspot this year when a collection by Louis Vuitton menswear designer and Kanye West protoge Virgil Abloh landed at the Wembley branch of Ikea. People queued through the night and the spot gained instant fashion credibility. As one queuer put it: “We are buying Louis Vuitton stuff for the price of Ikea.”When Melania Trump headed to the UK in June, she did so in an outfit that, in a cod Cockney accent, said: “London, baby”. The Gucci dress was decorated with images of Tower Bridge, Big Ben and a double-decker bus. For the year’s best example of “literal dressing” look no further than Rihanna at the cricket in Durham – all in white but not a V-neck knit in sight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c144a071736ba18018d870dcdd8ddbb67ee08f0d/0_0_3444_2067/master/3444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3a45df0d3f5cd6ee4e43b42ac290ff4","title":"best movies 2019 film guardian writers","story":"From a devilish documentary to a Hitchockian thriller,  writers pick their favourite films of the year that didn’t get enough attentionThis quite extraordinary film from the 28-year-old Russian director Kantemir Balagov was a prize-winner in Cannes in the UK it had three showings at the London film festival and then went straight to the streaming platform Mubi. Everyone should see it. The inspiration is The Unwomanly Face Of War, the 1985 oral history of Soviet women’s wartime experiences by Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexievich. In the shabby, traumatised city of Leningrad after the war in 1945, two women have survived: a tall, unworldly young woman nicknamed “Beanpole” and her friend Masha. The two women have a bond of friendship relating to the little boy, Pashka, that Beanpole looks after, and this becomes the keystone of a terrible, shared tragedy. A harrowing, vital movie. PBA rare modern film based on an epic poem, Swedish directors Pella Kågerman and Hugo Lilja’s first feature film Aniara begins as a sci-fi adventure and ends up an exploration of chaos, despair and cultural collapse. A transport ship moving wealthy evacuees of an increasingly uninhabitable Earth gets thrown off course on the way to a Martian colony. The cruise liner, replete with arcades and a psychotropic sense-memory evocation room, is self-sustaining, so survives as a generation ship. Help is always just around the corner, as are the numerous conspiracy theories damaging morale. As time grows infinite, new social structures emerge, some of which are technologically advanced, others more primitive. I’ll just come out and say the wordsinterplanetary sex cults. The film doubles down on weirdness, leaving no narrative corridor unexplored. High Life and Ad Astra both found their audiences this year, but this movie, far superior, unfortunately slipped into a black hole. JHA man goes to a nightclub, spots a fetching stranger sporting a leather getup, and scurries off with him for a casual shag in a side room – where the masked figure then murders the guy by spiked dildo. So begins an erotic slasher with a clear sense of humor about itself, counterbalanced with serious considerations for the Aids epidemic and the ostracizing of the gay, porn and gay-porn communities. A serial killer stalks the French blue-movie industry in 1979, targeting the stable of performers employed by producer Anne (Vanessa Paradis), who has some unresolved issues of her own with her ex-girlfriend and current editor Loïs (Kate Moran). As they jointly work through production on the film they title Homocidal and the body count continues to rise, director Yann Gonzalez stages ravishingly, ripely carnal set pieces at the intersection of fear and desire, a nexus at which the film’s milieu of decadent queer indulgence has been comfortably situated. CBWhile the premise of Penny Lane’s brilliant documentary Hail Satan? initially appears to be pure sensationalism – the use of black masses to counter white supremacy – as the film unfolds, the story becomes both stranger and more uplifting. Lane introduces the devilishly good work of the Satanic Temple, a growing group of activists who are challenging the encroaching overlap between church and state through the use of satanic imagery. So, if a government building in Arkansas erects a Christian monument on its grounds, the Temple campaigns for its own religious symbol to be built nearby: a 10ft statue of Baphomet. The theory is closer to satire than satanism, but there’s a deeply felt sincerity to the Temple’s work also. That goes further than its defence of democracy – its there in its embrace of ersity and a pretty impeccable set of moral values. Not all heroes wear capes some of them wear horns as well. PHWe’re living through a climate emergency it’s fitting then, that Canadian film-maker Brett Story has made a film about the apocalypse. Borrowing its format from Chris Marker’s Le Joli Mai, which examined Paris in 1962, shortly after the Algerian war, The Hottest August is set in New York circa 2017, during its hottest summer on record, eloquently drawing poetic links between the island’s rising temperature and the political tensions bubbling between its residents. Her vital critique of the way late capitalism is mutating both the planet and the values of the people inhabiting it invokes Karl Marx, Annie Dillard and Zadie Smith but the experience of watching is more visceral than cerebral, conjuring a genuine (and genuinely terrifying) sense of creeping, paralysing dread. An alien soundscape designed by Ernst Karel of the Harvard Sensory Ethnography Lab helps to create further a feeling of futurelessness. SHThe Last Black Man in San Francisco is the charming, elegiac tale of Jimmie Fails, a man trying to hold on to a San Francisco that no longer exists. Living across the water in Oakland, Jimmie dreams of a lost era when his family lived in a beautiful Victorian house in San Francisco, long before the tech industry changed the city into something colder, more manufactured, and less like home. Jimmie travels across the east bay every day and stealthily maintains the exterior of the house, mourning the fact the affluent white couple who moved in are allowing it to fall in disarray.Joe Talbot’s first feature film is many things. It’s an eccentric buddy comedy, on par in color and tonality with Wes Anderson’s works. It’s a near-documentary, in its look at gang culture, gentrification, and the damaging effects of toxic masculinity. But ultimately, it’s a portrait of a break-up, showing how one’s heart can be tethered to a place that ultimately does not love you back. It’s a film that deserved more attention than it got, and should definitely be required viewing for anyone who’s moved to San Francisco in pursuit of the American dream. GSThere’s a scene in Midnight Traveler, a documentary by Emelie Mahdavian, that has stuck with me probably more than any other this year: Hassan Fazili, forced out by the Taliban and deep into his family’s journey from Afghanistan to Europe – one he, his wife Fatima, and two daughters consistently film on their mobile phones – recounts a story of personal terror in voiceover. The screen is full of landscapes and undramatic footage Hassan doesn’t need to show you the story to get its impact. In fact, filming his family’s pain, what once felt like an act of artistic resilience, now feels ethically queasy. His meditation on the ethics of filming, of prioritizing the screen instead of the people in front of you, is one of the many surprising, deeply empathetic layers to this low-fi documentary that subverts any tropes in coverage of the “migrants’ story.”The film, stitched together by Mahdavian using the family’s cellphone footage and collected via a messenger over the Fazili’s two-plus year journey, communicates a much-covered crisis in bracing honesty by putting the story of a family’s formative years first. Its cadre of small, relatable moments – singing in the kitchen, playing in the snow, a playful marriage quarrel – make Midnight Traveler quietly revelatory. The Fazilis are buffeted by their circumstances but not defined by them at every turn, it prizes experience and honesty over seeking sympathy. Few films have given me the illusion of understanding another’s journey this year more than Midnight Traveler few films show more power in the quiet moments. AHGraham Norton aside, Ian McKellen and Helen Mirren didn’t do a lot of press for The Good Liar. It hasn’t made a lot of money and it isn’t figuring in the awards conversation. All of these are a pity, because it’s not just very well made, it’s also supremely entertaining – one of few films I’ve seen in recent years where I really wanted to know what happens next.The pair meet on a genteel dating site. She’s a wealthy widow he’s a conman who’s scented his next big score, and is faking it as a moderately hobbling old buffer. So far, so enjoyable. But the plot loops are more elaborate than that premise suggests the stakes higher, the history rather more freighted. Around the halfway point you don’t start wondering who is really scamming who you start doubting almost everything you’ve seen before.This isn’t a knowing homage like Knives Out nor a glossily postmodern box of secrets, like Pain and Glory. It’s just a straight-down-the-line thriller, built on a nest of twists, perched on shifting sands. It won’t especially make you cry or laugh, or think differently about the world. But it completely commands your attention. For two hours, everything else is irrelevant. And sometimes that’s enough. CSChinese auteur Jia Zhangke has for some time now been making brilliantly acute fables of modern China: a huge country undergoing a dislocating upheaval while still not fully recovered from the last one. His films tend to be oblique in intent, partly to enhance the ambiguous nature of their conclusions, but also useful in that – in contrast to contemporaries such as Lou Ye – Jia is not seen as a threat by censors.Well, Ash Is the Purest White is a remarkable film: elliptical and not exactly user-friendly, but building with a granite-like power that profiles the chaotic birth of the communist-capitalist era at the turn of the millennium. Jia, appropriately, turns to the gangster-movie format to tell his story, at least at first. A local hoodlum, or jianghu, named Bin, gets the sniff of power in the grimy industrial town of Datong after his boss is murdered his girlfriend Qiao is fiercely loyal but ready to disengage with the gang life. When Bin overreaches himself in a street fight with opposing goons, Qiao fires off a pistol and takes the rap – and the prison sentence – for Bin.Ash Is the Purest White then heads into less conventional territory. After she gets out, Qiao realises Bin has moved away from Datong and abandoned her, and she tries to confront him. But the relationship, it seems, is beyond repair her fortitude and fidelity of no account. Scrapping to survive in China’s new era, she falls in briefly with a man who claims to be chasing UFOs – and even appears to have some sort of extra-terrestrial vision herself. Bin, incapacitated by a stroke, returns to Datong, but their relationship is no happier in the long run.As Peter Bradshaw says, this is a “gripping parable for the vanity of human wishes” for all Qiao’s commitment to burning as brightly and fiercely as the white volcanic ash she sees on a far-off mountain-top, it’s her fate to endure disappointment and dismay. And that, I think, is something we can all relate to. APThere was an avalanche of festive films this year, seemingly more than ever with Netflix following in the footsteps of Lifetime and Hallmark by releasing a stocking’s worth of similarly low-budget and low-entertainment Christmas melodramas. But buried underneath the yellow snow, there was a finely wrapped gift, a surprising little gem that delivered a familiar assortment of ingredients but in strangely irresistible packaging. Crudely referred to as a teen Love Actually, Let It Snow focuses on a young, erse ensemble and their romantic misadventures leading up to the big day. There are precisely zero surprises along the way but there’s a wealth of chemistry between the charming cast and director Luke Snellin rises above the platform to craft a film that actually looks like it could be released in cinemas, rather than premiering on your smartphone. I was pleasantly surprised by Let It Snow, especially in comparison to the big-budget theatrical inanity of Emma Thompson’s incompetent Last Christmas, and unlike that film, I can see myself unwrapping this one again next year.

As an omnivore (admittedly one that ate little meat but a lot of dairy and eggs), I just couldn’t imagine writing recipes week after week with such a strict set of rules, let alone enjoy eating plant-based food on a regular basis. But then, something wonderful happened.Taking meat, fish, dairy or eggs out of cooking became a catalyst for creativity, forcing me, and many other chefs and food writers, to think in new and interesting ways about how to extract the most flavour and pleasure from the same old characters in the vegetable drawer.I discovered that the Asian larder, replete with its fermented and pickled ingredients such as kimchi and miso, could add flavour to meals in an instant. I reacquainted myself with the thrill of pulses and turning dry beans into nourishing meals, and I realised that cakes can be just as rich and fluffy and velvety without dairy and eggs.During the two and a half years that I’ve been writing the column, the innovation in plant-based food in recipe-writing, restaurant menus and even ready meals has been of an unprecedented breadth and scale. Vegan food is an exciting, easier and more delicious way to eat than ever.I am doing Veganuary this year in the main because I want to show you how enjoyable it can be. But also, because what we choose to put on our plates undeniably impacts the world around us. You, however, might be doing it because you feel bloated after the annual Christmas meat-fest or because it’s cheaper than eating meat, for reasons of animal welfare or just because Natalie Portman does it.For whatever reason, I’m here to help you through the next weeks with my meal plans.A few tips. The best advice I can give you is to make a plan of all the things you want to eat. Perhaps write them down here then make a shopping list based on that. If time is not on your side, focus on dinner. Breakfast could be cereal and lunch a throw-together affair involving pitta bread, jarred antipasti and a dollop of hummus. And finally, if a piece of ham should accidentally fall into your mouth this week, get back up and keep on going.I can’t promise a new you after a week, but you might think, like I now do, that plant-based is both achievable and delicious – and that thought may give you the freedom of choice over what you eat, which might just make you feel alive, well and hungry for more.Breakfast is easy – just be sure to stock up on some good vegan milk. My preference is for Oatly because it’s great in tea, coffee and porridge. Anna Jones has your back with this DIY instant porridge (below) or if you’ve got no time in the morning, try making Felicity Cloake’s bircher muesli the night before. Or else, buy granola. No one’s judging and besides, Dorset Cereals make a great one.On the weekend, try a tofu scramble, which is not by any means a substitute for egg, but a serious contender. Yotam Ottolenghi has a harissa recipe and I have a Parsi-style akuri, made using tomatoes, chilli and ginger.These days, every supermarket, food chain and cafe has as many chickpea wraps, soups and salads as you can shake a celery stick at. But if you want to make your own, the easiest route is to make extra at dinner and pack leftovers. Or, for a quick from-scratch throw-together option, consider Rosie Birkett’s broccoli and peanut noodles or her orzo and roast cauliflower salad.I’d suggest starting with a big pot of delicious beans so there’s something in the fridge this week. Try either my Iraqi white bean stew or this satisfying coconut dal with lime kale and some boiled rice alongside.During the week, you need meals built with speed in mind, but without compromise on flavour. How about this wild mushroom ragout with ziti by David Tanis, or Nigel Slater’s purple sprouting broccoli with cashews and tofu?Feeling the need for something fresh? This rice noodle salad with cucumber and poppy seeds ought to do the job.Friday night is curry night in the Sodha household. Might I recommend my Thai green curry? Feel free to play around with the vegetables, and don’t let the list of ingredients fool you – most get thrown into a blender and whizzed up into a quick curry paste.Welcome to the weekend. Treat yourself to these Anna Jones instant tacos and pop Ottolenghi’s ultimate tray bake ragu in the oven.Sweet tooth? This carrot, apple and orange cake from Gaz Oakley looks perfect, or these raspberry and coconut thumb print cookies from Ruby Tandoh.Now sit back, relax and congratulate yourself for getting to the end of the first week.

I like to give it an Asian treatment, especially after all the rich flavours of Christmas. Try to find a local, Asian supermarket, because they often sell coriander with the root still attached (it has a sweet, heady taste).

It is not just that they are European and world champions, or that they are well set to win the Premier League for the first time since 1990. It is that their football feels a distillation of the modern game. It is high tempo, hard-pressing football with a fluid front three and extremely attacking full-backs.So universal do those traits seem to have become at the highest level of the game that teams who don’t play in that way appear almost old-fashioned. One of the reasons José Mourinho left Manchester United a year ago was because his refusal to press seemed symptomatic of somebody whom the game had passed by, yet the biggest doubt about his replacement, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, is that he too is fundamentally a counterattacker who struggles with what has come to seem to be the defining quality of the best modern coaches: their ability to organise an attack so that they can interact quickly enough to break down compact defences that sit deep against them.The other effect of the game’s growing financial imbalance is the way so many top sides, unpractised in defending, capitulate against sides who actually attack them. Barcelona are only the most obvious example, their 4-0 defeat at Anfield this year following the pattern established by heavy defeats by Paris Saint-German and Juventus in 2017 and Roma in 2018. Attacking is the modish way to play but it has been aided by a general downturn in the quality of defending. Even Liverpool established their commanding lead at the top of the Premier league despite keeping only two clean sheets in their first 16 games of the season. That lurch towards attacking play seems ripe for recalibration.This hints at a tension that exists at the highest level of the game: on the one hand there is the carefully co-ordinated pressing and attacking of Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola – and in their various ways Antonio Conte, Maurizio Sarri, Gian Piero Gasperini and Brendan Rodgers – but on the other there is a lust for celebrity to provide content that can be marketed across the globe. PSG have perhaps suffered most from the Neymar Syndrome but it is a wider paradox that the same economic drive that has elevated the superclubs so far above the rest is also a potential tactical handicap. Even Barcelona, once, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic notably said, a club of “obedient schoolboys” eagerly obeying Guardiola’s tactical instructions, have become something more decadent, their hugely gifted front three often becoming detached from their midfield against the best opposition.But none of that is particularly new rather it is a continuation of trends set in motion years ago. Where there have been significant developments in the past year is in Brazil. The national team’s 7-1 defeat by Germany in the semi-final of the 2014 World Cup semi-final, followed by embarrassingly early exits in the Copas América of 2015 and 2016, represented the culmination of a decade of insularity. Under Luiz Felipe Scolari and then Dunga they were crabby and cynical, debilitatingly in thrall to the cult of Neymar.Brazilian football, it seemed then, had ignored almost entirely the direction football at the highest level had gone. They didn’t press, they didn’t function as anything approximating to a coherent unit and they seemed to want to play like some mid-ranking nation from the late 80s, with 10 players subservient to one great star. But this year has seen a rebirth.In part that is because Brazil has become more open to ideas from abroad, with the Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus at Flamengo and the Argentinian Jorge Sampaoli at Santos. Flamengo, in particular, have captured hearts with the beauty and effectiveness of their pressing football, winning both the Brazilian league and the Copa Libertadores. And in part it is because of the work done by Tite, who increasingly seems the calmest and wisest man in Brazil.After his success with Corinthians he took a sabbatical to study trends around the world and the result of that education has been obvious as he has produced the most sophisticated Brazil side in probably 30 years. Without the millstone of Neymar’s ego, they vindicated his change of approach by winning the Copa América on home soil in July. Brazilian football is suddenly forward-looking and exciting again.Underlying that assertion, of course, is a tacit acknowledgment that the best football, the highest form of football, is centred in western Europe, a phenomenon made inevitable by those same economic structures that have produced both the brilliance of Liverpool and the decadence of some of the other superclubs. A similar phenomenon, of the rest of the world following where Europe leads, was seen also at the Africa Cup of Nations.The final, in which Algeria beat Senegal 1-0, was the first since 1998 – and only the sixth ever – to feature two “local” coaches – although the term is awkward and misleading. Both Algeria’s Djamel Belmadi and Senegal’s Aliou Cissé played for the countries they continue to manage but both grew up in the same suburb of Paris, both are the products of European youth development and then of European clubs. Both have their sides, the majority of whom have similarly developed in European leagues, playing notably modern football, marking zonally, pressing and looking to interchange positions.Nigeria’s German coach, Gernot Rohr, was criticised by certain sections of the Nigerian media after his side’s semi-final exit for not playing “Nigerian” football but the truth is that such regional variations are becoming less and less meaningful. There is a form of football that has come to appear hegemonic and, while there are differences in how Klopp, Guardiola, Rodgers, Conte, Gasperini, Sarri, Tite, Belmadi and Cissé set their sides out, their basic principles are essentially similar.All to a greater or lesser extent believe in the value of a judiciously applied high press, all look to counterattack at pace, all have drilled their forward players into rapid interchanges and all have full-backs whose role is at least as attacking as it is defensive. This is top-level football at the end of 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57bfd88a9cba045cd52c3d65a48f58419ef777eb/0_122_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=020259a9f5382b0a5490d06f80b2c204","title":"manchester united transfer window january spend solskjaer","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær has reiterated that Manchester United will only spend in the January transfer window if the right player becomes available, insisting that he has the backing from the board to add to his squad over the next month. United have been linked with a host of potential targets across Europe before the window opens on Wednesday, including Atlético Madrid’s Saúl Ñíguez and Lyon striker Moussa Dembélé.After missing out on Erling Braut Haaland, who signed for Borussia Dortmund over the weekend, Solskjær has been forced to turn his attention elsewhere. But he has stressed that United will not be forced into panic buying in January simply for the sake of it. “I’m always an optimist,” he said when asked about his plans for January. “I’m a striker by nature and I’ve always been an optimist. I’m optimistic we can keep players fit and if the right ones become available, we do have the resources and I do have the backing from the board, but it’s also about getting the right ones. It has to be. There is no point suddenly bringing someone else in now for the sake of it.”Solskjær also warned he is not prepared to risk affecting his squad’s morale with signings that may not fit United, either. “That can disrupt any good feeling or chemistry in the group, because the chemistry here is really good,” he said. “It has to be the right type, and it has to be a good investment for the long-term as well. If we can keep this lot fit, keep improving and if you get one or two additions, that will be good competition for places.”Back-to-back wins against Newcastle and Burnley over Christmas have moved United into fifth, four points shy of the Champions League places before Wednesday’s trip to Arsenal. Solskjær was without Paul Pogba for the trip to Turf Moor, saying the Frenchman ‘didn’t feel right’ after United’s 2-0 victory. However, when asked if Pogba will travel to London, Solskjær said: “Yeah, I would think so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f5e66a584855b5aa257e0772891a2d48054ea35/0_9_2586_1552/master/2586.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f0a3cce3ac9ec15023b56ae62afd634","title":"david moyes west ham manager old new","story":"Well, I’m sorry to say again: it’s Moysey. In many ways the West Ham to which David Moyes returns this week is largely similar to the one he left 19 months ago: riven by discord, scarred by multiple defeats, lacking not just an identity but the most basic idea of what that identity might be. If Moyes was the answer, and then Manuel Pellegrini, and then Moyes again after him, then what on earth was the question?Moyes has signed an 18-month contract. It is the gloomiest of all contract lengths: a Sherwood‑at‑Tottenham contract, an Allardyce‑at‑Everton contract: a transparently unsatisfying compromise between sporting artifice and financial pragmatism. It is a contract that says we’d all like this to work out but, come on, let’s be real. And to Moyes’s credit he perfectly captured this insoluble paradox in the first interview of his second spell.Speaking to the club’s official website, Moyes expressed his intention to get West Ham playing bold, risk-taking football. “The players will need to be brave enough to take the ball and play,” he said, before realising a caveat was necessary. “But also, we’re going to have to defend better,” he added, at which point a little bell appeared to go off in his head. “But we’re also,” he ended with a triumphant flourish, “going to have to attack better.” Have three consecutive sentences ever illuminated a man so distinctly? And at this point one was reminded of a passage in Rio Ferdinand’s book when Moyes, as Manchester United manager, simultaneously instructs him to bring the ball out of defence while looking to play early diagonal passes. Once, after he and Nemanja Vidic were summoned to a video session and offered wildly contradictory advice on how closely to mark a striker, Ferdinand turned to his defensive partner and blankly admitted: “I don’t know what the fuck he just asked us to do.”Perhaps this, too, is what the former Everton midfielder Leon Osman was talking about when he described Moyes as the sort of character who “could give with one hand and take away with the other”, whose every praise would be laced with criticism, and vice versa. And overall the impression one gets of Moyes is of a man who couldn’t convince you to leave a sinking ship, at least not without warning to make sure you have all your belongings first, whilst remembering that speed is of the essence, albeit always allied with due care, notwithstanding the fact that gosh, it is getting wet in here.There is, naturally, an element of caricature here. Many who have worked with Moyes describe it as an agreeably bracing experience. Work rate and professionalism levels will almost certainly see an immediate bump. Marko Arnautovic and Manuel Lanzini, for instance, benefited hugely from his input first time round, and at a club where nutty mavericks have always had the run of the place – from Di Canio to the Dildo Brothers – the ability to restore some sanity to the henhouse is an underrated skill. Don’t be surprised if, say, Felipe Anderson’s goal drought – 22 games and counting – is broken very soon.But the wider issue has little to do with Moyes’s inherent qualities as a coach. In a way it all comes back to those nine traumatic months at Old Trafford and the subsequent career coma that he has spent the past six years trying to shake off. As he wandered from San Sebastián to Sunderland, from West Ham to West Ham, it is clear now what was missing. It was not the ability to run a session or spot a player but something more elemental: self-purpose, self-worth, the haughty certitude that opens transfer war chests and persuades potential signings to take a punt.The game has changed immeasurably in the two decades since Moyes first started even in the six since he got the United job on a technicality from a legend who recommended him. Accumulating thousands of miles on scouting trips feels mildly quaint in an era of transfer committees and vast player databases. Fans want a clear and stunning vision, not a walking oxymoron muttering about win percentages. Elite players demand stimulating, ball-focused training, not three-hour set‑piece sessions delivered by Alan Irvine.But then, perhaps this was the problem with West Ham all along. Perhaps the trouble with all storied mid-sized clubs – Everton, Newcastle, Hamburg – is that unbridgeable gulf between expectation and reality, where the interests of the fanbase – take some risks, play with romance, make us dream again – are at direct odds with the business plan, which demands mid‑table Premier League football in perpetuity.Perhaps, in this context, Moyes’s appointment makes a little more sense. Your club is 17th in the Premier League and has just hollowed out virtually its entire backroom operation. Betting the house on the trophy‑laden Chilean lifted you from 1.2 to 1.3 points per game and left you with Roberto in goal. Your next manager, whoever it is, will inevitably suffer a similar fate. Why give this situation an unnecessary gloss?And so in shuffles Moyes, the perfect emblem of these bleak and perplexing times: a man who neither improves teams nor greatly degrades them but will simply be there, right until he isn’t. He won’t take you in the wrong direction, because he doesn’t take you in any direction. His philosophy is encapsulated in those three eternal tenets: take the ball and play. But defend better. But also, attack better. It may just work. Then again, it might not. But also, it might. We’ll find out, I suppose, in 18 months’ time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54db4a1994f160df600e6119bf7a442b6cfde80f/1054_1955_942_564/master/942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bf64e20a82a9090be72ad49d4d57a3b","title":"david squires on cherished football memories from the past decade","story":"Our cartoonist plucks some memorable moments in football from his cheese-addled brain to remember the past 10 years by"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2faa25e9a4e3e65eaadd1373c0b3d734ce92f374/0_251_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc905ff4c2178601de190d995f358d51","title":"asias hardest year for dengue fever in pictures","story":"More than a million cases were reported in south-east Asia last year with poorer households most at riskby Photographer Luke Duggleby and journalist Laure SiegelThe global toll of dengue fever is becoming well known, with rising temperatures contributing to severe outbreaks that made 2019 the worst year on record for the disease.In 1970 only nine countries faced severe dengue outbreaks. But the disease, which is spread by mosquitoes that can only survive in warm temperatures, is now seen in more than 100 countries. There are thought to be 390m  infections each year More than a million of those cases were in south-east Asia, hitting the poorest households hard and stretching health services.The epidemic is exacerbated by poor infrastructure and lack of access to healthcare, with struggling health services  overwhelmed by outbreaks.Dengue is episodic, but even accounting for natural dips and rises 2019 was deadly.Since May the Angkor hospital for children in Siem Reap, north-west Cambodia, which treats more than 500 children a day free of charge, has launched several appeals for emergency donations.“We have an annual budget of $6 million and as of 14 July, we had already spent $290,000 on mattresses, intravenous fluid bottles, dengue fever tests and staff overtime. If we didn’t have so many mosquito diseases to manage, we could invest more in chronic diseases, intensive care and neonatal units.” In a rundown suburb of Siem Reap, three members of Piseth’s family contracted dengue this year. His 12-year-old son spent five days in the intensive care unit at Angkor hospital. In a desperate attempt to avoid medical fees Piseth, a tuk-tuk driver, first tried to treat his son at home.“When he started having a fever, we went to the first aid centre to buy bottles of intravenous fluid,” Piseth says. “We only earn $200 a month so we had to borrow $330 from a loan shark to pay for the cost of transport and IV bottles for the whole family. We didn’t go to the hospital right away, because we can’t lose days of work every time one of the children gets sick.” Chan’s mother, sister and neighbours all caught dengue fever this year, putting a huge burden on the family. Their squalid living conditions are partly to blame – the land is flood prone, there’s a lack of sanitation and official neglect.A few hours by plane west in the Thai town of Mae Sot, surrounded by mountains on the Thai-Myanmar border, François Nosten (above), director of the Shoklo Malaria Reasearch Unit, remembers even darker days, when the area was plagued by Plasmodium falciparum, the mosquito species that causes the most severe form of malaria.“When I arrived in Mae Sot in 1984, malaria was the leading cause of death,” he says. “Fifteen years ago, we still had 50 to 60 cases a day. Now it is one a year, thanks to an early detection campaign and a combined strategy of anti-malaria drugs and efficient community involvement. But there is no definitive global plan to eradicate dengue fever or similar diseases, particularly because the mortality rate is relatively low, so there is little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to invest in research.” This year also saw a massive outbreak of chikungunya, another mosquito-borne disease, along the Thai-Myanmar border. The strain has never been recorded in Mae Sot before and is believed to have travelled north from the deep south of Thailand on the Malay border.In Bangkok, Jaturang Wongjiragorn and his family live in a dilapidated shop-house on the edge of Chinatown and this year they felt the full force of a dengue outbreak in his neighbourhood. In September, his father went to hospital feeling sick. Following misdiagnoses at three different clinics and hospitals, which suspected flu or diabetes, he died five days later of organ failure brought on by severe dengue fever.After such fatal cases are reported, fumigation teams from the municipal authorities sweep in to spray affected neighbourhoods, but local authorities acknowledge that the efficiency of these short-term initiatives are limited as collective community responsibility breaks down in cities.From Bangkok laboratories to rural clinics along the Thai-Burmese border, there is great urgency to contain the disease.At present, palliative care is the only certain treatment for dengue. Work is ongoing globally to create a reliable vaccine. Following the Dengvaxia controversy in the Philippines – when hundreds of children died after being given a vaccine developed by French company Sanofi Pasteur – national health departments all over the region are cautious.• Photographer Luke Duggleby and journalist Laure Siegel received agrant from the Earth Journalist NetworkInternews to support the production of this story"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c12e80589705ea0a0ff7fcb4d10b45ce12de0d2/0_99_1498_899/master/1498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ff17331d00e66d8bc14ae606203e687","title":"field of broken dreams footballs slave trade photo essay","story":"All they want is to do is play professionally, but for many young hopefuls from Africa their expensive journey to Turkey ends in exploitation • Photographs by Italo RondinellaFor months, Yves Kibendo woke up every morning at 6am. He would leave his house in an ancient area of Istanbul, returning late in the evening, after working for 12 hours in a textile factory.He was paid under the table, or sometimes not at all.But Kibendo didn’t come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to work long shifts in a factory, he came to play football.Fast and talented, Kibendo plays on the right wing. Hundreds of young African football players like him arrive in Turkey every year to seek their fortune. In many cases, intermediaries bring them with the promise of a trial at one of the big clubs in Istanbul. The players pay up to $5,000 (£3,800) for a “full package”, including visa, accommodation and contacts with talent scouts.But many are left deeply disappointed. Shortly after Kibendo arrived in Turkey he found himself with an expired visa and none of the opportunities he had been promised. Communities often invest all their money in these young people, hoping they will become rich and lift those at home out of misery. But in most cases these young men find themselves stranded soon after they arrive.Sometimes there is no one waiting for them. In other cases, the trials are nothing but a show, with no real link to a football club. The young hopefuls find themselves alone, in a country they don’t know, whose language they don’t speak. None of them want to go back, having invested and risked so much just to get here. Even when the “trial” does take place it is often a sham. The footballers are brought to small pitches on the outskirts of town to show their abilities. But actually there are no scouts to watch. After a few hours, it is all over. They are simply told they have missed their opportunity, even though no opportunity actually existed.When their visa expires they are stranded and turn to Istanbul’s African communities for help. They are ready to do any kind of job just to survive. Many start working illegally in factories – mostly producing shoes and T-shirts – or selling fake watches and perfumes to tourists. They are vulnerable and often blackmailed by criminal gangs.Julius Kugor has been fighting these scams for years. A former footballer, he is now a leading figure in the African community in Turkey and campaigns to stop the trafficking. “We have written many times to the Turkish embassies in African countries, but nothing has changed. The boys keep coming,” says Kugor.To give these players an opportunity, a special “African Cup” was created 15 years ago by the African community in Istanbul. In 2005, only six countries took part. Now the tournament includes teams from 16 nations. The purpose is to raise the profile of the players. On the terraces of Istanbul’s small Feriköy stadium, agents and scouts from all over Turkey are joined by colleagues from Georgia, Azerbaijan, northern Cyprus and Bulgaria. They’re on the lookout for low-cost, talented players. At the end of the tournament, perhaps a dozen will find clubs.Sani Gideon got his big chance this way. A 29-year-old Nigerian, who plays on the left wing, he is one of the few who who has made it. Starting from this pitch in the suburbs, he ended up playing for Akhisarspor in the Süper Lig, Turkey’s first ision. But at the beginning it was difficult for him. He spent months doing cleaning jobs that paid only a few pounds a day. But today his story is an inspiration for many younger players. Whenever he can Gideon comes back to where it started and helps as a trainer for the Nigerian team.In recent years Turkey has become one of the major arrival points for migrants and refugees from the Middle East and central Asia. As well as the 3.6 million Syrians now living there with temporary protection status, hundreds of thousands of Afghans, Pakistanis and Iraqis have entered Turkey without legal documents. Faced with these figures, migration from Africa has not been at the top of the political agenda in Ankara.Yasir Bodur, a sociologist at Istanbul Şehir University, is among the few academics to address this topic. For several years he has been researching the daily lives of these immigrants, with a focus on working conditions and social environment. According to Bodur, the lack of institutional support exposes them to the risk of exploitation.“Football is a common passion helping to overcome the distances and open channels of dialogue with the Turkish population. But after the game, these guys still find themselves isolated from the local community,” says Bodur.Jean Claude Effa’Aessi is a football agent from Cameroon who also works forIstanbul’s African Cup. Before the games, he reminds everyone of the spirit of the tournament: do your best, play fair, respect each other. “There are so many talented young players among these guys. I try to give them advice,” says Effa’Aessi.Unfortunately, Kibendo could not find a team this year. Despite a stint as a professional player in Angola, he has had no luck in Turkey. Sometimes talent is not enough. Many clubs in lower isions shy away from signing foreign players because of bureaucratic and financial difficulties. However, Kibendo doesn’t want to give up. “But this can’t be for ever. If I keep failing, I will be forced to look for a plan B, meaning I will try to get to Greece on a migrant boat,” he says. “Even though I know I would risk my life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96f1935ba30ae03fe35a5e4b26ba3a4bdc6584df/168_0_4517_2710/master/4517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16460da53c249ac316ae015a513b3da0","title":"look into the light tips for great new years eve party snaps","story":"From unflattering flashes to making the most of Polaroids, a model and a photographer share advice on how to pose for and capture a memorable end of year photographNew Year’s Eve should be the perfect occasion for photographs – friends get together, everyone dresses up. But often by the end of the night you’re left with a stack of blurry, grainy or generally mortifying pictures. Tiah Eckhardt, a model and blogger who’s turned posing into a fine art, and Sonny Vandevelde, a fashion photographer known best for his joyous backstage shots, chime in on how even amateurs can walk away from the night with happy snaps they’re actually happy with. “The first thing I always think about is light ... where’s the light source coming from?” Eckhardt advises. “Is it an on-camera flash? Is it coming from the side? Above, below? I will reflexively change my position for the light ... There’s certain things that look flattering in photos and that people universally find attractive.” She suggests posing to emphasise your cheekbones, and ensure light is hitting your eyes – even if it feels uncomfortable in the moment – so they’ll look brighter in the picture. “If you’ve got a light above you and you tilt your head up to the light, it’ll cast a shadow down your cheek bones and makes your mouth look like a nice shape, it’ll get the light into your eyeballs. Where as if you tilt your head down, under an overhead light, you’ll look like a skull. You literally look like a decaying corpse.” If the light is coming from below “tilt your head down because that’ll get the same result – light bright eyes.”While it might work alright for a posed, group photograph, Vandevelde suggests: “When you take a photo on the iPhone with flash, it takes so long, and that moment’s gone.” He says in the seconds between taking the photo and the flash going off, your subject might be halfway across the room. “It’s not getting those in the moment shots. It’s not getting those candid shots.”“It’s hard to look bad in a Polaroid,” notes Eckhardt. In terms of posing for Polaroids, she suggests using a similar technique to posing for other flash photographs. “A Polaroid camera is much the same thing because it’s an on-camera flash, but it’s more flattering.”Vandevelde agrees: “I love Polaroids.” However, he warns “the problem is over time they will fade. So I always tell people if you’ve gone out at night and taken a whole bunch of Polaroids and have great shots, do yourself a massive favour and get them on a flatbed scanner and scan them at 300DPI so you’ve got a good digital copy as well. In 10 years time the UV will have faded the Polaroid, but you’ll have a backup.”He also suggests that the wedding-party trick of handing out disposable cameras can work for other social occasions too. “But make sure you save a couple for later on in the evening!”“It’s only worth working with a camera if you have experience with the camera and know how to change the settings,” says Vandevelde. This is true whether you’re using the inbuilt app on your smartphone, a smartphone app with more manual settings, or a DSLR.For instance, when shooting at night, “if you use a flash and just have a camera on auto-settings, the background might become too dark. You’ll have a really nice exposure on the subject in the foreground but then you’re not capturing the ambience in the background.”This is especially important for taking photographs with fireworks in the background. In those shots, if you’re not letting enough light into the photograph, the fireworks will “completely disappear”.If you know you’re going to be posing for photographs, Eckhardt suggests taking a quick snap of yourself before you leave the house. She has won jobs with this trick before. “I would get ready for a casting and I would take Polaroids or a digital photo of myself after I’d done my hair and makeup, and if I didn’t look right, I would keep tweaking it until it looked good for the photo, not good to the eye ... I knew once I left they’d look through 30 photos of me... So I didn’t do my makeup to look good for the person I was talking to, I did it to look good for the photos when they went back over them.”Just before the camera goes off, she suggests thinking about something that will make your face light up. Posing is “like any kind of acting ... with a camera you’ve got a second to do it. So you’ve got to think of something and then your eyes are alive.”Vandevelde suggests moving around a bit as you’re being photographed, “If we’re talking about night-time and party and event photography, I prefer to capture movement, even if it’s just walking … a flick of a dress … When people are talking with each other and they’re smiling, capturing that reaction is a moment in time, and it’s real.”Vandevelde suggests that you should not take your camera out at the beginning of a party. “I think the main key is wait till people have had a couple of drinks ... people will get looser, they’ll start having more fun.” From there “the more photos you take the merrier. Snap away!”Eckhardt loves candid shots, but she notes that often “it’s just luck. A candid photo is either brilliant or awful. And it’s brilliant because it’s capturing something genuine, or it’s awful because you’re doing something stupid. I think with a candid photo, four out of five will be awful and the other one will be great. Because you can’t fake whatever it is that you’re doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1ef7cd303b6ecdb7eb83dc85b3511f64e3aab8/0_352_5487_3292/master/5487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ae21d7623e1702a874fed9ac6964421","title":"48 hour phone repair service turned out to be the wrong number","story":"Quick Fix Mobile said it would repair my phone within 48 hours weeks later, I want my money backIn mid-November, I sent my wife’s iPhone to a company called Quick Fix Mobile which advertises 24 or 48 hour service.

Their total value was £1.8bn, an increase of £200m on the previous year.Estate agents and lawyers said they expected the number of high-value mortgages to increase further as the super-rich begin a spending-spree on luxury UK homes after Boris Johnson’s general election victory. Jeremy Corbyn had promised to “go after” the UK’s wealthy elite – including the petrochemicals tycoon, Jim Ratcliffe, and the Sports Direct owner, Mike Ashley – if the Labour party won.One European family bought a house in central London for £65m as a direct result of the election, and estate agents reported further huge “superprime” property transactions in the last two weeks. A Chelsea-based buying agent said a US client was buying a £50m home and a Swiss buyer was close to buying another for £20m.Pryor said central bank governors stating that interest rates were likely to stay very low for years would probably keep property prices inflated for the foreseeable future. “The irony is that as a result the very richest will continue to borrow despite not needing to and those who need to will find it harder to do so,” he said.“Wealthy iniduals who had put off buying due to uncertainty about the market are deciding to act now in order to take advantage of current prices and often because there is a sterling discount. These buyers often take a long-term view of the market and appear to be of the opinion that prime properties will in the long-term retain their value in the years to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32573a29faa9ce05d1e3aea4130aa850a1bd75a4/0_43_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b62635d5e42fdf7cc780ce9c1230c2","title":"abandoned at sea the cargo crew adrift without wages fuel or supplies a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

Söll, perhaps the best-known of the resorts to Brits, is renowned for its night skiing, as Austria’s biggest night ski area, with five groomed pistes lit up with lights until 9.30pm, a floodlit snowpark and tobogganing day and night on special runs, plus a valley descent you can ski until 10.30pm. Ellmau, too, has night tobogganing.Every fun day on the mountain has to end with apres ski, and you’d need longer than a week to sip a spiced glühwein (mulled wine) or flügel (a popular Austrian ski drink of Red Bull, vodka and cranberry) in each village’s cosy mountain inns and slopeside hideaways. Among them are Soll’s Moonlight bar, with several levels, and Fabels in Ellmau, both with live DJs. From 7-29 March, there’s even more live music than usual for the Apres Ski Weeks festival, with folk music, jazz and rock in the mountain huts, and free ski guides on hand to lead revellers between them.The most romantic thing to do after dark has to be visiting the Alpeniglu village at Hochbrixen, where 18 igloos offer overnight stays, parties in an ice bar and an ice art and sculpture exhibition. The sudden cold that arrives at night can shock like a punch, but here guests are soon cosied up, wrapped in furs and sipping hot wine. Sundowners in the domed bar carved from ice are followed by a fondue at private ice dining tables, a snowshoe treasure hunt in the forest, or a nightcap by the campfire. Then you can snuggle into Arctic-grade sleeping bags on piles of reindeer furs where you remain toasty warm until the morning.Skiers of all levels are in for a treat here – it’s one of the biggest and most modern ski resorts in the world, with 90 cable cars and lifts accessing 176 miles of slopes across the linked ski areas of Brixen im Thale, Ellmau, Going, Hopfgarten, Itter, Kelchsau, Scheffau, Söll and Westendorf. Each resort has its own character and cool features: Westendorf has fun parks and a snowboarding scene Ellmau is known for its huge ersity of runs, remarkable viewpoints and fun parks Scheffau is great for learner pistes and easy cruising blues and Hopfgarten is the perfect place for astounding views, especially from the top of the Hohe Salve peak, home to a little pilgrimage church and where 70 peaks over 3,000m can be viewed from the top, including the Grossglockner, Austria’s highest mountain.If you’ve ever skied in one of those cranky old resorts, with lifts that break down all the time, poor piste maintenance, and shonky overpriced cafes … well, SkiWelt isn’t like that. This is a resort striving to be one of Austria’s best, constantly upgrading, and with a drive towards sustainability. Most of the resorts have snowparks, there are many long runs down to the valley, challenging steep pistes and backcountry for advanced skiers, including long scenic tours such as the SkiWelt tour, which has 21 valley runs, or perhaps your own ski safari across the whole area. But it’s perfect for first-timers and families too, with gentle beginners’ sections in each resort, and an easygoing vibe. Even the terrain has a friendly look, no scarily severe-looking peaks, just the beautiful iconic limestone outcrop that gives the SkiWelt region its identity, rising above everything.This season, a new eight-person chairlift, the Fleidingbahn, with heated seats and bubble cover, rolls into action in the SkiWelt Westendorf, up to the ski area’s highest point at 1,892 metres. In Hochbrixen, a new Zinsbergbahn lift will replace the old, combining eight-seater chairs and large gondolas, the first of its kind in the Kitzbühel Alps, which also generates photovoltaic electricity year-round. SkiWelt Brixen has a solar-powered system for snowmaking that only uses reservoir water from rainwater and snowmelt, there’s free charging for electric cars in several spots and the whole resort now relies on renewable energy. These efforts have won the region several awards. Those who want to minimise their own carbon footprint while visiting can reach SkiWelt by train from London St Pancras via Amsterdam, travelling overnight on the Alpen Express sleeper train to the gorgeous, characterful city of Kufstein nearby (worth visiting for a day in its own right, for its beautiful medieval old town, cobbled streets, towering fortress and Stollen, a cavernous, speakeasy gin bar that has the world’s largest gin gallery more than 1,000 varieties).Yet, aside from the investment in constant modernisation, this is a region soaked in the warmth of traditional Austrian hospitality. The historic mountain inns (of which there are 81) feel somehow polished yet cosy and rustic, and cater amazingly well for kids.The family-owned Kaiserhof Ellmau, for example, is right on the slopes, with a huge spa and wellness area, amazing views, kids’ club and an award-winning kitchen that’s won two prestigious Gault Millau torques for its creative twists on local classics.Others have play areas that would be paid-for attractions in their own right in the UK, with unique and witty touches that are pure magic for little ones.Across every aspect, this is an area that knows how to have fun.Find out more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76d9eec59a5d90cd91f89133d45db29383181215/0_222_6009_3605/master/6009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2242b7060c11d4113be1a751a87e7f9d","title":"slopes and the city discover the best of both worlds in austrias innsbruck","story":"Looking for something a little different than your average skiing holiday? Innsbruck has everything you can ask for Lanterns glow, fairy lights twinkle and the sweet smell of home-baked cinnamon biscuits fill the air as you walk down picturesque alleyways on your way to an underground bar. Thinking back over your day, you remember the amazing views from that first run of the morning on the Stubai Glacier, the natural jumps you found in the forest in Schlick 2000, that thought-provoking visit to the museum of Tyrolean Folk Art back in Innsbruck and the amazing dinner out in the city centre. Not a typical ski day, but the kind made possible this winter thanks to a new holiday concept for the Innsbruck and Stubai ski area: a ski and city safari.How you do it is up to you. The easiest way is to base yourself in Innsbruck, which is particularly charming in the build-up to Christmas, then make trips each day to whichever resort you fancy, or whichever one has the best snow conditions that morning. Alternatively, create your own resort-hopping adventure, staying a couple of nights in each place in a mix of different hotels.Another option nearby is the gentler Patscherkofel, with a popular snowpark, three kids’ areas, a lengthy three-mile run and rustic hut cafes. Both are great options if you only have one weekend to explore.With one of the longest seasons in Europe, typically September to June, the Stubai Gletscher resort is a favourite of ski racers and ski instructors doing their training before the season kicks in. It’s also a must-visit for tourists, with 62 miles of slopes and 26 modern lifts, amazing views from the top station at 3,210 metres, and a lively scene at the inns on the glacier.Close by, Schlick 2000 is a traditional resort with lovely authentic huts, where you can try some kaiserschmarrn pancakes and slurp jagertee. Axamer Lizum– which hosted many of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympic events – is perfect for experienced skiers and snowboarders, where you can deep freeride when conditions are right, below rocky crags not dissimilar in appearance to the Dolomites. It’s one of Europe’s best-kept ski secrets.You’ll also want to make time for Kühtai, the highest ski village in Austria. Hochoetz is great for families, as is Muttereralm, where children can run through the trees amid the breathtaking views.Back in Innsbruck, après ski might start with a visit to see the ibex and wolves at the Alpen zoo, a trip to view the incredible opulence and painted ceilings of the Hofburg, built by emperor Maximilian I, or marvel at the majestic Court church, where 28 imposing, life-sized bronze-cast black statues flank his tomb. You can swim in the pools and relax at the sauna and wander through Wilten, the hottest neighbourhood in the area.A Christmassy atmosphere takes hold in late November, with the opening of no less than six Christmas markets, linked by walkways illuminated by glittering crystal trees and sparkly lights. Each has its own character, from the traditional, peaceful St Nikolaus market in the oldest and least touristy area of the city, set against a backdrop of colourful buildings fringing the River Inn, to the Market Square, where kids adore the puppet theatres, carousel and storytelling. Be sure to taste some zelten fruit cake, traditionally eaten at Christmas. But at any time of year there’s a fantastic atmosphere, and what could make for better après ski than a whole, vibrant city full of bars?

Cricket press boxes, like so many British institutions, run on tea and biscuits. Demand rises in proportion to stress, and reaches a peak an hour or two before deadline, right about the time everyone’s supposed to start writing. Last year, when Ben Stokes played like Botham, Steve Smith batted like Bradman, and Jofra Archer bowled like Tyson, the biscuit outlay must have run a close second to the marketing spend on The Hundred.There were biscuits by the barrel load, Bourbons when Stokes took that catch on the boundary at the Oval, Digestives as Pakistan narrowly defended 348 at Trent Bridge, Shortbread when Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow thrashed Australia all around Edgbaston, Ginger Nuts when Trent Boult trod on the boundary rope, Oatmeal Cookies when Martin Guptill’s throw ricocheted away for six, Garibaldis as Jofra Archer steeled himself midway through the super over, and Viennese Whirls when Jos Buttler made that last run-out, Custard Creams when Tim Murtagh bowled England out for 85, Jammie Dodgers during Archer’s duel with Steve Smith at Lord’s.By the time the Headingley Test came around, the ’s correspondent Vic Marks had taken to sneaking in back-up packets in his rucksack. ‘Tear here in case of emergency’. Amid all the confusion of the final minutes of that Test match, one really clear and lasting memory is the look on Vic’s face right after Stokes hit that last match-winning four through the covers. He won’t thank me for bringing it up, but Vic’s been in cricket a long time, 15 years as a player and 30 as a journalist, and, as many of you will know from listening to him on Test Match Special all these years, he is a wonderfully reassuring presence.Underneath it all, he’s always seemed to me to be pretty much unflappable, as any Englishman who’s spent a season bowling off-spin in the Sheffield Shield has to be. Whatever mess you’ve you’re in, however tight the looming deadline, you can rely on him to remind you that it’s not so very serious a pickle after all. This, though, was as close as I’ve ever seen him come to dumbstruck. We stared at each other for a giddy minute, I swore, he sighed, then bolted for the back of the press box in search of something to nibble on, since the emergency Hobnobs were, by this point, all long gone.Looking back on it all now it feels like we ought to savour these crumbs. Because England fans have learned by habit that the glass is half-full, and it’s hard not worry that what we got in 2019 might not be as good as we get for a while. It was the best, certainly, since 2005. Which is ominous, because, traditionally, English cricket has not been all that good at coping with its hangovers. That 2005 team started to wobble that same winter, when they lost their captain, Michael Vaughan, their spinner, Ashley Giles, one of their four star fast bowlers, Simon Jones, to the first in a series of injuries and their vice-captain, Marcus Trescothick to mental illness.By the time they limped into the World Cup 18 months later, the far side of an Ashes whitewash, the team was in bits. Not that many of us were watching it happen. Because it was at that same time, of course, the ECB had followed through on the deal they’d signed to take cricket off terrestrial TV and stick it behind Sky’s paywall. Which loops us neatly back to the present, and their latest attempts to repair the long-term damage to the foundations of the game that decision caused. We’re midway through the ECB’s two-year plan to revitalise the game. The players, and coaches, have made good by winning the World Cup, now (gulp) it’s over to the administrators.Because here comes The Hundred. At 6.30pm on Friday 17 July, the lurid technicolour dawn breaks at the Oval, where the Invincibles (“Vibrant, expressive, and free to play their own way, this team leaves a lasting impression long after the last ball” )play the Welsh Fire (“Burning bright with intense passion and relentless energy, their hunger will prove the haters wrong”).

Will England bear any scars from their defeat to South Africa in Yokohama? Will Wales – holders and grand-slam winners in 2019 – hit the ground running without Warren Gatland at the helm? Ireland likewise without Joe Schmidt? It all gets going in a matter of weeks, with England’s trip to Paris the standout match of the opening round.The seventh edition of this biennial competition is the first to occur as a standalone event and it takes place in Australia – home of the holders. Ten teams are involved, split into two groups, with England’s campaign starting against South Africa at the Waca on 23 February. Having been thrashed by Australia in the final two years ago, Heather Knight’s side will be out to turn the tables.The confirmation came in over Christmas that we are set for a mouthwatering rematch between two of the biggest personalities in boxing. Wilder and Fury’s first fight, in Los Angeles a year ago, was an epic encounter that ended in a somewhat unsatisfying draw – the return in Las Vegas promises much and this time there may even be a result, with Fury sure he can take Wilder’s WBC crown inside the distance.Lewis Hamilton will have his sights set on joining Michael Schumacher as the only driver to have won seven Formula One drivers’ titles and it is hard to see who can stop the 34-year-old achieving his ambition in what could be his final season at Mercedes. Someone who could threaten Hamilton is Charles Leclerc, the 22-year-old Monégasque who impressed in his first season with Ferrari and looks a star of the future.It remains racing’s big ‘if’, and may still hang in the balance until after the Cheltenham Festival in March, but if Tiger Roll turns up at Aintree to attempt a third consecutive win in the Grand National it will be a moment to match anything in the 180-year history of the world’s most famous race. He may not have a story to match Red Rum but Tiger Roll’s famous unflappability amid the Aintree melee makes him a hero in turbulent times.Mo Farah will not be involved having decided to return to the track in order to win a third straight 10,000m Olympic gold medal in Tokyo but other big names are expected to take part, among them the 2019 champions from Kenya – Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei, the latter becoming the youngest female London winner with a time of 2hr 18min 20sec.Manchester City will be aiming to win the trophy for a second season in a row having beaten West Ham 3-0 in this year’s final. The most likely team to stop them are Arsenal – Super League champions and current league leaders who may just have their sights set on doing the double. Joe Montemurro certainly has the players to achieve that ambition, no one more so than irrepressible Dutch striker Vivianne Miedema. All Super League sides enter the competition in the fourth round, which takes place on 26 January.The 67-000 seater Stade Vélodrome hosts European rugby’s showpiece match for a first time. Saracens appear unlikely to be there to retain the trophy they secured with a 20-10 triumph over Leinster in Newcastle seven months ago, while Racing 92, Toulouse and Clermont are all vying to take advantage of the final being held on French soil. As is the norm, the Challenge Cup final will take place at the same venue 24 hours earlier.For the first time in 15 years the Ataturk Stadium will host European football’s biggest game and who would bet against Liverpool returning to the scene of their most incredible triumph? Jürgen Klopp’s side have been in the past two Champions League finals, winning the most recent, and look primed for another long run in the competition. Saying that, Atlético Madrid, who they have been drawn against in the last 16, will prove a stern test, while the threats of Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester City cannot be dismissed either.England’s first action of the summer has the Test team taking on West Indies in three matches that form part of the World Test Championship. The Oval, Edgbaston and Lord’s stage the encounters as Joe Root’s men face West Indies in a Test series on these shores for the first time since 2017. They won 2-1 on that occasion and will be looking to complete a clean sweep this time. Pakistan also arrive in England for a three-match Test series in July.This will, quite literally, be a European Championship like no other – 24 teams competing across a host of cities, including Rome, Baku, Amsterdam, Dublin and Bilbao with the semi-finals and final taking place at Wembley. England will hope to go all the way and should at least get out of their group given they have been drawn alongside Croatia, Czech Republic and a yet-to-be confirmed play-off winner.Will Andy Murray return to singles action? That is the hope and aim but, it is clear from his decision to pull out of the Australian Open, that the two-times champion remains troubled by injury and so this could be another year in which he is unable to take on Rafael Nadal and the men who competed in this year’s truly epic final – Roger Federer and eventual winner, Novak Djokovic. In the women’s draw, Simona Halep will defend the title she won so emphatically against Serena Williams.For only the second time in Tour history, Nice will host the Grand Départ. From there it is on to Sisteron with the action, as ever, concluding in Paris. Colombia’s Egan Bernal will hope to win the general classification for a second successive year and he is likely to be supported in that pursuit by Team Ineos teammate, and 2018 champion, Geraint Thomas, something the Welshman has publicly expressed displeasure about.Royal St George’s hosts The Open for a 15th occasion and for the first time since 2011, when Darren Clarke surprisingly lifted the Claret Jug. Shane Lowry will be aiming to retain the title he won at Royal Portrush and is sure to face challenges from the likes of Brooks Koepka, Rory McIlroy, Jon Rahm and, perhaps, Tiger Woods.It’s here, the tournament that has cricket traditionalists scratching their heads in bafflement and banging the nearest table in fury. What’s for sure is that a fair few eyes will be on the eight franchises created in order to bring a new, family-centric audience to the sport, and with the likes of Steve Smith, Jofra Archer, Heather Knight and Nat Sciver representing the likes of Welsh Fire, Southern Brave, London Spirit and Trent Rockets, there should at least be a few moments to savour.The standout event of the year and the second time Tokyo will host the summer Games, having first done so in 1964. Medals will be up for grabs in 33 different sports, which includes five new sports – baseballsoftball, karate, skateboarding, sports climbing and surfing. For Great Britain the hope will be that Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson can replicate the gold medal success they enjoyed at the recent world championships.The 16th summer paralympic games will see 537 events contested from 22 different sports, with badminton and taekwondo new additions to the programme. Great Britain are targeting gold in a number of events, including wheelchair rugby and shooting.Whistling Straits hosts the 43rd edition of golf’s greatest team battle. Europe will arrive in Wisconsin having won four of the last five tournaments and confident that, under captain Padraig Harrington, they can triumph again. But the USA, led by Steve Stricker, will contain a host of the world’s leading names and undoubtedly provide a stern test for the men in blue shirts.Australia also hosts the men’s version of the T20 World Cup and for England it represents a chance to win a second limited-overs trophy in successive years. Eoin Morgan’s men are scheduled to face South Africa in Sydney and India in Melbourne during the Super 12s and could at some point also face the holders West Indies, who beat them in the 2016 final, a match that will forever be remembered for Ben Stokes’ battle with Carlos Brathwaite.Rugby league’s equivalent of the Ashes returns for the first time since 2003, with a mixture of venues both traditional and new. The three-match series kicks off with Tests in Bolton and Leeds before a finale at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, with the hosts looking to regain the trophy from Australia for the first time in 50 years.

Here are our six top tips to keep it safe in the new yearTechnology is changing our lives for the better yet it’s also exposing us to organised crime, online scammers and hackers – and whole industries built around monetising our personal data. But you don’t have to be resigned to cyber-victimhood. Give yourself, and your devices, a security update for 2020 and start fighting back.Yes, seriously. Your smartphone is a treasure trove of data, and while your passwords are likely to be safe from prying eyes (your password manager will keep them encrypted), what about your email, social media apps, contacts etc? Criminals can use these to change passwords, take account control away from you, and commit fraud in your name or simply steal directly from you. “Most people do not set any lock code on their devices,” warns Fennel Aurora, security adviser at F-Secure. A long password is most secure. Even if you’ve set up a fingerprint scan to unlock your phone, it will ask for your pin or password after a few unsuccessful attempts. A thief can try to guess your pin (and 0000 is still a common option) or obvious password. Smartphones can be configured to automatically perform a factory reset, wiping all your data, after a certain number of incorrect unlock attempts. For Android check SettingsSecurity \u0026amp LocationScreen lock, and on iPhones, SettingsFace ID \u0026amp passcodeErase data.While you may have read about smart speakers being at risk from hackers with maliciously crafted audio tracks or lasers (yes, seriously), in the real world there are more pressing security and privacy issues to consider. The account holder can see any requests that have been made of the device worth remembering when using one at a friend’s house. To prevent this, tell Alexa to “delete what I just said”, and Google Assistant to “delete my last conversation”. That’s assuming they have enabled the “delete by voice” option in the account settings, of course – which,. as a courtesy to your friends and family, I’d recommend doing for your smart speakers. While in the account settings, you can also delete past recordings for good measure. Using the “voice match” function for Google Assistant can prevent your personal results being available to anyone but you, and possibly Jon Culshaw. If you have enabled purchasing and have one-click payments “on” for your Amazon account, you can set a spoken pin to stop others shopping on your behalf and at your cost.If there’s one thing hackers really don’t like, it’s a liar. Especially if the fibs relate to those security questions sites ask you to answer as an identification method should you need to reset a forgotten password. “Most of the answers to security questions like these are easily acquired by hackers,” Tom Lysemose Hansen, founder of mobile app security vendor Promon, explains, “using simple trial-and-error methods based on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and even Wikipedia data, which give away much of our personal and family details.” Indeed, it’s incredible, and incredibly worrying, what a simple Google search can uncover. Instead of being honest about your mother’s maiden name, your place of birth, where you went to school or what you called your first pet, lie like a politician at election time. Of course, remembering fibs is harder than remembering the truth, and as with passwords, it’s best to avoid reusing the same ones for every site. Password manager apps can help, as they have a secure notes entry for every login.There has been much coverage of “juice jacking” of late. This involves a cybercriminal using altered USB charging ports in airports, train stations and hotels to infect your device with malware. You can carry a USB charger that plugs into a power socket or invest in a power-only USB charging cable to prevent this. A more widespread problem is that of free wireless internet access. “Criminals can exploit public wifi to steal your personal information, such as emails, photos, passwords, private documents and bank details,” Oz Alashe, CEO of CybSafe, says. Using a virtual private network (VPN) is recommended to reduce the risk. A VPN app creates an encrypted “tunnel” between your device and a remote server, protecting your data from snooping hackers. If you’re using your phone to check your bank balance or pay bills on the train or in the coffee shop, a VPN provides “a safety blanket that will help keep your data out of the wrong hands”, Matt Lock, technical director at Varonis, says.

Beckett would surely approveIf the work Adrian Dunbar is best known for – the police drama Line of Duty – left us with the tantalising riddle about the identity of the master criminal H, his new documentary tries to unmask an even more evasive man: Samuel Beckett. In Searching for Sam: Adrian Dunbar on Samuel Beckett (BBC Four), the actor we know and love as Superintendent Ted Hastings follows the reportedly too-small-shoe’d footsteps of his great hero.It was Beckett’s play Waiting for Godot that changed Dunbar’s life while a drama student, he says, so this is something of a personal quest. Go on, Dunbar, call him “fella”! But Dunbar is too reverential for that. “I’ve often heard people say Beckett’s work is difficult and bleak, but that’s not true for me,” he says, over images of Beckett looking, as one contributor memorably says, like an “Aztec eagle”. “I find engaging with Beckett’s work both life-affirming and uplifting.”Beckett was at school in Dunbar’s home town, Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Although they never met, Beckett’s life, says Dunbar – who has a lovely turn of phrase – “while elusive, is still within touching distance”. And so he tracks down the “dwindling number” of people who knew him, and follows him from Dublin to Paris, then on to the village of Roussillon, where Beckett and his partner Suzanne fled from the Nazis.Like one of the long walks into the hills Beckett used to take with his father, it covers a lot of ground, but not a huge amount of depth. There is no doubt it must be hard to make a documentary about a man so private and ambiguous, but much of it feels frustratingly shallow. Explanations are unforthcoming, which I guess Beckett would have approved of. Godot “revolutionised drama for ever,” says Dunbar, but it is not explained how or why.The film seems to rely on a lot of prior knowledge of Beckett’s work, which may be fine for many BBC Four viewers, but not all (and not this one). Dunbar is an engaging guide, but his enthusiasm sometimes trips him up – at one point, he says he feels as if he is prying, but a bit more prying is what this documentary could do with. Or a bit more levity (yes, I know we’re talking about nihilist Beckett here). Take it from the man himself. Stephen Rea, one of the “inner circle” of Beckett actors, says: “He never ever talked about meaning. He only talked about adding more humour.”Dunbar doesn’t always pull at interesting threads, either. Beckett falls in love with his first cousin. “You have to wonder what effect falling in love so close to home did to him,” says the historian and writer Diarmaid Ferriter, but he isn’t pushed on a theory. Beckett’s biographer, James Knowlson, says: “When he wrote about that, it really caused something of a rift with his family.” But what did he write? We are never told.But in many places it is illuminating – there is curious stuff about his relationship with his mentor and kind-of boss James Joyce – and its sense of place is rich and evocative. Dunbar starts in rainy Dublin Beckett grew up in an affluent Protestant suburb, largely shielded from the poverty in the city. He was expected to be a servant to the empire, go into the church or the army, perhaps, brought up with an ethos “of Christian, civic responsibility”, although, of course, he rejects this.I’m a sucker for specifics, and here it works best when the excavation of Beckett’s life is linked to his work. So his difficult relationship with his mother is illuminated by the mother-child dynamic in his works Company, and The End, and her death is fictionalised in another play. But it’s frustrating when the influence of Beckett’s experiences are hinted at but not explained. “What do they see on their journey?” asks Ferriter about Beckett and Suzanne’s fleeing Paris for the French countryside. “What kind of landscape is that? Does that find its way into later work? I think it certainly does.” Dunbar doesn’t ask for, or offer up, an example.Still, the longer the film goes on the more I like Dunbar, walking the streets in his leather jacket, and his opinions. Talking about the impact of grief – both he and Beckett lost their fathers fairly young – he says: “Pain makes you articulate,” but grief does the opposite. “Women bond face-to-face,” he opines, but men, talking about the father and son’s long walks, “bond shoulder to shoulder”.Beckett’s war years are portrayed as the making of him: he joins the resistance, working as a translator (he was “a terrible shot”), before he and his partner Suzanne are forced to run away once his cell is broken. What a life. In Normandy, he volunteers for the Irish Red Cross, working as a translator, driver and rat-catcher. “It seems to me that after the second world war, Beckett finally realised he had something to write about,” offers Dunbar. There is, says Ferriter, “internalised trauma” and you don’t need to be a Beckett scholar to know that it did influence his work. “He saw the world as a place of great suffering,” says actor Barry McGovern.Back in Paris, Beckett locks himself away for a couple of years and creates three novels and “the play that would change everything” – and no, I still don’t understand what that really means. It is a film that is as intriguing – but elusive – as its subject."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c8f74ea777deab505c309892933de151601bf8/67_20_606_363/master/606.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee474ef621b923fc25dc37e4e2eea295","title":"meet focus group man the most unlikely meme of 2019","story":"81-year-old actor Ruben Rabasa found fame after 40 long years by shrieking ‘stinky’ in a comedy sketch that took on a life of its own. He talks about his newfound notoriety‘When I read the script, I thought: ‘This is crazy. How can I say this?’” says Ruben Rabasa. The 81-year-old actor appears in just one sketch in Netflix’s surreal comedy I Think You Should Leave, written and co-created by Saturday Night Live alumnus Tim Robinson. But – as Focus Group Man – he provides one of the breakout performances of 2019.In the series, he plays a largely bald old man with a long, white mullet. Seemingly gripped by the fingers of the devil himself, he shouts out inappropriate comments in a focus group for a new car. Among his suggestions are “a good steering wheel that doesn’t fly off while you’re driving” and “no space for mother-in-law”. If these sound crackers, that is precisely the point Focus Group Man is the star of a show that is a pure white light of fully committed silliness.Unsurprisingly, Focus Group Man has taken on a life of his own as a meme. The internet is now riddled with endless GIFs of Rabasa dabbing and shouting catchphrases such as “teacher’s pet” and “STINKY”. There is a Ruben Rabasa soundboard online. Tweets have inserted him into Game of Thrones, and claimed that he is the boyfriend of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Rabasa remains modest. “I guess I get very passionate about things. I don’t prepare, it just comes right out.”His performance has also seen a huge outpouring of praise for the actor, who has been working steadily since the late 70s. We speak the day after he makes a surprise appearance on a panel about the show for the US culture site Vulture. “Did you see it?” he asks. “Oh my God, right away everybody started laughing and taking pictures of me, pop pop pop. It was unbelievable.”Originally from Cuba, Rabasa moved to New York, then later to Miami, where he says he found more work, and LA. However, it was not without its downsides. “In Miami, every movie I get, they killed me. So I moved to LA. The first movie I get in LA, I play a ghost. I said: ‘What the hell is happening?’” Luckily, I Think You Should Leave has finally pushed the jobbing actor over the top. With his increased profile, he is focusing on stage work and standup, and attempting to find a home for his sitcom, Americanos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2f4853c755f0d867b16cb370681493611b26b7/0_0_2558_1535/master/2558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d3bdc2e420be5e97e176a1b9b4e3776","title":"were you paying attention its the seriously tough tv quiz of the decade","story":"Think you know everything about Don Draper and Downton Abbey?

A moratorium will be in place for the first three months, during which time offenders will receive notification of the infraction but will not be fined.The Barcelona zone covers 95 sq km – 20 times the size of the Madrid one – and encompasses four satellite towns in addition to the city area itself. It will be monitored by 150 cameras.If these targets were not met, Sanz said, Barcelona would consider introducing a London-style congestion charge for all vehicles entering the city.“It’s about the democracy of public space and public health,” she said. “It’s a combination of reducing pollution but reconfiguring public space so that everyone can enjoy it.”The low-emissions zone is designed to complement the city’s so-called superblocks scheme, in which areas made up of nine city blocks are closed to through traffic and partly pedestrianised.There are currently six superblocks, with 11 more at various stages of completion. The plan envisages a total of 503 encompassing almost all the city.Inevitably, the scheme has its opponents who argue it will affect business and force people to buy newer, cleaner vehicles. Sanz denies this, claiming it will encourage people to use the city’s excellent public transport system.To this end the transport authority has introduced new tariffs, including a travel card offering unlimited journeys on public transport within the metropolitan area for €40 a month.There will also be a one-year moratorium for owners of banned vehicles who can prove they earn less than €8,000 a year, and for delivery vehicles.

She had been beaten, and a bag containing her camera, laptop and phone were missing.“The pictures she took that day have vanished,” said her sister, Priscilla.Sources close to the investigation say the case is being treated as a robbery with homicide, but the timing of the murder has prompted speculation that Martínez was targeted because she had been photographing the protests.“Chilean authorities should investigate the killing of Albertina Martínez Burgos thoroughly to determine if it was linked to her reporting, and do everything possible to recover her equipment and materials,” said Natalie Southwick from the Committee to Protect Journalists.In more than two months of mass demonstrations against social and economic inequality, thousands have been injured and at least 27 people have died.No arrests have yet been made over Martínez’s murder, and with the motive still unclear, friends and authorities have urged caution.Friends from her football team have said she was afraid to attend the protests, but pictures on Martínez’s private Instagram feed from the week before her death show masked protesters shrouded in billowing clouds of smoke.Martínez moved to Santiago from southern Chile 10 years ago to pursue a career in photography, working at Chile’s main daily, El Mercurio. She then moved on to work as a lighting assistant at a television studio.“She was clearly happier taking pictures than working at the studio, and she had a good eye for photography, but opportunities in the field can be difficult to come by,” said Sergio López, who worked alongside Martínez at the newspaper.He had spoken to her the week before her death. “She said she enjoyed taking pictures at the protests, even though she was a little afraid,” he said.Photojournalists group Frente Fotograficó responded to Martínez’s death by sharing her pictures of the protests, along with the hashtag #JUSTICIAPARAALBERTINA.“We will not forget her face or her name,” they wrote.The photojournalism collective Migrar Photo called on investigators for transparency and truth, and warned photographers to “look after one another”.The group said that police animosity towards photographers has intensified in recent weeks, as coverage of protests has provided evidence of human rights abuses by the security forces. Members of the group have received threats from the police, and have been shot with pellets, teargas and water cannons.Chile is considered a safe country for journalists, ranked 46th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders 2019 World Press Freedom Index.But since the unrest began 10 weeks ago, RSF has condemned a series of attacks on the press, including forced detention.Freelance photographer Giovanny Valenzuela was covering the same protest as Martínez on 19 November, and described a heavy police presence and “strong repression”.He said news of her death and shaken other photojournalists covering the protests.“The fact that we are in the middle of a social revolt, and a photographer was found dead without her equipment was very shocking. We feel threatened – and very sad.”Other attacks on press include an incident in which a BBC team was apparently targeted with teargas rounds, the detention of two photojournalists, and a police assault on an Argentinian journalist who was hit in the face with a baton by officers who then destroyed her camera.Martínez’s sister Priscilla said she had still not been contacted by prosecutors. “I can’t rule out anything because I don’t know anything,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/074ec425e5f3a101d29b509e541fbe832947a946/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27680314a15e816a855d699da9f6ae69","title":"rap does not shut up hip hop women of senegal","story":"All-female Genji Hip Hop collective use rhymes and art to fight cultural stereotypes and gender violenceAminata Gaye picks up a grey scarf and stretches it into a T shape. She ducks under the fabric, wraps it around her neck and crisscrosses it over the crown of her head.It is almost dusk outside, but in this windowless room there is no indication of time as Gaye gets dressed for a concert starting at 9pm. Her veil in position, the 27-year-old old is transformed into Mina la voilée (Mina the veiled one), her stage name as a rapper in Dakar, Senegal.“When I sing, I am someone else,” she says. “I don’t feel anything anymore. I’m unwound. It’s like I’m another person when I’m on stage.”When she first began rapping as a veiled Muslim woman, Mina endured a backlash on social media. Knowing that she was not alone was what helped her endure it.Mina is a member of Genji Hip Hop – a collective of about 70 female Senegalese rappers, singers, DJs and graffiti artists. Starting life as a WhatsApp group in 2017, it has since blossomed into a civil society organisation that puts on concerts, holds workshops for women and speaks up about women’s issues in the west African country.The women have fun and support each other as they address social taboos surrounding women’s rights. Their movement is both global and local: recently participants in the WhatsApp group discussed viral videos of women in Colombia fighting against rape, promoted Genji rappers’ music videos and shared inside jokes.On stage, the performers rap and sing about relationships, society’s searing gaze on women, incest, family pressure and rape.“Hip-hop has proven it can change things in Senegal, whether its social or political, it’s very engaged,” says Genji’s secretary general, Wasso Tankoura.One fight currently being waged by Genji is against Senegal’s rape law. Currently, rape is treated as a misdemeanour crime and the women want it upgraded to felony status.“There is not a family in Senegal where someone does not see a case of rape, but no one discusses it because often the perpetrator is a family member,” says Tankoura. “It is very difficult to speak about it because the person who is raped is the one who is judged.”Members of Genji are not keeping quiet. They are currently in the studio producing an ensemble song about rape and the changes that are needed. So far they’ve recorded the refrain:No more questions! We’ve had enough!No more questions! We’ve had enough!The support of fellow members helps the women stand up to the often overwhelming pressure they feel to conform.“When you are a woman, normally in our country, they tell you how you must be,” says Mina. “You must, you must, you must. When they are always telling you what you should do, you won’t have confidence in who you really are, but when you are a rapper you have confidence.”One example of the pressure on women to conform is in their marriages, says Mina.Normally, wives are expected to stay home most of the time, do the cooking and cleaning, and not come home late – a problem that arises if a rapper marries, as concerts go into the night. Newly married, Mina splits her time between her family’s home and her husband’s. Her husband, Mamadou Sagne, is also a rapper, and she says marrying someone within the profession has made her life easier.But others are not so lucky. The rapper and Genji member Eve Crazy recently orced her husband after pressure from her in-laws to end her career became too much, she says.They say we don’t have limits,But if someone calls me a woman,Then they have already put up barriersTo what they think I can do.Eve Crazy gave up two jobs to stay at home, and cook and clean for the family she married into, but the pressure to dress and act a certain way continued. “I didn’t have any freedom,” she says, describing how subtle, daily pressures often weigh the heaviest on the women.According to Wasso, the cultural concept of muñ is a thread that runs through the issues facing women in Senegal. The Wolof language word embodies the complex idea of societal expectations that dictate a woman must have “patience” and “silently endure” any harsh realities – even rape – for fear that speaking out will upset the social fabric of the family and community.“We hold onto everything,” says Mina. “The woman must put up with everything. Marriage is like that. Even if you speak to your own parents, they will say that you have to endure it.”Hip-hop allows the women to go against the grain. “It talks about everything,” says Mina of their art. “Everything society does not want you to talk about. Rap does not shut up, rap does not have muñ.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/566ebd6ee09af78afcaa33d6d18c419af2170465/0_172_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80b33cf8f2e17f90110850b835fbddc3","title":"us embassy stormed in baghdad","story":"Iraqi Shia militia supporters break into compound after US strikes on state-sanctioned militia Donald Trump has accused Iran of orchestrating an attack on the US embassy in Baghdad after dozens of Iraqi Shia militia supporters broke into its compound after smashing a door and storming inside.The angry demonstration followed US airstrikes on Sunday against three camps in Iraq and two in Syria. The bases belonged to the Iran-backed Kata’ib Hezbollah militia group, which is formally part of the Iraqi army. At least 25 fighters were killed and dozens injured.The Pentagon said the strikes were in response to a rocket attack on Friday against a US base in Kirkuk, in which a US civilian contractor was killed and four other Americans were hurt. It described them as “defensive”.An Associated Press reporter at embassy in Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone saw flames rising from inside the compound and at least three US soldiers on the roof.“Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,” Trump tweeted. “Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.”The US ambassador and staff were reportedly earlier evacuated from the embassy in Baghdad, after thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the building to protest against a US airstrike on an Iranian-backed militia group.Two Iraqi foreign ministry officials said the chief of mission, Matthew Tueller, and several of his US colleagues had left the embassy. There was no immediate confirmation of the claim. It was unclear how many diplomats were still inside.Several demonstrators reportedly climbed over the wall of the embassy, with others trying to push inside the grounds. They shouted “No, no, America!” and “No, no, Trump!”, and “Death to America!”, witnesses quoted by the Associated Press said.The bombings have provoked outrage inside Iraq and are the most serious incident yet in an escalating conflict between American forces and armed Iranian proxies. Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi – an ally of both Iran and the US – said they were an attack on his country’s sovereignty.According to reports, mourners attended funerals for some of the dead militia fighters in Baghdad. They then marched on the city’s Green zone. Local security guards made no effort to turn them back and the crowd kept going until it reached the main US embassy gate.Iraqi special forces were deployed around the perimeter to stop the protesters from breaking in. Mourners threw stones and water bottles at security guards. They draped flags over the fence belonging to Kata’ib Hezbollah and to Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilization Forces), a powerful paramilitary group of which Kata’ib Hezbollah is a part.Qais al-Khazali, the leader of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia, and many other senior militia leaders were among the demonstrators. On Monday, Iran condemned the US strikes as “terrorism” while pro-Iranian militia leaders in Iraq vowed to carry out further attacks on US forces.Street protests take place regularly in the Iraqi capital. In recent months, security guards have shot dead more than 450 people protesting against rampant government corruption and the growing influence of Iranian-backed groups, including Kata’ib Hezbollah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0e4e6e9e4a5479dc779b7687dd231442c831016/0_122_1431_858/master/1431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79d5b47649d567a54b696e65afd5b403","title":"2019 year of unrest in the americas in pictures","story":"Wave of protests and violence against austerity measures and political corruption swept Bolivia, Venezuela, Chile and other Latin American countries "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1952d6b2e1e1d7dfb6954318297b4c8c5f79a403/0_156_4682_2809/master/4682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c897d5626deab99053f46437c74c0376","title":"new years eve 2019 celebrations around the world as they happen","story":"Follow all the celebrations as the clock strikes midnight and countries see out 2019 and welcome in the twentiesHere are some photographs from the New Year’s Eve celebrations in Sydney.It is nearly midnight in much of Australia (in cities like Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra).Tens of thousands of Victorians have gathered in Melbourne to enjoy an early New Year celebration, reports the Australian Associated Press.As the city darkened and the weather settled near 20C, families gathered next to Melbourne Cricket Ground to watch movies, listen to music and witness an early seven-minute firework show that will serve as an appetiser for the midnight show.Police heavily secured the surrounding area. Many officers relaxedly patrolled the streets and walkways, takings pictures with some of the attendees.More than 500 security guards, 118 marshals and 22 area wardens are employed for the celebration, which has five kilometres of fencing across the city.Along the Yarra River bend, skaters spent the last hours of the night practising their tricks while groups of friends secured a spot to watch the spectacular fireworks that will fill the city with light at midnight.More than 14 tonnes of fireworks will be used for the City of Melbourne’s show, called Reach For The Stars.The city council says New Year’s Eve 2019 will help raise funds for the Salvation Army Emergency Services responding to bushfires in Victoria, NSW, Queensland and Western Australia.Here are some photographs from the new year celebrations in Auckland, New Zealand, which welcomed the dawn of 2020 just over an hour ago.Looking for a way to kill some time before this evening’s new year’s celebrations? Take our, very hard, TV quiz of the decade.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has issued a new year’s message, saying the world is entering 2020 with “uncertainty and insecurity” all around.“We cannot afford to be the generation that fiddled while the planet burned,” he said, adding that there was hope in the power of youth around the planet. “From climate action to gender equality to social justice and human rights, your generation is on the frontlines and in the headlines,” he said. “I am inspired by your passion and determination.”Preparations are under way in Edinburgh for its Hogmanay festival amid a row over the rights of residents in the city’s centre to access their homes.The leader of Edinburgh council, Adam McVey, has accused Underbelly, the events company that runs Edinburgh’s winter and Hogmanay festivals, for the dispute over access rights for people who live within the large security zone covered by the festival.The row erupted last week after it emerged that the festival’s organisers had said applications by residents for any more than six access passes would be screened by the police. This is from the ’s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell.About 75,000 revellers are expected to converge on the Hogmanay festival site, called the arena by Underbelly, for performances featuring Mark Ronson, Marc Almond and other acts spread over several stages.Residential and shopping areas such as Rose Street, Princes Street, Mound Place, Castle Street, Frederick Street and Hanover Street will be cordoned off with steel barriers and security checks.One of its biggest events is the Hogmanay fireworks display from Edinburgh Castle. But residents inside the zone will be barred from viewing it at street level unless they have bought festival tickets.To the anger of community groups, Underbelly also suggested that if residents wanted larger numbers of access passes for their own Hogmanay parties, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service would be asked to check that was within safety limits for their property.You can read the full story here.’s community team wants to know what your hopes for the next decade are.As 2019 draws to a close, we want to find out your hopes, dreams and desires for the next decade.The 2010s have provided the world with an array of defining challenges: from the rise in political populism to the fight against the climate emergency. There have been huge people movements from the Arab spring to Black Lives Matter, MeToo and the Global climate strikes.It was a defining decade for LGBTQ people from the very start, with Argentina legalising same-sex marriage and communities grappling with how gender should be constructed.The advancement of tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon has dramatically altered how people connect with media and each other.In the UK, love it or hate it, Brexit, became one of the most defining moments of British political history.In such complex and turbulent times it is almost impossible to know what the future holds for us all.

You can watch it here.“Family Fireworks” have been launched over Sydney Harbour as part of New Year’s Eve celebrations. The smaller fireworks display is launched at 9pm local time for children and families. Wondering what 2020 might have in store for us here in the UK? Here’s the Observer’s guide to who and what to look out for.It is now 2020 in Samoa.The South Pacific country battled a measles outbreak in 2019, having to impose a six-week state of emergency in November. The highly infectious disease killed 81 people, most of them babies and young children, and left more than 5,600 others ill.The country’s prime minister, Tuilaepa Sailele, has also been outspoken about climate change, which is affecting the island nation more than most. “Climate change crosses borders uninvited and does not discriminate by size or economic status,” he said earlier this year.“It impacts every country, though some more extensively than others like small island developing states, because of their particular and unique vulnerabilities.”Sydney’s New Year’s Eve fireworks became contentious this year as the country faces an unprecedented bushfire crisis. With 100 fires burning in New South Wales and a total fire ban across Sydney, more than 275,000 people signed a petition calling for the fireworks to be cancelled and the money donated to fire relief. But authorities insisted the money had already been spent and signalled the event generates $130m for the NSW economy. The state’s fire service granted an exemption from the fire ban for Sydney’s fireworks while many other events around the state had to be cancelled. Sydney’s lord mayor said the council had already donated $620,000 to bushfire and drought-affected communities and the broadcast of the event would also act as a fundraiser for further relief money. Good morning – or evening, depending on your perspective – and welcome to the ’s New Year’s Eve live blog. We’ll be covering the festivities as people celebrate the dawning of the year 2020 around the globe, starting in the Pacific on Christmas Island and Samoa, where the clock will strike midnight in 15 minutes.It’s been an astonishing year, from the impeachment of the US president to the landslide Conservative victory in the UK general election. There was unrest in Hong Kong as well as global climate change protests, major terror attacks from New Zealand to Sri Lanka, and natural disasters – most recently the bushfires in Australia – kill thousands.We’ll be bringing you reflections on 2019 – and indeed the past decade – as the day progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Thunberg, Brexit and Ana Kri\u0026eacutegel articles figure prominently in popular storiesInvestigators use facial recognition technology across Europe in a bid to find suspectGarda\u0026iacute making good progress in investigation into murder of Frankie Dunne (64)Adrienne Cullen died last New Year\u0026rsquos Eve from late-diagnosed cervical cancerT\u0026aacutenaiste cautions against immediate Border poll against backdrop of Brexit and efforts to restore Stormont assemblyCo-payments to form part of proposals to be presented to Cabinet in JanuaryPassport control checks moved from migration posts to steps of aircraftSiptu also suggests row brewing in National Ambulance Service in coming monthsUnconfined joy among some of Charlie Haughey\u0026rsquos most fervent supporters when returned as taoiseach in 1987Attempt to upgrade diplomatic representation in Tehran in exchange for help in securing release \u0026lsquocynical and disquieting\u0026rsquoFewer Albanians, Georgians apply for asylum as impact of Garda operation feltDoctors providing new service have overwhemingly positive viewServices are available in 10 out of 19 maternity units, and through 347 GPs in the communityMother who strangled baby and woman who poisoned neighbour moved in with religious orders after their sentences were commuted, files from 1943 showCabinet called for inquiry after members of Sinn F\u0026eacutein invited by Labour MPs were \u0026lsquoleft unattended for some time\u0026rsquoTaoiseach Charles Haughey received some novel advice from members of the public on how to end the TroublesLabour leader also said he broke off talks with Fianna F\u0026aacuteil in 1994 because he could not trust them, new files revealBritish government papers show concerns over \u0026lsquohiding-behind-potted-plants scenario\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4128027.1577791964!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greta thunberg column is most read irish times article of 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClimate activist Greta Thunberg speaks at the UN Climate Action Summit on September 23rd, 2019 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City.

Photograph: Getty Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has fled to Lebanon, saying he wouldn’t be “held hostage” by a “rigged” system, raising questions about how one of the world’s most-recognised executives slipped out of Japan months before his trial.Mr Ghosn’s abrupt departure marks the latest dramatic twist in a year-old saga that has shaken the global car industry, jeopardised the alliance of Nissan Motor Co and top shareholder Renault SA and cast a harsh light on Japan’s judicial system.“I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied,” Mr Ghosn ( 65) said in a brief statement on Tuesday.“I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution. I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Tokyo officials have previously said the system is not inhumane and that Mr Ghosn has been treated like any other suspect.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan, given that he had been under strict surveillance by authorities while out on bail and had surrendered his passports.Mr Ghosn arrived in Beirut on a private jet from Istanbul on Monday, people familiar with the matter said.Immigration authorities had no record of Mr Ghosn leaving the country, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said.A person resembling him entered Beirut international airport under a different name, NHK reported, citing an unidentified Lebanese security official.His lawyers were still in possession of his three passports, one of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters.Mr Hironaka, in comments broadcast live on NHK, said the first he had heard of Mr Ghosn’s departure was on the news this morning and that he was surprised. He also said it was “inexcusable behaviour”.Japan has extradition treaties with only the United States and South Korea, according to the justice ministry, meaning it could be difficult to force Ghosn to return to stand trial.While his arrest on financial misconduct charges last year ensured a dramatic fall from grace in Japan, he retains more popularity in Lebanon, where billboards saying “We are all Carlos Ghosn” were erected in his support and he was previously featured on a postage stamp.Born in Brazil of Lebanese ancestry, Mr Ghosn grew up in Beirut and has retained close ties to Lebanon.A spokeswoman for the Lebanese embassy in Tokyo said “we did not receive any information” on the matter. Calls to the Brazilian embassy went unanswered. A French minister said she was “very surprised” by news of Mr Ghosn’s emergence in Lebanon.Mr Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018, shortly after his private jet touched down at the airport. He faces four charges - which he denies - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman saying internal investigations revealed misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.The case cast a harsh light on Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was initially released in March on a record $9 million bail only to be arrested on related charges weeks later and then released on bail again at the end of April.His movement and communications have been monitored and restricted to prevent his fleeing the country and tampering with evidence, the Tokyo District court previously said.The terms of his bail have also been striking by western standards. He has been prevented from communicating with his wife, Carole, and had his use of the internet and other communications curtailed.Carole is now with him in Lebanon at a house with armed guards outside, the New York Times reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”, one person told The Wall Street Journal.A person familiar with Nissan’s thinking said: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court.”The trial was widely expected to start in April. Mr Ghosn’s Japanese lawyers have fought, so far unsuccessfully, to get access to 6,000 pieces of evidence collected from Nissan, which they say is crucial to a fair trial.Mr Ghosn has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing closer ties between the Japanese automaker and its biggest shareholder Renault, of which Mr Ghosn was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover by Renault.Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer.”After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, Mr Ghosn used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business super-star status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life. - Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000213213788_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqKkzUGe8q7_A35DWV6BPUcYCeVS7pgEPwpvy85C08PWY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"summer holiday cyprus turned nightmare british teenager gang","story":"Clubbers in a bar in Ayia NapaIt was intended to be a sun-soaked working holiday, a rite of passage between finishing school and starting university.

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence.A person resembling Mr Ghosn entered Beirut’s Rafic al-Hariri International Airport under a different name after flying in on a private jet, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, citing an unidentified Lebanese security official.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBritain may have avoided recession – but we shouldn’t be celebratingAdded to all\u0026nbspthis was the volatile situation between the US and China as their trade war escalated over the year, which has compounded the global growth slowdown, with knock-on effects on the UK.Official figures showed Britain’s growth flatlined in October and sector surveys since then have painted an equally gloomy picture.The Bank of England cut its outlook for fourth-quarter growth to a paltry 0.1 per cent as the prospects for the economy began to look decidedly downbeat and left the door firmly open to an interest rate cut in its last decision of 2019.While rates were held at 0.75 per cent all year, two of the Bank’s policymakers have voted since November for a cut to 0.5 per cent.The solid Conservative Party win is seen as potentially offering a boost in the form of government spending, while also lifting the clouds of political uncertainty.But by far the biggest factor affecting growth is Brexit and trade deal prospects, which remain far from certain as Mr Johnson has signalled he will seek to pass legislation that could cause a cliff-edge Brexit at the end of 2020.George Brown at Investec said: “A no-deal Brexit could still manifest itself as soon as the end of next year, whereas a re-escalation in the US-China trade dispute cannot be ruled out.”Despite this caution, Investec still believes rates will be lifted to 1 per cent in mid-2021.Howard Archer, chief UK economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the outlook for the economy in 2020 will once again see Brexit as the deciding factor and the Bank may need to take action if growth remains in the doldrums.And with inflation remaining well below the Bank’s 2 per cent target – at 1.5 per cent in November – there is room to do so if necessary.Mr Archer said: “If the UK economy fails to show clear signs of picking up in the early months of 2020, pressure will clearly mount on the Bank of England to trim interest rates to provide support.“Pressure for lower interest rates could also mount if the economy continues to be hampered by concerns over the UK’s longer-term relationship with the EU and what will happen at the end of 2020 when the transition arrangement will be due to end.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence.A person resembling Mr Ghosn entered Beirut’s Rafic al-Hariri International Airport under a different name after flying in on a private jet, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, citing an unidentified Lebanese security official.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

Mr Musk said the tunnel will “hopefully be fully operational in 2020”, and would be the first of many tunnel networks beneath cities in the future.“The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well,” he tweeted on Sunday. “If we don’t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBy drastically reducing the cost and time it takes to bore tunnels, the firm claims to offer\u0026nbspa radical new option that does not interfere with existing transport infrastructure. Cars and passenger pods would be pinged along electric skates through tunnels at speeds of up to\u0026nbsp155mph, before lifts return them to the surface.“The key to making this work is increasing tunnelling speed and dropping costs by a factor of 10 or more – this is the goal of The Boring Company,” the company’s website states.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

This is not in place of other solutions, eg light rail, but supplemental to them.”A spokesperson for The Boring Company was not immediately available for comment but the Las Vegas and Visitors Authority told CNN that the tunnel would be ready in time for the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, which takes place in January.“We just broke ground mid-November and have its anticipated completion for the\u0026nbspCES\u0026nbsp2021 show,” a spokesperson said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instagram doesn’t offer the feature, however, so you will have to go elsewhere.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThankfully, you don’t have to pick through all your pictures and find out the best ones: there’s plenty of websites available to do that for you. The best one appears to be topnine.co, which includes some extra features like the ability to see how many likes you managed to get over the entire year.Last year, that site ran into issues\u0026nbspin some countries, such as the UK,\u0026nbspperhaps because of more stringent privacy rules. Those seem to have been fixed this time.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost. You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load. Go to your profile, tap the three dots in the top right corner, open Cellular Data Use and choose Use Less Data.411 See your LikesIt’s easy to lose track of your friends’ old posts on Instagram, but if you know you Liked it, you’ll be able to track it down easily. Just go to your profile, hit the three dots at the top and select Posts You’ve Liked. You can also save posts in a folder only you can see by tapping the bookmark icon underneath it. Take a look at everything you’ve bookmarked by tapping the same icon that sits near the top of your profile.Everyone knows you can expand the reach of your posts by using a number of relevant hashtags, but what those are aren’t always glaringly obvious. You can easily find the right ones for you by typing a keyword into Instagram’s search bar, selecting a hashtag from the list and swiping along the Related row that appears at the top of the screen.611 Clear your search historyWhatever your reasons are, you can clear your recent searches by going to your profile, hitting the three dots in the top right and selecting Clear Search History. To go a step further and hide your Suggested searches too, go to the search page, tap and hold the account you want to hide, and choose Hide from the pop-up window.Tagged photos on Instagram aren’t as prominent as they are on Facebook, but anyone can still browse through other people’s pictures of you by visiting your profile and tapping the photo of you icon. If you’re tagged in a picture you don’t want other people to see, go to your profile, hit the photos of you icon, tap the three dots at the top of the screen and choose Hide Photos.811 Secure your accountMake your Instagram account much harder to hack by enabling two-factor authentication, a security feature that protects you even if your login details are stolen. Go to your profile, tap the three dots, open Two-Factor Authentication and toggle it on.911 Share lots at onceIf you want to upload a bunch of related pictures and videos without flooding everyone else’s feed, you can shared them all as one post. Hit the + icon, select Gallery, choose Select Multiple, pick out up to 10 of the pictures and clips you want, tap Next and reorder them by dragging and dropping.Instagram Stories has been a massive hit since it came out last year, but you might not know that you can record Stories clips without having to hold one of your digits on the record key. On the Stores screen, just swipe through the options at the bottom until you get to Hands-Free. Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them. Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  But if there are problems, you can still head\u0026nbspto the 2019bestnine site\u0026nbspas an alternative. It’s not quite as neat, runs quite slowly and sticks a fairly ugly watermark on the bottom, but it includes some clever features, such as the ability to choose any date range that you like.Whichever one you use, just head to that site, give it your username, and it’ll sort everything out from there. You can even give it someone else’s username, should you want to see their best nine.​Instagram’s latest update forces new users to reveal their ageThe site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.​The feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you’re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn’t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you’ve locked it down you won’t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram’s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren’t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.A version of this article was first published in 2018Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They know you are a fan.”Ms Reynolds told Mr Major he would be in good company, with the likes of Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and Jacques Chirac all due to attend.The aide also told Mr Major it would be his last chance to see the Olympics, with the 2000 Sydney Games being too far away to justify a visit, although she did suggest him attending the Athens Games in 2004.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan.

Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade.

He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child.

All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so.

He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care?

Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life.

How low-carbon can you go  Reduce meat and dairy consumption, as beef and sheep livestock have a high carbon footprint. If you’re not ready to go completely without, try Meat Free Mondays Grow your own: You don’t need a big garden. Salad leaves, chilli and herbs are just a few of the things that grow well in containers. It’s a low-cost way of reducing your reliance on super-market fruit and vegetables. Switch off when idle: Leaving TVs, games consoles, the washing machine and microwave on standby eats energy. Some appliances draw energy even when they are not being used and phone chargers are among the worst culprits. “Vampire power” costs each house up to £ a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Use energy-saving lightbulbs: LED bulbs can last up to , hours, while some newer models are good for double that. As they use far less energy, you will quickly see impressive savings on your energy bill each month. Which  magazine puts the annual cost of running an LED lightbulb at £., compared to £. for a CFLtype and £. for halogen. Over the course of an LED bulb’s very long letime, it can save you around £. Be a careful cook: Only use as much water as you need and cover your pans so you save energy. Overfilling your kettle is a waste of electricity so only boil as much as you need. Lose the plastic packaging: This wrapping is energy-intensive in its production and causes serious damage to habitats. Choose items that are light on packaging, and refill as much as possible. There is no reason to buy tomatoes on a plastic tray which is also wrapped in plastic. A loose tomato tastes just as good. Find out more about the supermarkets’ war against plastic. Go low: Set the washing machine at C or even C. Doing the laundry at C instead of C can be one third cheaper on energy. For lightly soiled clothes, try C. And make sure that your machine is full. Get free water-saving devices: Moving water around the country and treating it requires huge amounts of energy, so get in touch with your water company to find out what gadgets you can get for free, such as low-flow shower heads which use less water. Make your home cosy: Draught-proof your doors and windows, install secondary-film glazing, top up your loft insulation to cm and get your boiler serviced. Accord-ing to the Energy Saving Trust, loft insulation for a semi-detached house will cost around £, with £ savings a year, while insulating a mid-terrace house will cost around £ and save £ a year. Turn down radiators in rooms you are not using: You don’t need to heat a room you’re not in, so use radiator controls to adjust temperature. Slow down on fast fashion: We buy more and more clothes each year. So choose vintage items, rent something for those special occasions and don’t forget charity shops. Oxfam has a great online shop. For outfit rentals, try websites like byrotation, hirestreetuk and mywardrobehq. If you do really want to buy new clothes, look out for certications of sustain-ability. Use the Good On You app to find out which shops are reducing their impact on the environment. Watch super-market air miles: Potatoes do not rack up air miles like imported rice. Likewise, dairy has a high carbon footprint, so swap a latte for a regular coffee. Look for the Red Tractor symbol on food supplied by British farmers. Buy strawberries, for example, from Norfolk, not Morocco.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there is still work to do.Top-down control over who gets a chance to be a candidate is demoralising and messy.And they are still outnumbered by Labour’s membership. It’s time to ride the Boris wave and add , new members to the blue ranks.If Labour keep telling themselves Magic Grandad is perfect, and blaming the voters, then this is a chance for the Conservatives to steal a march.WHILE this dwindling decade was stuffed full of exciting political events, it was not a vintage era for decisive majority ­government.There have been thrills — from voters defying Project Fear to free our country from the EU, through to Boris ­Johnson’s crushing victory over Corbynism.And there have been spills — David Cameron’s abrupt exit from power, Theresa May’s loss of her majority, and the hijack of the Labour Party by the far Left. But there have been only a few moments — mere months in the past ten years — of certain, stable, clear government.We have had two hung parliaments, the uncomfortable alliance of the coalition, and a slim Tory majority which was swtly erted by the EU referendum.At Westminster’s worst, a Remainer Commons — helped by a self-indulgent Speaker — trapped a minority Government in office while denying it the power to do anything.It’s all been very entertaining, but entertainment value is not always a sign of great governmentToo often, hung parliaments and paralysed ministers proved unable to make urgent decisions.Important calls were postponed or fudged out of necessity, because the votes to get on with the job were simply not there.Smashing that obstacle to decision-making is one of the many things about the election result to celebrate.Getting Brexit done should only be the start of the changes made by a Government that at last has the chance to be radical and ambitious.Not everybody will be cheering, however. Obviously, the Opposition aren’t happy. And I expect we will soon see some signs of unhappiness from the upper ranks of the civil service, too.Why  First, because theof majority government is a rude intrusion into the lives of civil service chiefs after a decade in which they got used to getting their own way.The absence of clear authority under May, and before that the many tensions and fractures of the coalition years, offered plenty of opportunity for determined mandarins to manage things just as they liked. No longer.Second, because the days in which the civil service was truly neutral, from top to bottom, have sadly ended — and a troubling number of officials seem to feel it is their role to promote a particular view.Brexit has exposed that bias. In the referendum campaign, public bodies which should know better allowed themselves to be used to pump out Remain propaganda, damaging their reputations.The agenda — to try to delay, disrupt and deny Brexit — was obvious. The election result has at last convinced all but the most diehard EU fans that we really are going to leave.But this is not the only issue on which the Government and parts of officialdom disagree.From Michael Gove’s criticism of experts, to Downing Street’s belief that Whitehall is overdue for radical restructuring and reform, there are changes on the way which will disrupt a state of affairs that rather suited a lot of senior people.If the New Year sees whole departments abolished or merged, and a new culture of ministers challenging the sacred cows of Whitehall thinking, then the machine will fight back, hoping to undermine change and keep things the same. There are three ways for ministers and their advisers to defend against that assault.First, steel themselves for a bumpy ride. They’ll be briefed against by past masters of the targeted Whitehall leak who have little to lose. They must not let themselves be knocked off course.Second, they must find allies. For every hidebound part of the civil service, there are others chafing to see things done better. Bring them on board.Third, they should make full use of their power to make public appointments.Labour stuffed the ious quangos and commissions with like-minded people, with similar principles and priorities.Why wouldn’t they  It would be bizarre for a government to appoint its opponents to wield state power against its agenda.And yet that is exactly what the Tories have too often done, apparently through a misguided sense of fair play.It’s time to realise that the other side neverthe favour. Boris and his team know that the election was the start, not the end, of their job.They have to deliver the change that they promised, to fulfil the trust voters put in them. There are battles ahead to make that happen, and wrestling Whitehall will be one of the biggest.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just before we say goodbye to this year, I’ve been thinking about all the brilliant women who did brave, groundbreaking and seriously inspiring things in .Here, in no particular order, are my pick of those who really stood out — and hopefully will continue to do so for some time to come.It’s been a very mixed year for her. The country has had a tumultuous time, going to the polls and with two Prime Ministers.Her grandsons were apparently feuding and she had to be seen to be laying down the law to Prince Andrew.History may well judge  as her second annus horribilis.Yet somehow, this amazing woman has been the very definition of a dignied, strong and steady leader, offering us the stability and reassurance we as a country so desperately need.Yes, I know women’s football has been going on for years.But  was the year our Lionesses put it firmly on the map.Not only that, they have also inspired a generation of girls to get their boots on and play, knowing they can be just as good as boys on the pitch.So although it’s a shame it’s taken this long, we all owe them a debt of gratitude.I have long admired Emily for asking the hard questions on BBC’s Newsnight.But this year, in the face of the extreme hotting-up of Brexit, culminating in December’s General Election, her coverage has been second to none .Then her grilling of Prince Andrew in November was a masterclass in conducting a good interview — clinical, forensic and meticulous, without a hint of deference.Never shouty or confrontational, she gave Andrew the space to show himself to the public so they could make up their own minds about his culpability in his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.She also somehow managed not to make herself the storyalthough when Prince Andrew described Epstein’s actions as “unbecoming”, she took the chance to look as disgusted as we all feel.“Unbecoming ” she said. “He was a sex offender.”In short, she nailed him.That photo of her wearing the world’s most beautul dress, martini and cigarette in hand at the Emmys after-party, said it all.Earlier in the night she had won three of the four Emmys she was up for — just more in a long line of awards and accolades this year, during which she proved the brilliance of Fleabag was not a one-off.Her sharp, witty and totally original writing on Killing Eve showed she is seriously clever as well as unbelievably glamorous.And her portrayal of women is original, transgressive and totally refreshing.No wonder she was drafted in to give her input and perspective on the next Bond movie.I have a feeling that in  we will realise Phoebe Waller-Bridge is only just getting started.She has had her first baby, conducted her first royal tour and guest edited Vogue. Oh, and she met Beyonce.All in all, not a bad year! She has also managed to consistently put on a brave and happy face while on the receiving end of more criticism than most of us could stand.But it is her le-long passion for and commitment to feminism I admire most.On International Women’s Day, she said: “Men can understand that they can be feminists,” and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them.As we know all too well, not everyone likes a strong woman. But because she is strong, my view is that she will win over her critics in the end.Leave it to the women to organise, unite and provide support to local women in their community and provide support for those affected by the terrible tragedy of the Grenfell fire.Their aim is to provide a networking  and discussion forums for women and arrange positive actions and initiatives that will help the community. But above all, they want to remember — which is why they organise a monthly silent walk in memory of their “lost angels”.My heart breaks for them that they have to do this.But what a brilliant reminder of the power of organisation and women coming together to support each other.Earlier this year, at an equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by the TV and radio presenter, Samira said she: “Could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work . . .“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”On behalf of every woman who has felt she should have said something, should have done something, should have spoken out, stood up or walked out when they knew they were being paid less than men in similar roles, but who felt they had no choice but to put up with it, I salute her.I also want to give a mention to the captain of the US women’s soccer team.Yes, she is a great player. But people have lined up to criticise her because she is another strong woman who seems genuinely not to care what people think of her and what she says.They describe her in the US as a “badass” and there is no doubt that she is outspoken on every issue going.But it is her ongoing campaign to normalise gay relationships in sport that really resonates with me.Working in a sport where no male has ever come out as gay while playing in the Premier League, it seems sad — and unacceptable — that people can’t be open about being gay.I think Megan is helping to change that, though.Asked in an interview how it felt to lead the US team, she replied: “Go gays!”She continued: “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team. It’s never been done before. Ever.”Could any collection of amazing women be complete without a mention of the -year-old schoolgirl who has started an international revolution Everything this young woman has done — and she has done more than anyone I can think of to raise awareness about the climate emergency — has been made so much more impressive because of her tenacity in the face of such extreme criticism.Most of the youngster’s critics seem to be men of a certain age who are, I guess, threatened by someone so young and female being so bold, opinionated and unconcerned about what they think.Amazingly, the insults and attacks seem only to have empowered her further and fuelled her determination to make the world listen to what we need to do to try to stop climate change in its tracks.A slip of a girl — and a teen at that — is changing the world.Bravely, and in the face of extreme confrontation at times, she has created a movement where millions around the world follow her and listen to her.She has turned down many accolades because she is not in it for the adulation. She really just wants to make change happen. Truly inspirational.A bit like female Prime Ministers, female newspaper editors are a rarer breed than male ones.Women have such an important role to play in journalism and in fighting for equality.And now, for the first time in  years, there will be a female editor of the Financial Times, which really is groundbreaking, given the paper has been such a bastion of male power for so long.Roula is going to do a magnicent job, not least because she is so focused on increasing newsroom ersity and attracting more female readers, which gives her an obvious spot among my Women of the Year.And a final mention must go to Dr Nyla Raja, purely for personal reasons.She has transformed my skin this year.Everyone needs a great facial and a little help . . . and boy, does she deliver!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg, Sue Perkins: “To try and track down a dim and distant Irish relative, so I can finally get that passport.” Any progress BEST THROUGH THE KEYHOLE GUEST: Jimmy Carr after the cameras had nosed round Joey Essex’s house: “He’s got a in TV and no bookshelves.

Sooner or later that debt is paid.”WORST DRAMA: Contenders included: Deep Water, Cleaning Up with Sheridan Smith, Sanditon, The Widow featuring Kate Beckinsale and her mysterious self-cleaning T-shirt, Rob Lowe’s Lincolnshire-based police drama Wild Bill , a very right-on War Of The Worlds, BBC’s appalling woke World War Two drama World On Fire and Russell T Davies’s leap-into-the-future series Years And Years, which came with the stark warning that not only will Donald Trump start a nuclear war, but Have I Got News For You will still be going in .Not even that travesty, though, was quite as bad as ITV’s attempt to replace Downton Abbey with Beecham House and all the self-loathing Empire guilt and trenchcoats that went with that disaster.THOSE naughty people at Good Morning Britain who got Charlotte Hawkins to sit above the words: “CYCLONE FANI BATTERS INDIA.”WORST DRAMA PERFORMANCE: Either Brian “Jimmy McCavern” Gleeson attempting a Glaswegian accent on Peaky Blinders or Tom Bateman, the poor sod in the Indiana Jones outfit on Beecham House.HARDEST SELL OF THE YEAR: This Morning : “Celine Dion’s beauty tips.

I spoke to him about three months ago and he was a bit down about it all.A family member today told The Sun Online Joey, a dad of a nine-year-old boy, had been diagnosed with cancer but was given the all clear before his death.She said: He was waiting for a letter to seeit had come back orhe had the all clear.They told the family it was all clear but they thought maybe he was lying to not hurt them.They have since found the letter and he did have the all clear. No one can get their heads around it.She added: Theres questions that are never going to be answered. Its a torment.Family members said they had previously flagged concerns the pair were struggling with depression.The family of the Big Fat Gypsy Wedding stars also claimed that a note was found by the pairs body on Saturday, saying they wanted it like this.Phoebe Charleen Smith, a cousin, told the : Joey had cancer, and Billy told him I’d never be able to live without you.Joey told the family he got the all-clear after chemo two months ago, but we don’t knowthat’s true now.They went missing, and Joey’s phone was turned off. Then we found a note. It said that they wanted it like this, and we would find them in the woods where they played with the family years ago.Tragically, just two weeks before their death, the brothers had been filmed singing and dancing to Mariah Careys All I Want for Christmas Is You.The brothers had first featured on Channel  throughout .One episode followed them during a gardening sht in Kent, where they discussed the traveller lestyle before getting married.But friends and family have been left reeling by the deaths, with police closing the lane in an isolated area of Sevenoaks, Kent, following the incident.Bouquets of flowers, including pink roses, have been laid at the scene where the twins are thought to have taken their own lives, which is around half a mile from Joe’s home.Among tributes paid to the twins, Billys partner Kristina, from Cheltenham, wrote on Facebook: Hardest day of my le.

We accept what happened but the process that led to this verdict was unjust.Rather than a simplistic suicide verdict, we wanted a narrative verdict which would act as an official record saying that while it was likely a suicide, they could not be  per cent certain because there are factors which suggest otherwise.Ian Singleton, assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, told the inquest that the death of -year-old Kelly could not be a cry for help because the location was so isolated that no-one would have seen her.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the Samaritanson  or   .The CCTV on the train was, unusually, not working, so the drivers vivid description of Kellys final moments is the main witness account of how she died.But Mr Stooke said: There are far more isolated bridges along the railway line and there are cars flowing across that one all the time, so I believe Kelly hoped someone would notice her climbing over the parapet and have her taken into a secure facility.The driver was in shock, and we dont blame him, so he may not be  per cent certain about what he saw.Plus, Kelly only had a few cuts and abrasions, and no skull fractures, after being hit - the damage should have been much greater.Maybe she tried to get out of the way but it was too late.Testimony from a mental health consultant and Kellys GP revealed that she had talked about suicidal thoughts similar to how she later died. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And levelling up by helping ordinary working people deal with the cost of living.Lower paid workers are crucial to our economy, whether carers for our elderly and disabled relatives, hospitality staff ensuring we have a great festive season or manufacturers producing world-class goods. Many of them were working over Christmas instead of being sat down and relaxed with loved ones.Because we’ve been responsible in managing the economy, employment is at record high. But this Government is also focused on helping people make their money go further and giving you and your family a better quality of le.In , we introduced the National Living Wage, which gave British workers their biggest pay rise in nearly two decades.I believe the best possible start to  for millions of hard-working people on lower wages is to give them a pay rise. So that is exactly what we are doing, by increasing the National Living Wage by an inflation-busting .% to £. - £ a year extra - for a full-time worker from April. I look back and think what a dference that percentage wage rise would have made for my parents.It’s the largest ever cash increase - proving that hard work does pay under this Government.But I am not stopping there. I confirmed last autumn that we had the ambition to end low pay over the next five years by setting a target for the NLW to reach two-thirds of average earnings in the coming years.And as well as paying more, we want more people to benefit. The NLW currently kicks in on your twenty fth birthday, but we want younger generations too to be able to secure good jobs, save towards a home and achieve their dreams. So while this year minimum wage rates for those workers, including apprentices, will also increase between .% and .%, I have announced plans to ensure that the highest rate is extended to workers aged  and over in , and to those aged  and over within five years.We know these rises must be paid for – so we’re being ambitious but responsible. We are carefully building our approach to ending low pay so jobs are protected with increases that businesses can plan for, while we invest in our public services so resource isn’t erted from the frontline to cover workforce pay.Getting Brexit done doesn’t just mean passing legislation, to me it means helping people so that they know the country works for them. So  will be the year of levelling up, because we are greater together than the sum of our parts. Happy New Year.Boris Johnson also said the move helps correct the injustice of “for too long, people haven’t seen the pay rises they deserve”.The PM added: “As we enter a new decade, we’re setting our sights higher, to help people earn more over the next five years and level up access to opportunity across our great country”.Younger workers will also get wage boosts, with the rate for - year olds going up by .% from £. to £. an hour.There is a .% increase for - year olds, from £. to £., and a .% increase from £. to £. for under s.Since the National Living Wage was introduced in , the nation’s lowest paid who do a  hour week will have had a wage increase of £,.After years of “Spreadsheet Phil”and his Brexit fearmongering, this is exactly the boost Britain needs — both for the economy and spirit.So let’s join the three million who’ll be toasting Mr Javid on New Year’s Eve. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This makes them a desirable option for couples who want to legally recognise their relationship but dont have a particular religion.There is also no exchanging of vows, no recognised religious leader carrying out the ceremony and no singing of hymns at a civil partnership.Instead, couples sign the civil partnership document and become known as civil partners - rather than husband and we.Dissolving a civil partnership is similar to marriage but adultery cannot be used as a reason for ending the relationship.Julie and Keith met  years ago while working as journalists but made the decision not to tie the knot because they saw it as traditionally being rooted in patriarchy and religion.She said: We have had a very successful relationship for  years and a bit of paper is not going to make any dference to that whatsoever.While Keith added: As a man, I think it is absolutely crucial that we stand up against this long-standing domination by men over womens rights, and we need to do something about it.I am playing my small part in that.And Ann Chamings and partner John Eccles — together for  years — will tie the knot at Hastings Town Hall today.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The villagers hope that ancestral spirits keep them safe from evil interference, pests which threaten to destroy local crops, and also general misfortunes.In addition to changing corpses’ clothing, this ritual is also followed by the ritual of slaughtering buffaloes and pigs as a form of offering.“This tradition is believed to have been in the Toraja tribe for generations and has been going on for thousands of years.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBetween Brexit, the election and a new prime minister, itaposs been a long and confusing year in politics. Rules, benefit systems - even the date weaposre going to leave the EU - have been repeatedly chopped and changed. And many of the changes made to our laws and budgets donapost take effect immediately. Most will involve some lead time before the changes come into force - so itaposs easy to forget whataposs coming up. So weaposve rounded up  of the major changes to UK law, benefits, financial and employment rules that are set to take place in . They include increases to the minimum wage, new rights for gig economy workers and changes to the laws on gay marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland. Read on to see how theyaposll affect you and your family. January : Rail fares rise by .% Rail fares are to jump by an average of .% as the latest inflation-linked hike kicks in. Some long-distance commuters will see the annual cost of getting to work increase by more than £ on  January. It means a £, season ticket will rise by £., while a London to Guildford annual ticket, which typically costs £, will rise by £ to £,. January : Gay marriage is legalised in Northern Ireland Northern Irelandaposs ban on same-sex marriage will officially come to an end, after Westminster politicians stepped in and changed the law. Although the weddings will be legal from this date, bureaucracy means the first civil same-sex marriages are expected to take place on the week of Valentineaposs Day. March : Alcohol minimum pricing launches in Wales The Welsh Government is planning on a new law setting minimum alcohol prices, WalesOnline reports. Currently set to come into force on March , , ministers want retailers and bars to charge a minimum of p per unit - meaning a can of cider could cost at least £ and a bottle of wine, £.. Health minister Vaughan Gething confirmed the start date in a statement to Assembly members in October. However, the regulations which will set out the timetable and minimum prices, still need to be approved by the Welsh Assembly. The policy has already been delayed from last summer. March : The right to request decent affordable broadband Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses have the choice of slow broadband, hideously expensive broadband, or no broadband. Thataposs set to end for many with a new right called the Universal Service Obligation. From March , anyone can request a connection that can deliver  megabits per seconddownload speed and  Mbps upload speed and costs less than £ per month. If you donapost have internet of this quality, you have the legal right to request it, as long as the installation would cost less than £,. If it costs more, you can still have broadband installed but may have to pay the excess cost. The scheme is being administered by BT and KCOM in Hull. Once a request is made, there are set standards for how quickly they must assess and deliver on requests. March : Abortion is made legal in Northern Ireland From the end of March, women in Northern Ireland will be allowed to terminate pregnancies without fear of prosecution. That means the region will be brought in line with the rest of the UK by the beginning of April. The change was approved by the UK Parliament as part of the Northern IrelandBill - introducing the law in the absence of the collapsed devolved government. From April, abortion services will be available from two hospitals. Buffer zones will be in place to prevent protests outside the centres. Itaposs thought around , will take place each year in Northern Ireland. April : Councils can double council tax for empty homes  Property owners can already face Council Tax bills increasing by %they leave properties vacant for more than two years. And from April, that figure increases to % - potentially doubling the charge for homes left empty for long periods of time.  April : Hospital parking charges axed - for some Hospital parking charges for thousands of NHS patients and staff will be scrapped in England from April . Blue badge holders, frequent outpatients and parents of sick kids are among the groups that will benefit from the Tory pledge - which comes after a long Mirror campaign. But not all NHS staff and patients will get free parking, as they would have done under Labouraposs plans. Instead of being scrapped altogether, the £m-a-year paid to park at NHS hospitals will be scaled back by just under a third, saving patients and staff up to £m a year. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would prioritise those with the greatest need adding: One of the concerns mentioned regularly on the doorsteps was that vulnerable people, and staff working nights, have to pay for hospital car parking. So we are today delivering on our manesto commitment and setting out our new approach to NHS hospital parking charges.  Weaposre currently expecting a new rate of £. for those aged  and over, up from £. an hour now, but the exact figure canapost be confirmed yet. New hourly rates for the following April are announced in the Budget, which we are only expecting in February due to delays around the election. April : Changes to rights for agency and gig economy workers Currently, when people who earn ying amounts of money from week-to-week - particularly those on flexible contracts - take a paid holiday, the employer has to pay them holiday pay which equates to the average weekly wage they earned over the  weeks before that holiday. From April , , that is changing. Employers will have to calculate the average weekly wage from an entire year -  weeks - rather than just  weeks. The reform is intended to improve the holiday pay for seasonal workers, who tend to lose out over the way it is currently calculated. Written statement Employers will also be required to provide a aposstatement of particularsapos on day one of employment - which must include:Hours and days of the week the worker employee is required to work, whether they may be ied and how Entitlements to paid leave Details of any probationary period Details of training provided by the employerParental bereavement leave Way back in , the Government backed a Private Members bill which proposed giving workers the right to unpaid leave of up to two weeks, as a right, from day one of their employment, should they suffer the tragedy of their child dying under the age of . This became law in September, , and is expected to come into force in early . While most employers do give discretionary compassionate leave in such tragic circumstances, some do not. This law, which also applies to women who suffer a stillbirth or miscarriage from the th week of pregnancy, changes that. April : National Insurance is cut by up to £ a year The Tories pledged to raise national insurance thresholds in their manesto. From April, you will pay no national insurance contributions on the first £, of your earnings - up from £, at the moment - working out as a saving of around £ a year.The move has been criticised for falling short of the £-a-year Boris Johnson promised, and only helping better earners who are already over the threshold.For others itaposs not quite the all out win you might think - with the move meaning some of the worst off might now miss out on some of their state pension as a result. Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: “Under current rules, those not paying any NI lose out on credits towards their state pension. Iniduals need  years of qualying NICs to receive the full state pension with those with fewer qualying years seeing a reduction and receive nonethey have fewer than  years of credits.” April : Tories will let families inherit £million tax free - finishing what George Osborne started Families will be able to pass £m of their wealth without Inheritance Tax when they die. Currently someone who dies can leave £, of their estate tax-free. But Tory George Osborne added an extra extra tax-free amount that applies only to property. In April this extra portion rises from £, to £, - meaningsomeone owns a home, they can leave £, tax free. This doublesa couple is married. April : Student loan repayments will fall  People paying back student loans get a minor tax break in April too. Recent graduates will be able to earn £, a year before payments kick in - up from £, this year. That should save them £. in payments a year. People who graduated between  and  will see their threshold rise too - from £, a year to £,. April : State pension will rise by .% The state pension will rise by .% from April - more than double the rate of inflation. Such an increase means pensioners can expect an rise of just over £ per week on the New State Pension from the current rate of £.. But hundreds of thousands of over-s will see around half their pension rise wiped out by the cost of paying for their own TV licence, after the benefit was scrapped. Tory ministers pledged to protect the state pension with a apostriple lockapos. That means it rises by inflation, .% or average earnings - whichever is highest. Average weekly earnings rose by .% in the year to May to July . April : Benefit freeze ends After almost a decade of freezes and caps, about . million people on Universal Credit and millions more on legacy benefits will get a .% increase in April. The increase means someone on £ a month in benefits will get an extra £.. But it is less than the rise in average earnings and less than the rise in pensions. April: Council tax to rise Local authorities will get the power to raise council tax by up to % from April - % for general spending and % for social care. Thataposs worth an extra £ to on the average band D council tax home in England. Council-by-council rises will only be confirmed in February and March. June : The end of free TV Licences for over s TV Licences are free for over s, but from June  youaposll only get oneyouaposre receiving Pension Credit. Around million households are set to be affected.BBC chairman David Clementi said:“Copying the current scheme was ultimately untenable.But the Tories were slammed for breaking their promise to protect the benefit by handing over responsibility for it to the BBC. July or later: Millions will start being moved onto Universal Credit The limited pilot scheme for migrating existing benefit claimants onto Universal Credit is set to finish by July  and begin rolling out across the country shortly after. Current plans suggest it will take until  until the system is fully up and running. From July claimants moving from Income Support, income based Jobseekeraposs Allowance and Employment Support Allowance will get an extra two weeks of support from their old benefit while they transition onto Universal Credit. October : The state pension age will finish rising to  From October youaposll need to be at least  to get a state pension - whatever your gender. The age people can at has been rising for years - starting with increasing womenaposs state pension age until it matched menaposs, then increasing both from  to . AJ Bell analyst Tom Selby said: “The rise started incrementally in  and is scheduled to complete by October . That means anyone born after  October  will have a state pension age of at least . Itaposs not the last time it will rise though. The Conservatives have set out plans to increase the state pension age again to  by  and  by , Selby added.

These are just some of the fascinating details revealed this week in official documents from the s and aposs, newly declassied by National Archives in Dublin and London. The files were released under the  year rule -  years in Ireland - which requires secret documents to be declassied after two decades unless there is a good reason not to. UK documents are revealed by the National Archives at Kew unless they would cause damage to the countryaposs image, national security or foreign relations. In the UK, documents are released twice a year in August and January - but theyaposre still playing catch-up with declassications, after the time limit was reduced from  years to  in . Hereaposs a round-up of the most interesting stories that emerged in this yearaposs releases. . Nuclear weapons could be hidden inside a Northern Ireland mountain  Nuclear weapons could be sited at underground facilities inside a mountain in Northern Ireland, Dublin’s most senior intelligence official advised the government. Colonel L Buckley, then Ireland’s Director of Intelligence, was asked for a briefing for Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter Barry on the possibility of nuclear missiles being on the island in November . In a response marked “Confidential”, Buckley complains that he doesn’t have “the monitoring or surveillance systems” to confirm the movements of UK ships, aircraft and support systems. “Suffice to say any such information would be given the highest security classication and only be available to UK or or other military personnel on the strictest ‘need-to-know’ basis at the highest level,” he added.  But he said the harbour at Sydenham in Belfast could accommodate Royal Navy or Nato ships “equipped with nuclear missiles or weapons”. And he said a military base at Benbradagh Mountain,overlooking Dungiven in Co Derry, the second highest mountain in the Sperrins which was used by US forces during the Cold War to communicate with its north Atlantic fleet, could hold nuclear weapons. “Ben Bradaigh NEof Dungiven has underground facilities, which were originally constructed by US forces for the storage of conventional high explosives but were subsequently redesigned and are understood to be suitable for the storage of nuclear weaponsso required,” he wrote.  Margaret Thatcher “grabbed her handbag” and “stormed out” of a meeting with the Belgian prime minister in a row over the extradition of an Irish priest wanted in London over alleged connections to the IRA A senior Tory adviser told an Irish diplomat about the incident by way of contrasting Thatcher’s “quite natural” way with then Irish Taoiseach Charlie Haughey, adding there was “a lot to be played for between them”.  . Thatcher kept wrongly convicted Birmingham Six in jail to dodge scandal The Thatcher government was reluctant to free the Birmingham Six because of pressure from Tory hardliners and concerns it would cause a “scandal”. A Home Office official admitted the fears to Irish diplomats  years ago. The Irish government was leaned on not to pursue their case with the European Court of Human Rights. PM Margaret Thatcher’s government also feared a backlash from the media. Paddy Hill, Gerry Hunter, Johnny Walker, Hugh ­Callaghan, Richard McIlkenny and Billy Power were freed in  for one of the worst miscarriages of justice after being ly convicted in  for the Birmingham pub bombings that killed  people in November .  . Thatcheraposs fury over aposher boysapos killed in Northern Ireland Margaret Thatcher had warned Northern Ireland’s police chief that she would no longer send “her boys over in waves to be killed” in a rancorous row over who was to blame for the slaughter of eight soldiers in an IRA bomb. Sir John Hermon, then chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, was upset by the “neo-colonial connotations” and “World War I overtones” of the Prime Minister’s dressing down, which he took as distancing of herself from the region, newly declassied files disclose. The IRA detonated a massive roadside bomb, containing  pounds of semtex, as an unmarked bus carrying members from the Light Infantry made its way along the A at Ballygawley, Co Tyrone, after midnight on August , . Eight soldiers - all aged between  and  - were killed and another  were injured. They had been making their way from the airport to their base at Omagh. Six months later, Sir John confided in a diplomat about the “panic reaction” from Downing Street in the wake of the attack as well as tensions between the police and the army over whose fault it was for the deadly security lapse.  . Tory who avoided aposblacks and Irishapos feared for apossecurity implicationsapos of allowing Irish MPAn aposunsavouryapos Tory MP who openly admitted avoiding the blacks and Irish in his constituency feared the security implications of allowing Irish politicians into Westminster .Nicholas Budgen, who took over Enoch Powell’s House of Commons seat for Wolverhampton South West, agreed to have lunch with Richard Ryan, a diplomat in the Irish Embassy in London, in March , a report of the meeting marked “confidential” shows. Ryan was trying to bolster support - and stymie opposition - to the nascent British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, made up of politicians in London and Dublin. . Officials feared John Major would have to aposhide behind plantapos as Bill Clinton visited UK  Officials feared the Prime Minister would be forced to hide behind a pot plant to avoid shaking a Sinn Fein leaderaposs hand. Aides were worried about a chance meeting between PM John Major and Sinn Feinaposs Gerry Adams during US President Bill Clintonaposs trip to the UK. The American President visited London and Belfast in November . Stormont aide Robert Crawford issued the alert for potential embarrassment in a memo to Mr Majoraposs private secretary, Edward Oakden. Mr Crawford wrote: Sinn Feinwill almost certainly be invited to the reception. “We cannot see a way of the Prime Minister avoiding Gerry Adams without reverting to the undignied hiding-behind-the-potted plants scenario, which creates almost as valuable a news story as the first handshake.  Ministers were accused of “manipulating” the grieving Dunblane community in the aftermath of the massacre of  children and their teacher. Parents of youngsters gunned down by murderer Thomas Hamilton demanded an urgent clarication from Prime Minister John Major days after the  tragedy, amid fears the Government was about to U-turn on a pledge to help, a newly-released letter reveals. Relatives were angered by reports Scottish Minister Michael Forsyth was abandoning a pledge to offer taxpayersapos money to rebuild the gym where Hamilton slaughtered five and six-year-olds. The PM and Mr Forsyth were among a delegation to visit the Scottish town after the March  attack. Mr Major confirmed to the headteacher that finding Government cash for the project would not be a problem. Gerry McDermott, spokesman for the school board of governors, said the gesture was a source of great comfort to the community, relieving strain from those most closely involved.  John Major skipped seeing Britainaposs only gold medal of the  Olympics because he wanted to watch cricket instead, official records suggest. Aides to the then Prime Minister tried to persuade him to fly to the US to attend the Atlanta Games. Plans included watching the final of the coxless pairs rowing, featuring Matthew Pinsent and Steve Redgrave, which delivered Britainaposs only gold medal at the Games. But cricket fan Mr Major pulled out of a three-night trip to America at the end of July, despite months of organisation behind the scenes, amid concerns from aides he would go to Englandaposs match with Pakistan. Downing Street private secretary Rachael Reynolds wrote to the PM saying: I understand that you are thinking of staying here for the Lordaposs Test in preference to going to the Olympics. “While having to declare certain personal interest here ... I do think it would be a pityyou were to give up going entirely.”  . Heathrow nearly had its name changed to pay tribute to Winston Churchill John Major considered renaming Heathrow Airport after Sir Winston Churchill. The then Prime Minister believed the idea of making Britain’s biggest airport a memorial to the Second World War leader was “intriguing”. The Tory leader asked senior Whitehall aides to explore the proposal after London businessman Harvey Spack suggested Sir Winston Churchill Airport was better than “stupid” Heathrow. The premieraposs reply to Mr Spack said: “Thank you for your letter of  September and for your intriguing idea about renaming Heathrow airport after Sir Winston Churchill. “I am looking into this, and I am grateful to you for raising it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour demands 10 hour minimum","story":"NewsLabour demands £ an hour minimum wage as Boris Johnsons rise falls shortShadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood calls for a bigger wage hike for all workers - not just over sShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video jeremy-corbyn-pledges--hour-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics labour-demands--hour-minimum-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mr Corbyn was blasted just weeks into his premiership in  for failing to sing the National Anthem during a service at St Paulaposs Cathedral to mark the th anniversary of the Battle of Britain.The sight of the Labour leader remaining silent and refusing to join in triggered a huge row over patriotism.Party sources were forced to pledge he would sing along in future.

But, as he prepares to step down in March having lost this monthaposs general election as Boris Johnson scooped an -seat majority, he insisted: “We’re up for the fight, to protect what we hold dear and to build to win and to transform.“The fight continues - there is no other choice.” He said the “period ahead could not be more important” as he highlighted climate change and poverty as issues facing the world and the country. “It will be crucialwe are to stop irreversible damage being caused by the climate crisis and the particular effects that has on people in the global south,we are to stop the pain plaguing our country - food banks, poverty and people struggling to get by,we are to protect our precious NHS,” he said. “It won’t be easy. But we have built a movement, we are the resistance to Boris Johnson. “We will be campaigning every day, we will be on the frontline, both in Parliament and on the streets - protecting our public services, protecting healthcare free at the point of use, protecting our communities, in all their brilliant ersity, and standing up for internationalism, global solidarity and co-operation, and working with movements and parties seeking social justice and change all over the world.”  Mr Corbynaposs message came hours after one of the candidates vying to succeed him, Remain-supporting Clive Lewis, said the party leader hampered Labouraposs Brexit policy in the general election campaign.Shadow Treasury Minister Mr Lewis, who has formally entered the race for the top job, attacked the outgoing chief over the partyaposs EU position. He told the BBC: “One of the key USPsof Jeremy Corbyn is that he was an authentic politician I genuinely believe that he was. “But on the biggest political crisis of British modern politics, he – we – were unable via Jeremy to be able to take a position. “I think actually we should have stood our ground.” The bookiesapos favourite for the top role, Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, finally admitted she is considering a tilt yesterday.  She confirmed she could throw her hat into the ring with a pledge to champion progressive patriotism. Party chairman Ian Lavery claimed he too could launch a bid for the premiership. He was understood to be discussing a potential bid with his family. But Chesterfield MP Toby Perkins tweeted: “Don’t be fooled by this. “It’s purely an attempt to convince us all that RLB is not a far left choice. “He won’t really stand, she will.” So who are Labouraposs lead singers  Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said: “Yes, of course - and I’ve been especially proud to sing our anthem when representing the Labour Party on behalf of Jeremy at events where Her Majesty has been present.She has dedicated her le to representing and serving our country, and as she grows older, the words of ‘God Save The Queen’ become ever more poignant. So when I sing the anthem these days, I do it not just with pride and passion, but also a feeling of emotion about Her Majesty personally.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: “Yes, I do sing the National Anthem.“Being British is about celebrating our shared values, what we have built together - like our NHS - and the determination we all have to build a more equal, tolerant society.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sir john major nearly renamed","story":"NewsSir John Major nearly renamed Heathrow Airport in memory of Winston ChurchillNewly released records reveal the then-Prime Minister said the idea of renaming Britains biggest airport for the WWII leader was \"intriguing\"ShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  DEC NewsThe PM considered changing the name in  \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - politicsSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The premieraposs reply to Mr Spack said: “Thank you for your letter of  September and for your intriguing idea about renaming Heathrow airport after Sir Winston Churchill. “I am looking into this, and I am grateful to you for raising it.” The businessman had written to Mr Major in September  during the dying days of the PMaposs seven-year-premiership. Mr Spack said: “This is an old hobby horse of mine, but I think it is appropriate timing for you to take such an act and I think would be superb PR. “New York has Kennedy Airport, Paris has De Gaulle and we have the stupid name of Heathrow! “It should be renamed with the name of the greatest man of the century, who has no truly great memorial in our country, the Winston Churchill Airport or Churchill Airport. He added: “I can only see this as a tremendous boost to the ‘feel food factor’ for all of us.” He addresses the Prime Minister “Dear John” and asks about a recent holiday in France he took with we Norma, saying he heard it was “amazing”.

He also said the money from working for the council wasnapost enough to pay his debts so he had to get another job. I spoke to him about three months ago and he was a bit down about it all.

A judge ruled the -year-old woman had invented claims she had been raped by up to  Israeli tourists in a hotel room in Ayia Napa. The teen, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was not surprised by the judgement. Judge Michaelis Andreas Papathanasiou claimed the Brit had made up the allegation because she felt embarrassed after discovering she had been filmed while having sex. He also rejected her claim that Cypriot police officers pressured her into withdrawing her rape allegation. The teenager was convicted of public mischief. The teen told The Sun: “There was, sadly, no surprise at the judgment. She added: “I am entirely dedicated to seeking true justice — and not just for my case. “I have been contacted by many who have been through similar experiences. This fight is for them and many more who have been forced to remain silent.”  The British government said it was deeply worried about her conviction amid claims she had not got a fair trial. A Foreign Office spokesman said: “The UK is seriously concerned about the fair trial guarantees in this deeply distressing case and we will be raising the issue with the Cypriot authorities.” The teen and her mum left court together, both wearing masks with stitched lips on them, in protest over the allegedly unfair trial.  Her mother claimed in an interview with ITV News: Itaposs a bit of a nightmare. I find myself kind of unable to believe the violations of human rights sheaposs experienced throughout the whole affair, particularly things like having no access to lawyers whilst being interrogated for hours on end over a Saturday night. I think thataposs very bizarre. Itaposs also astonishing to me that the Israelis that were originally accused of the crime had legal representation within a matter of hours, whereas my daughter wasnapost offered legal representation at all throughout the whole thing. She asked for a lawyer, didnapost get one... so, absolutely astonishing verdict, really.  The teenager faces up to a year in jail when she is sentenced on January . She is on bail but cannot leave the holiday island, having already been held for around a month in prison on remand. Her mother said: It would be an absolute injusticethey decided to imprison her for any more days, sheaposs already spent four and a half weeks in prison, actually in prison with prisoners that were guilty of crimes and so on, and she has spent nearly six months in Cyprus unable to have any kind of le, any kind of social le.

The Art BB’s misshapen room features a bed with high sides to block access, a toilet door that obstructs the use of the sink and a TV that’s only watchable by looking in the mirror. The nightmare room in Blackpool opened earlier this month andthe mentioned annoyances are not enough to put you off then maybe the bathroom light being behind the shower-head, the curtains not covering the window, the lopsided shelves and the randomly dotted light switches will. It was designed by Leicester-based artist Christopher Samuel who wanted to show people how dficult it is to be disabled and to be placed in accommodation not suitable for a guests needs. It is run by Michael Trainor, from Manchester. He said: Every element of the room is in place to infuriate the guests, you have to hop over the toilet and stand behind the door to use the sink leaving about a foots worth of space. Even using the shower is a nightmare, the soap and shampoo bottles are set upside down so it’s hard to get it out. The building process was a little wonky too. He added: “The builders didn’t understand what was going on, they kept pulling us to one side and telling us the designs were all wrong and the measurements did not add up. “I suppose they’re not used to people telling them that being wrong is exactly how it is supposed to be and were quite baffled by it - we all had a good laugh when seeing the final product.”  Mr Samuel was chosen to design one of the  rooms in the community-funded hotel. The original plan was borne out of his experience of being homeless in , when he was placed in temporary accommodation that had poor access.  Speaking about his experience, he, said: “I couldn’t enter the room normally, use the toilet or even get on the bed, so I just slept on my chair. “I’m really pleased with the room, I think it brings some genuine understanding to people about the dficulties of being disabled in everyday situations.”  Michael added: “We have had a few bookings for this room since we opened last month, people enjoy the idea of it and understand why the room is how it is. “We always let customers know a bit about it but we hide most of the information so it hits them whilst using the room just how annoying it is.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons regret over christmas","story":"NewsKate Middletons regret over Christmas Day outfit telling fan I really shouldnt have worn thisKate Middleton looked gorgeous in a heavy grey Catherine Walker coat, matching her accessories with Princess Charlotte, but she wishes she opted for something  for the Christmas Day celebrationsShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video british-royals-arrive-buckingham-palace-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news kate-middletons-regret-over-christmas-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The teen took a £ MDMA or ecstasy tablet but was unaware it was made up of % rat poison.Now his mum has today told Irish Mirror she feared her son was going to die.But Odi pulled through in hospital and is now back at school part time. Mum Grainne and her husband Alan, from Dundalk, Co Louth, were celebrating a friend’s wedding in London when the call of every parent’s nightmare came through. Just before the first dance, we got a call to say Odi was in the Belfast Mater Hospital in resuscitation and to call them immediately, said the mum-of-three. Seemingly Odi had got himself to a paramedic at the concert and told them he didn’t feel well, that he was a type one diabetic and had taken insulin fteen minutes beforehand. Within three minutes, he started seizing and convulsing. His temperature was  degrees and despite packing him in ice, it remained at  degrees for  hours. We couldn’t get a flight home from London until the next morning so I was in hysterics at the airport all night while Alan was pacing the floors waiting for our hourly updates from the hospital which always told us that Odi wasn’t likely to see the next hour and we probably wouldn’t make it back in time. My -year-old mother Josephine had travelled to the hospital but they wouldn’t let her into intensive care because he was that critically ill.  When they finally reached the hospital the following morning in June, Odi had gone into multi-organ failure. He was hooked up to so many machines which were the only things keeping him alive. He had nothing. No bowels, no kidneys, no liver, no lungs, no heart and no brain. There was no activity. It was our worst nightmare. At the time we didn’t know what had happened but later we found out that Odi had either been given or had taken MDMA at the concert and it took  hours for toxicology to show that it contained % rat poison so our son didn’t stand a hope in hell of making it. Odi was unable to transfer to King’s Hospital in London due to fears he wouldnapost survive the flight. But he was instead brought to St Vincent’s Hospital in Dublin - a centre for excellence for the liver - as medics thoughtthey could just get that vital organ working again, the rest might follow.  Grainne said: There was a vigil for Odi in Dundalk that night and we were watching it on social media. Just as it finished, doctors told us that he was being transferred to Dublin and at that moment, I felt I received my miracle. For  days, Odi was given just a % chance of survival but on the th day, he opened his eyes. He tried to say something and just his expression told me that I had Odi back. However he suffered another setback when diagnosed with an auto-immune disease and the family were further hit by tragedy with the death of Odie’s grandmother Josephine on August . I was on bended knee praying for a miracle for months and I received it but as well, God took the backbone of my family instead.” Odi is still going to rehabilitation and is without the use of his left arm and short term memory, which is why he has been unable to tell Grainne what happened at the concert. I did ask him about what happened that night but he had cerebral oedema and has very little memory. We might never know.

TV news presenters Hannah and Lewis Vaughan Jones spent years battling with infertility. But just before Christmas the pair announced the arrival of Matheson Calon Tallett Vaughan Jones - or Sonny for short - who they described as perfect in every way.Weaposve been through many years of heartache, but weaposve got the best Christmas present at the end of it all, said CNN news anchor Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny on December , Wales Online reports.We have been very public about it for the past three years or so, but in the years before that it was very private and painful - and there was a lot of shame involved which anyone going through infertility will be familiar with. But we have been lucky. We are the very, very lucky ones. Lewis, originally from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said it was harrowing watching his we going through round after round of IVF which involved frequent injections and hormone treatment. We wanted a family, but frankly we didnapost think it was going to happen for us, said Lewis, a freelance news presenter for BBC News and ITV News. In fact, I think weaposd already emotionally moved on. We said to each other that this was going to be our last round [of IVF]. And it was the last little embryo that we had left. Weaposd sent it off for testing and the results came back inconclusive, so we didnapost think it was going to work at all.  But weaposd come this far, so we made the decision to put the embryo back in and, unbelievably, it grew to become Sonny. The couple, who live in Twickenham, said they spent around £, on private IVF treatment after being given one round for free with the NHS. They said the odds of having a baby were severely stacked against them. Weaposd been through so much disappointment and we were emotionally ready to move forward with our lives, said Hannah, . But when the pregnancy test came up as positive I really couldnapost believe it. We didnapost allow ourselves to get too excited in the first  weeks or so until weaposd had the viability scans.  There was huge, huge relief when they said the growth and development was fine. Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny via c-section weighing exactly lb, said there were a few dficult moments during his first few days of le. He lost a lot of weight in the first week which we panicked about. We already thought we were terrible parents and didnapost know how to keep this little human being alive. But heaposs now finally caught up to his birth weight.

The right notes Labour contenders hoping to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as party leader are falling over themselves to be patriotic. This illustrates how much they recognise the party suffered from a perception the outgoing leader didn’t believe in his country. Corbyn insisted during the campaign that he did, but poison spread by his enemies had turned too many voters against him. Rivals for a tarnished Labour crown are echoing Tony Blair and Gordon Brown who, in the party’s successful era, constantly wrapped themselves in the flag. Loudly declaring in today’s Daily Mirror that they sing God Save the Queen is a chorus of politicians serious about winning elections.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShortly before we celebrated the chiming of Big Ben and welcomed , psychic Nicolas Aujula had a number of visions telling him it was going to be a dficult year. The -year-old claims he foresaw earthquakes in China and Cuba, a mass London cabbie protest, a fire at a large historical church and a scandal involving a public figure named Justin - all of which came true. And now, as we prepare to begin a new decade, Nicolas has shared his predictions for  - and itaposs going to be quite a yearheaposs correct. Nicolas, from south London, has been sensing spirits and experiencing supernatural visions since he was a child, and believes he has led past lives as an Egyptian queen and a lion. Nicolas, who works as a past le regression therapist and hypnotherapist, said: “Some of the visions I have are through dreams, and others just hit when I am walking around. “The dreams are the strongest, though, as that’s when you are conked out. The logical side of your brain is switched off, giving more room to your intuitive side.” Explaining some of the predictions that have come to him, he said: “I’ve seen lots of visions of protests – people taking to the streets, not so much just here, but all over the world.  “Of course, people protest all the time, but I’m seeing this more as a global mass movement. “I also feel Trump will be defeated, although he won’t go quietly and have seen visions of severe weather and very heavy winds in the UK.” Nicolas has also had a number of visions relating to the world of showbiz.  He continued: “I’ve had visions of Paris Hilton announcing she is having a baby, a scandal around Lindsay Lohan and Jenner Aniston starting a signicant new relationship. “I’ve also suddenly become very aware of Amy Winehouse, so I wonderthere will be another death of a young female singer in the headlines, perhaps of something surrounding alcohol and addiction. “This one is really bizarre and random, but I’ve seen visions of a floral cupcake dress going viral, and people really sitting up and noticing the design.” Some other notable visions Nicolas has had, which he believes may end up relating to stories that hit the news, include a large fire at a UK hospital, a dog winning a talent show and England enjoying success at a major football tournament – possibly the UEFA Euro tournament, which begins in June. “I don’t follow football, but I can see England doing well in a really big match,” he said.  Over the years, Nicolas believes his visions have helped him predict major world events before they happen. Speaking at the end of  about his forecast for the year ahead, he mentioned seeing earthquakes in China and Cuba, a mass London cabbie protest, a scandal involving a public figure named Justin and singer Taylor Swt getting engaged. “When I look back at , the things I said at the start compared with events that happened throughout are quite eye-opening,” he said. “For example, on June , months after my vision, there was a severe earthquake in Southern China where  people died. “I also talked about cabbies protesting, which they did in the spring at Parliament Square in London. “I’d had visions of someone called Justin getting caught up in a scandal. At the time I wonderedit could be Bieber or Timberlake – but could that have been Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, who was criticised when a picture emerged of him dressed in a turban wearing black makeup .  “With Taylor Swt, there have been rumours swirling since August time so this one is still a waiting game to seeit is true or not. “Earlier this year, I also had a dream where a church was ablaze. It didn’t make sense to me at the time – I just thought it was a random dream so didn’t pay much attention to it. “But about six weeks later, Notre Dame in Paris burnt down. I’d never been there or seen it up close, but when I saw it on the news, I remembered my dream. It felt very surreal, almost like de ja vu.” Nicolas explained how he has possessed a mystic gt ever since he was a child, and would sense his father, who tragically died when he was a baby, nearby. Then, aged , he realised just how powerful his abilities were following an unexplainable experience he had while in a trance-like meditative state. He recalled: “I had this almost out-of-body experience and I was able to see several of my past lives.  “I’d never even thought about them before, and I still can’t explain it to this day. There’s no logic to it, but I knew what I was seeing was me in a previous le. I saw myself as a man, woman, and even an animal.” So moved was Nicolas by the experience that it convinced him to change his path in le, scrapping his plans to study history and economics at university and training instead as a past le regression therapist. “I’ve had thousands of past lives. I’ve been an Egyptian queen, a maid, a teacher in the French revolution, a deer, a lion and even lived in another universe,” he added. Despite his remarkable predictions, Nicolas’ insists he is “not special” – instead believing that all of us possess the same abilities, but that scepticism prevents us from trusting them.

Sydneyaposs harbourfront was cloaked in smoke as tens of thousands of revellers gathered to watch a -minute fireworks show that went ahead despite calls for it to be scrapped. More than , people had signed an online petition urging the city to cancel the display out of respect and donate the money to the firefighting effort. Click here to follow our live blog for the latest videos, photos and updates from New Yearaposs Eve celebrations around the world. High fire danger and extreme temperatures - western Sydney hit C on Tuesday - had led to the cancellation of several planned New Yearaposs fireworks displays, including in the national capital Canberra. But Sydney pressed ahead with its plans and was granted a fire ban exemption, while other cities had their applications rejected. Earlier on Tuesday, Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore defended the decision and delivered a scathing attack on the national government’s climate change record.  Scientists have said climate change is fuelling a longer and more intense bushfire season this summer. The mayor told reporters that much of the New Yearaposs event’s budget had already been spent and the celebration generates almost £million for the New South Wales economy. Signs set up around the harbour told people how to donate money to help those affected by fires. Bushfires are raging amid a drought and summer heatwave that has sent temperatures soaring above C in all of Australiaaposs states.The crisis worsened on Tuesday as two more people died, five others were missing and feared dead, and thousands were forced to flee to beaches in a wall of smoke under a blood-red sky to escape. Police said a father and son died in the early hours of Tuesday defending their home in Cobargo, near the coast in the state of New South Wales ,  miles south of Sydney. The town was hit by one out-of-control fire which roared into the community in the middle of the night, with its main street bearing the impact.  Further south, fires continued to blaze out of control in the state of Victoria, where some , people were forced to take shelter on the beach in the holiday town of Mallacoota, in the East Gippsland district along the Pacic coast. Around , more people were sheltering in community centres in the town. Those sheltering on the beach were advised to go into the waterthe fire situation worsened.Similar advice was given to people in several NSW coastal towns, where fearful residents and holidaymakers had also abandoned their dwellings to move onto beaches. People in Mallacoota posted on social media about hearing the roar of the fire, circulating photos showing how, in the words of some, the smoke had turned the day into night. As defence force personnel assisted firefighters and volunteers in tackling some of the worst blazes, eight fires were burning at emergency level across NSW, with a similar number ongoing in Victoria, and two more in the island state of Tasmania.

In the second half, I thought we were excellent.“Graham Dorrans and Fin Robertson controlled everything that happened in the game.“Disappointment is the over-riding emotion probably but I might look back over it and say: ‘You know what, a point after going behind so early is good.’“But there is just real disappointment over how superior we were in the second half but we have not got the win.”After Nicky Clark had put United in front after just five minutes, the away side came back into the contest after the break with Dorrans smashing in a low volley shortly after the restart to open his scoring account for the club.James added: “It was a lovely goal.“He has getting himself into positions where keepers are pulling off world-class saves.“He is getting close to full fitness.

That is why we are delighted to have him.”The Dens gaffer is also delighted to have Dorrans around to help with the development of -year-old Robertson after the youngster put in an accomplished display in his first-ever Dundee derby.“It has been a bit of a learning experience for Fin to have both Graham and Paul McGowan in the same midfield as him,” added James.“Looking back, I probably shouldn’t have left him out of the previous derby at Tannadice.“I’ve been advised not to say it because maybe you are doubting yourself but, looking back, I shouldn’t have done it because he has proved how consistent he can be.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget. The Grace Award for Caring was named not only because it takes grace to care for someone, but because it takes grace to accept care from someone.To nominate a carer visit www.revitalise.org.uk graceawards or call  .Abby Kessock-Philip, Revitalise.Sir,From October to December, deer are more likely to be on the road as they move down to lower ground to find food and shelter.The majority of collisions take place in early evening through to midnight, with another peak from am to am.Particularly in these peak times, we advise motorists to slow down and watch for deer crossing roads.Deer can suddenly appear before you have time to brake. If you do hit a deer, report it to the police, evenyou are uninjured and your car is not damaged, as the deer may be fatally injured and suffering.Jamie Hammond, SNH management officer."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmory claim development trophy","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis year’s U shinty development trophy took place at Mossfield Stadium, Oban, on Sunday November .It was guaranteed there would be a new name on the trophy this year as Kilmory and Ardnamurchan competed in this competition to see who would take home the silverware.Alec MacVicar was the man in charge of proceedings and got the game underway at pm.Within five minutes, Euan Gilmour had netted for the Mid Argyll side and at that point it looked as though Kilmory may have the firepower to take the game away from the Ardnamurchan team.Ardnamurchan then started to find a foothold in the game and were awarded a penalty for a late swing in the box. Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes. Half-time came giving a much-needed break to the players and spectators.Eilidh Cameron obliged with her customary goal a minute into the second half, however, Ardnamurchan replied  minutes later.The game was in the balance but Eilidh Cameron got the decisive goal on  minutes.The play continued to flow from end to end and at full time both teams had good reason to hold their heads high after providing such entertaining shinty for the crowd.Euan McMurdo, Shinty Regional Development officer, said: #Credit has to go to the players and coaches for providing such an entertaining match at a time of year when most people want to stay warm indoors.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

There has been too much focus on polarisation and not enough time delivering for the electorate. It is the season of goodwill. Our politicians need to take time out from politicking and bickering, get on with the day job, and deliver for the greater good across all parliaments in these challenging times.#I truly believe we have more that brings us together than ides us and NFUS is a template to follow.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird. We look forward to supporting the project to make sure that Golden Eagles flourish in the south of Scotland.Project partners include RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land  Estates, Scottish Forestry, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Southern Uplands Partnership.Funded by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, project partners, Scottish Power Renewables, the Scottish Government and local LEADER Programmes, the initiative is a key project under the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Challenge for Scottish Bioersity."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-sevens-bosses-make-u-turn-road-closure","story":"BOSSES at Melrose Rugby have made a U-turn on their plans to close off St Marys Road during next years sevens.As previously reported, the stretch was due to be shut for two weeks ndash to allow for a temporary stand to be erected.But following discussions with the towns community council, chiefs running the four-day tournament have changed their minds.Now St Marys road will only be partially closed on game days, with a traffic light system in place.Philip Morris, sevens tournament director at Melrose Rugby, said: ldquoAn event like this one will of course come with an element of disruption to the usual routine.\"The Melrose community has embraced the sevens every year, however, concerns around an expanded event are of course completely understandable.\"For the avoidance of doubt, wersquore working really hard to support local businesses as suppliers to the event.\"And wersquoll also be consulting with local residents to address any specic concerns they have too.\"We are confident the economic boost to Melrose and the surrounding Borders towns during the expanded sevens event will be huge.\"News of the U-turn has been welcomed by members of Melrose Community Council.Chairman William Windram said: \"I still think the plans are a bit fluid at the moment, and I think there is still a lot of work going on behind the scenes.\"There are, however, still some issues like late night noise that have not been considered yet, but we have asked them [the club] to come back to our meeting in February to give us an update.\"Some amelioration has certainly taken place and we should be pleased.\"One of the concerns raised by Melrose Community Council at its November meeting was the impact the tournament would have on churchgoers ndash with the event taking place over the Easter weekend.In response, Mr Morris said: \"We are working hard to ensure the important Easter Sunday church service is not impacted and people will be able to get to and from the church without signicant disruption.\"Now the traffic situation on St Marys Road is becoming clearer, we have a plan that we feel will satisfy our local residents.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of organisations involved in business transport in Haddington and confirmed invitees include Haddington Business Community Partnership, Haddington Community Development Trust, East Coast Buses, Prentice

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

The Kidney Flowers - Small FingersThis is a stomping, trashy, punky, rfing cracker that has been rehashed from an old self-released EP and sounds like a mighty collision of the Pixies, The Fall, The Walkmen and the Wedding Present in one blistering cut from the stunning debut album from the three-piece Glasgow musically primitive fast food enthusiasts who just might be my new favourite garage combo. Watch out Idles. Lewis Capaldi - Someone You LovedWhoever broke the Bathgate crooners Heart has made him millions. A number one single across the world from that the guy next door whose music has no bearing on his crazy social media appearances. Blanck Mass - House vs HouseA scream and a percussive rapid-fire vocal sample ushers in this eight-minute house-tinged synth epic and first single from the cracking fourth album of Benjamin John Power, who is also half of electro noise duo F*ck Buttons. The Edinburgh-based electro fiend topped this list last year with Odd Scene.TNGHT - SerpentHot Glasgow producer Hudson Mohawkes and Canadian producer Lunice make a welcome comeback after helping to usher in trap seven years ago, to produce this bone-shudderingly spiralling pulp of warped bass and percussion topped off with what sounds like an native American war cry.

The song is the first taste of his forthcoming debut album.

The newcomer managed to sell out the legendary King Tuts Wah Wah Hut without having released any music at all online, a feat previously accomplished by Lewis Capaldi. Steve Mason - RocketThe best compliment you could pay this soaring standout about love, depression, disappointment and ultimately hope from the fourth solo album by the former front man of The Beta Band is it is the kind of dramatic epic that would not sound out of place on his previous bands acclaimed Three EPs.

Hideo Kojima, the game creator, said: \"You can cry just by listening to this song.\" Its not just hype. Anna Meredith - Inhale ExhaleLondon-born and Edinburgh-bred composer, performer and producer gave her twist on Vivaldis Four Seasons last year, only to show this year she can create a wonderfully hypnotic synth-pop song and sing on what is an instant highlight from her mercurial FIBS album.The song is underpinned with lyrics exploring a more sinister and pessimistic take on what lsquolivingrsquo or having a lsquowild timersquo might be like for \"a cautious person like myself\".She sings:\"You say yoursquore dancing in the deep end, but to me it looks like drowning\". C Duncan - Talk Talk TalkThe sublime opening track from the third album from the Glasgow musician and the first away from his bedroom studio, also moved him away from his introspective art pop on this, into synth pop gem territory. But typical of the Scot who received a Mercury Prize nomination for his debut album Architect, it remains sounding like nothing  around, with signature layered harmonies and a gorgeous hooksome middle eight.ldquoTalk Talk Talk is about miscommunication. Itrsquos about not realising that yoursquore actually on the same page as someone and how a misperception can drive you apart. However, itrsquos also about realising this and rebuilding bridges,\" he says. Wuh Oh - Pretty Boy Glasgow-producer Wuh Oh, aka Peter Ferguson teams up with Hudson Mohawke for a mindblowingly original classical meets post-electro music with cellos and xylophones thrown in for good measure.\"One day something in my brain exploded and it was asI could suddenly see what made the chord progressions and melodies work. I got mega obsessed with harmony and since then Irsquove never stopped searching for magic note combinations I donrsquot understand yet: those greeny-purple chords,\" Ferguson says. Goodnight Louisa - Hollow GodldquoBettys got her head in the oven again.\" So starts this spinetingling, highly charged, emotionally dark but hopeful cinematic-pop debut single from Louise McCraw who fronted the underrated Edinburgh band Skjoslashr.It is dedicated to a little boy in the accompanying video, her uncle, Michael. He died ten years after the footage was shot as the result of a tragic car accident. \"I drew a lot of inspiration from Michael to write this song, that no matter when we think weve lost someone, they still live within us, in the curve of an eye, through theof a nose, through our mannerisms, we will carry them forever,\" she says.Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  This is the Spoty playlist.This is the YouTube playlist."},{"url":null,"title":"people-decade-20-movers-shakers-history-makers","story":"In , Time Magazine named its person of the year as \"the silence breakers\". McGowan was just one of those many women who stepped forward to make accusations about Harvey Weinstein that year. She was there at the beginning of a series or revelations about the producer which would snowball into a global sharing of stories of womens experience of sexual assault and harassment that would be called #MeToo.If anyone became a figurehead, it was McGowan. She may not have come up with the term Me Too ndash that was Tarana Burke back in . Nor was she the person to put the hashtag out into the ocean of social media ndash that was Alyssa Milano, her co-star from Charmed. But she made her mark as someone who would not be silenced. She has also claimed that she was the first person to out Weinstein.#MeToo was a cultural revolution and catharsis. Back in , when it broke, it felt asHollywood and the many fields where men were protected by their power and influence would never be the same again. In this revolution around what women should tolerate, who would be listened to, and what should be shamed, McGowan stood out. She wrote a memoir, Brave. She used her anger as a weapon. In an interview with the Times, she asked, \"Who has been more effective  hellip Playing nice for women hasnt got us very far.\"Weinstein recently complained that he was \"a forgotten man\". With his trial coming up next month ndash five charges, including two counts of rape ndash he might wish he were more forgotten than he is. #MeToo might have experienced backlash and criticism. But out of it did come much that was positive and inspirational, particularly the courage of the women who came forward. McGowan embodies that. Her voice carried the message that the time when abusers could expect silence was over.VICKY ALLANPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE, ACTOR, WRITER AND PRODUCERSpeaking to The Herald recently, Scottish actress Ellie Haddington recalled her time working on The Cafe, a Sky One sitcom which aired in . It starred The Royle Familys Ralf Little alongside Haddington and Littles co-writer Michelle Terry. But it was another cast member, then an unknown -year-old actress, who particularly caught Haddingtons eye. \"I can remember looking at her,\" she said, \"and thinking: My God, what an extraordinary inidual.\" The inidual in question was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her first major role.Fast forward eight years and the London-born polymath has the world at her feet, particularly the part that houses the gilded constituencies that hand out Emmys and Golden Globes. The  Golden Globe ceremony is on January  in Beverly Hills and Waller-Bridge is up for two awards. Ten days later shell be honoured at the Screen Actors Guild Awards where shes nominated in two categories. Andshe flies home laden with mantelpiece accessories it wont be the first time ndash she scooped three Golden Globes at last years award as well as three Primetime Emmys.If not, well theres the not insignicant matter of the th James Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in April. Waller-Bridge co-wrote the script and great things are expected. Of coursetheres one production on which Waller-Bridges name is indelibly stamped its Fleabag, written by and starring her as a young Londoner navigating family, work, sex and relationships with brutal honesty and unsettling humour.Starting out as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Fringe, it was turned into a TV series in  but was dropped quietly onto BBC Three, then only available online. But word-of-mouth is still a powerful tool even in our digital age and by the summer it had been relaunched on BBC Four. The rest is television history: when we look back at this decades television, well be splitting it into pre and post-Fleabag.Even more interestingly, Waller-Bridge followed that triumph with one of the career curve-balls weve now come to expect: an adaptation of Luke Jenningss Villanelle spy novel series. Retitled Killing Eve it was fresh, funny, thrillingly violent and gratuitously fashion-forward, and made a star of lead actress Jodie Comer, whose pink Molly Godard tulle dress became the go-to Halloween costume for hipsters everywhere. And, of course, it hauled in yet more gongs for its writer.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesWill it be third time lucky with No Time to Die  Dont ever bet against Phoebe Waller-Bridge.BARRY DIDCOCKANDY MURRAY, TENNIS PLAYERSmall, wet, overweight countries should not ndash and usually do not ndash produce tennis superstars. As only those from other small countries can appreciate ndash the Jamaicans and Swiss, perhaps ndash possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller.Thats exactly what Andy Murray has done for Scotland . Is there any feeling comparable to the buzz of watching Murray play a big match, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body  I think not.And yet the Dunblane-born champion is not only from Scotland, but very much of his homeland. During the late Noughties, the young, gangly, wild-haired Murray thrilled us with his impressive Wimbledon runs. But as the years went on and he just missed out on a slew of grand slam trophies, many English media outlets and tennis fans took against him, decrying the sweary intensity and dry Scottish banter. This only made Scots love him more, of course.Eventually, with patience, maturity, courage and sheer hard graft came the top honours in tennis ndash the US Open, two Wimbledon singles titles, two Olympic gold medals, the Davis Cup, the coveted world number one spot ndash and global adulation.But as much as he grew as a sportsman, whats equally remarkable about Murray is how he grew as person. Indeed, it is his openness, humanity and humility, the way he speaks out against sexism in tennis, that make him a true hero, loved by his peers and the public, rather than simply respected.A devastating hip injury ndash and subsequent resurfacing operation ndash nearly ended Murrays career, and his recent comeback has been both painful and inspiring to watch.Murray taught Scots to dream big. But the father of three also taught Scots men, in particular, showing your feelings, being true to yourself, makes you a bigger man in every way.MARIANNE TAYLORJEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEOThe worlds richest man is fond of reminding people that he started Amazon in his garage. A company that is now worth more than pound trillion and employs in the region of , people began with Bezos packing books and taking them to the post office himself.Like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and Twitters Jack Dorsey, Bezos grasped early on the potential of the internet. That realisation has had huge consequences. Amazon has transformed shopping, helped hollow out the high street, and led to a fortune for its creator estimated at poundbn.That has allowed him to set up his own space exploration company and buy the Washington Post .Bezoss success cant be gainsayed, but at what cost  Employees have bitterly complained about working conditions, the EU is investigating the company for anti-trust violations and earlier this year it had to scrap plans to build a second headquarters in New York when local politicians questioned why a company making bna month should receive taxpayers cash to move to the city.Oh yes, and it was also revealed that the company had not paid any income tax in the US the previous year. Or the year before that. You dont get to be the richest man in the world by giving anything away, obviously.TEDDY JAMIESONDAVID BOWIE, MUSICIANIn the months after his death at the start of , as Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, there was a spate of tweets wonderingBowies absence was now one of the reasons why everything was going to hell in a handcart.\"Im not saying that David Bowie was holding the fabric of the universe together, but *gestures broadly at everything*\" tweeted blogger Katie Liewy with tongue firmly in cheek in June that year.Whether his influence actually stretched that far, theres no doubt that culturally this decade was Bowies, in the same way as the s belonged to the Beatles. As Oasis looked to Lennon and McCartney in the mid-s, Bowie became the touchstone for any musician ndash from FKA Twigs to St Vincent ndash in the s who wanted to push the odd boundary.But none of them did it as well as the original, who ed at the start of , after almost a decade in which he had withdrawn from public view. He released a new single, Where Are We Now , on his birthday without any warning. It presaged a new album, The Next Day, and a VA retrospective, David Bowie Is. Three years later he released an album, Blackstar, on his th birthday. Two days later his death was announced. It was ashe was curating his own end.:From the death of Bowie to the rise of grime: The decade in pop musicFor anyone who knew him in the middle of the s the fact that Bowie avoided being a rock n roll casualty must have seemed a miracle given his copious drug intake back then.Instead, he weaned himself off them, created some of the most memorable and potent music of the late th century, reinvented himself as a mainstream pop star in the s, then became an elder statesman who embraced everything from drum n bass to the internet before his final st-century flourish.His is one of the great stories in pop and in  it came to a tragic yet magnicent conclusion.TEDDY JAMIESONELON MUSK, TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURThe chronicles of self-styled maverick billionaire Elon Musk never fail to fascinate. Among his outlandish adventures and madcap musings, we have Elon and the space car Elon and the Thai cave rescue Elon and the dead gorilla novelty rap Elon and his plan to nuke Mars.South African-born Musk first pricked the public consciousness as a technology entrepreneur, investor and engineer in  when, aged , he sold his web software company, Zip, to Compaq for  million .He continued to ascend his field throughout the Noughties, but it is in the last decade that Musk has become a household name for his roles as founder chief engineer designer of SpaceX and the CEO product architect at Tesla.Granted, this is often more down to calamity than plaudits for his innovative work. Such as the cringe-inducing moment during a recent unveiling for the new Tesla Cybertruck when, demonstrating how tough the \"armour glass\" of the windows was to break, they were duly smashed.Or when he referred to British er Vernon Unsworth ndash who helped rescue  Thai boys trapped in a flooded underwater cave in  ndash as \"pedo guy\" on Twitter .Then theres Musks lofty plans to \"nuke Mars\" ndash which he describes as \"a fixer upper of a planet\" ndash suggesting that nuclear bombs should be detonated at its poles to melt the ice caps and allow it to sufficiently heat up for humans to dwell there.And the head-scratching moment when he dropped a track on SoundCloud called RIP Harambe, a heavily auto-tuned song about the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla whose death in  sparked a global outpouring of grief and anger.Sure, Musk sometimes loses credibility due to his more leftfield thinking ndash such as a belief that were all probably living in a giant computer simulation like The Matrix or a Sims-style game controlled by superior beings ndash but there is no denying that hes a clever guy who shouldnt be underestimated.If this is a simulation, we cant wait to see what our overlords get him to do next.SUSAN SWARBRICKMEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEXSurely it wasnt meant to be like this. If you become a fairy tale princess can you not then expect to live happily ever after That hasnt been the case for Meghan Markle. Yes, she had the royal wedding last year attended by the great and the good and the merely famous. Yes, she got a title, a handsome prince and a royal baby . Not what she must have expected growing up a mixed-race kid in Los Angeles.And yet since the wedding there has found herself a constant target of the tabloid press. She recently filed a lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter to her estranged father. It also prompted her husband Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to condemn the medias \"relentless propaganda\" which was, he said, often \"knowingly  and malicious\" in a public statement announcing the legal action.His anger is perhaps understandable given the paparazzis involvement in the death of his mother. \"Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\" he admitted this year.The Duchess of Sussexs major crime would appear to be that she has \"opinions\". There is a class of media commentator ndash mouthy, reactionary and perhaps most importantly white ndash who is offended by her feminism and likes to moan about the couples \"wokeness\". It has prompted \"the Queen\", or, rather, the TV version of the monarch, Olivia Colman, star of The Crown, to speak out against the critics.:From Leonard Bernsteinrsquos MASS to the GRIT Orchestra, Keith Bruces musical picks of the decade\"I dont know why theyre so mean to a fellow human being,\" Coleman said of the press coverage.Or maybe we simply have to accept there is no such thing as happy ever after.TEDDY JAMIESONGRETA THUNBERG, ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER\"My name is Greta,\" a Swedish schoolgirl wrote on her flyers in . \"I am in ninth grade, and I am school-striking for the climate. Since you adults dont give a damn about my future, I wont either.\"Its hard to believe that it has only been just over a year since Thunberg ndash recognised now simply as \"Greta\" to millions ndash made her viral UN speech in Poland, saying, \"You say you love your children above all . And yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\"Thunberg may only have made her stamp in the final year of the decade, but at just  years old she has done more to provoke an attitude sht on environment than anyone, and she began it by skipping school.Her words and actions have woken millions of schoolchildren, four million of whom went on strike from school on September , as well as adults, to the science-backed threat of the climate emergency. On what is arguably the biggest issue of our time, hers is the voice that has led, upbraiding those in leadership. Margaret Atwood called her the Joan of Arc of environmentalism. Donald Trump told her to \"chill\". Collins Dictionary made \"climate strike\" its word of the year.Why did people listen to her, when others saying the same were ignored  Perhaps because of who she was ndash not an adult, scientist, politician or expert ndash and how she, a teenager with Aspergers Syndrome, delivered her message, politely, yet angrily and without softenings.To the UN General Assembly, in September, she said: \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.

Can we alter the ending of this terrying nightmare  Thunberg dares us to.VICKY ALLANNICOLA STURGEON, FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLANDBy the time Nicola Sturgeon became Scotlands first female First Minister in , at the age of , she had already been involved in politics for more than a quarter of a century.She joined the SNP in her native Ayrshire ndash then a Labour bastion ndash aged  at the height of the Thatcher years. It was the decisive first step on a journey that would transform not only the young Sturgeon but the fortunes of her party, and, ultimately, the political landscape in Scotland.After becoming an MSP in , Sturgeon, a solicitor by trade, impressed from the outset, serving in two shadow cabinets. In , she was elected deputy party leader to Alex Salmond during his second stint as party leader. The partnership was successful and in  the SNP won a majority at Holyrood, paving the way for s independence referendum.When Salmond resigned as SNP leader and First Minister in the aftermath of the Yes campaigns loss, Sturgeon was the obvious choice to replace him.:From Frozen to  Years a Slave, the best films of the last  yearsThe five years since have seen tumultuous change in UK politics, with Sturgeon growing in stature as politician and stateswoman, both in UK and European terms, even in the eyes of many who do not share her stance on independence. She regularly appears in glossy magazine lists of the worlds most influential women.During the recent General Election campaign her clear opposition to Brexit and impressive performances in TV debates ndash not to mention her lively Twitter feed ndash won her a whole new legion of fans in England, particularly among women. Will Sturgeon lead Scotland to independence in the s  That remains to be seen. Regardless, her place in Scottish history, as politician and role model, is guaranteed.MARIANNE TAYLORBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESThings might look dferent now. In , at the end of Barack Obamas second term in office, when commentators looked back at his legacy as president, there was a sense that his achievements were, at best, mixed.True, he had withdrawn US soldiers from Iraq, improved relations with Cuba, reached a nuclear deal with Iran and introduced Obamacare.Set against that, though, he escalated American military involvement in Afghanistan, increased drone strikes in Pakistan, saw wealth and income inequality rocket under his watch. Guantanamo Bay was still in operation when he left office and though he spoke out in favour of gun control he didnt manage to introduce it.Obama could point to Republican obstruction in the House of Congress. Even so there was a whf of missed opportunities about his presidency. Perhaps that was inevitable. In the end a centrist president was never going to live up to the utopian notions so many Americans projected on to him during the  election campaign.And yet, in retrospect, perhaps his achievements are growing. What has been missed over the last four years is his articulacy, eloquence, wit and normality.In part its because he represents the antithesis of what came after. An inarticulate, narcissistic, racist, corrupt old man whose first term has been a skip fire of the vanities ending in a vote for impeachment. Obama for all his failings always felt like he was an adult in the room. Can you say the same of Donald Trump TEDDY JAMIESONKIM KARDASHIAN WEST, REALITY TV STAR AND ENTREPRENEURLove her or loathe her, there is no denying that Kim Kardashian West ripped up the rule book in her rise to becoming a world-famous reality star with a multi-million-dollar business empire and a global fanbase.Having first found peripheral fame as a friend and stylist to heiress Paris Hilton in the early s, Kardashian West gained notoriety after the release of her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray J in . That same year, the familys reality TV series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, began airing.While the naysayers reckoned it would be a fleeting  minutes of fame, Kardashian West pulled off a shrewd and unparalleled move: she utilised social media to make herself into a brand. Today, her Midas touch extends across fashion, fragrances and cosmetics to television, books, gaming, and even law and politics. Oh, and she is queen of the selfie.An exaggerated hourglass figure and cartoonishly large backside have become a trademark for Kardashian West, garnering as many ndash and often more ndash column inches as her entrepreneurial ventures.: The best visual arts of the last  years, by Jan Patience and Sarah Urwin JonesIndeed, when Kardashian West posed for a  cover of Paper magazine with her rear bared and oiled up like a Greek wrestler, it saw a new phrase \"break the internet\" coined, referring to the frenzy that the images sparked.That same year, she joined her husband, the rapper Kanye West, for a landmark cover on Vogue magazine. \"There are a lot of firsts,\" Kardashian West said at the time. \"Kanyes the first rapper to be on, Im the first reality person to be on, were the first interracial couple.\"She continues to surprise people. Earlier this year, Kardashian West announced she was following in her late fathers footsteps by studying to become a lawyer .Kardashian West ndash who boasts  million social media followers on Instagram alone ndash seems determined to use her  and stratospheric public profilefor good, visiting US president Donald Trump at the Oval Office last year to discuss justice reform.She successfully lobbied Trump to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, a -year-old woman who spent  years in an Alabama prison, without parole, for a non-violent, first-time drug offence. Johnson was released in  and Kardashian West has vowed to tackle other miscarriage of justices.Her work to date makes for impressive reading. But in the scheme of things, one could argue that Kardashian West is only just getting started. With her husband having announced he intends to run for US president in , a decade from now this might all seem like small fry.SUSAN SWARBRICKSTORMZY, RAPPERWhy is Stormzy one of the most influential public figures of the last decade  There are  people you could ask ndash  black students who were admitted to Cambridge University in . Thats up about  per cent more than the  who started courses in .Not all of it is down to Stormzy, but a lot of it may be. In , the grime artist announced he would be paying the tuition fees and maintenance grants of two black Cambridge students, and this year he said hed be paying for two more. Its called the Stormzy Scholarship and now theyre calling the rise in the number of black students at Cambridge the Stormzy Effect.The question is: can the effect spread  Theres still a huge gap between the chances of going to university in the UKyoure white and well-off and the chances of goingyoure black or youre poor or youre both and some argue universities will have to offer places to poorer students with lower grades to start making a dference. But the good news, thanks to Stormzy, is that black students now make up more than three per cent of new undergrads at Cambridge for the first time.Stormzy has had another effect too, and perhaps its one that will be even more profound. Rappers have traditionally had a bit of an image problem: theyve usually promoted out-of-school activities rather than in-school ones. But Stormzys dferent. \"It sounds corny coming from a rapper,\" he says, \"but I did love learning and I loved studying.\" The Stormzy Effect could inspire many others to feel the same.MARK SMITHSIMONE BILES, GYMNASTOnce in a letime ndashyoure very lucky ndash theres a sporting star who shines so brightly that they eclipse everything that has come before.Step forward Simone Biles. The US gymnasts talent and achievements are such that we humble observers have long since exhausted the superlatives.While the gymternet ndash as the online community of gymnastics fans are known ndash has been abuzz about Biles for years, it was at the Rio  Olympic Games that the rest of the world sat up and took notice.: From Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour to What Girls Are Made of, five standout theatre shows of the decadeBiles, who won four golds and a bronze, found herself repeatedly compared to a raft of male sporting greats asthat is the only way we could comprehend her colossal achievements. \"Im not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps,\" she responded. \"Im the first Simone Biles.\"The -year-old from Texas burst onto the global gymnastics scene in , winning her debut world all-around gold in Antwerp. It is a title that Biles has claimed on four further occasions , alongside a raft of inidual apparatus medals.In October, Biles took her th medal, making her the most decorated gymnast ndash male or female ndash in world championship history .But it is not only in a competition arena that Biles proved herself a gargantuan presence. In January , she released a statement on Twitter confirming that former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her under the guise of medical treatment.Nassar was later sentenced to up to  years in prison after more than  women stood up in court and laid bare their own experiences of sexual abuse in a scandal spanning three decades.Biles and her fellow survivors were awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. At the  US National Championships, she designed and wore a teal leotard ndash a colour used to raise awareness about sexual abuse.A vocal critic of the US Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for their response to the allegations against Nassar, Biles continues to lobby for better accountability from both governing bodies.She refuses to be defined by what happened. Biless willingness to push the boundaries of her sport remains unabated. At the  US Gymnastics Championships, she stepped out in a crystal-studded leotard bearing her surname above an embroidered image of a goats head.It was a nod to the acronym GOAT, which is shorthand for the Greatest of All Time. Far from being boastful, however, this was Biless tongue-in-cheek \"jab back\" at the \"haters\" .She has the goods to back it up. This year Biles had two gymnastics skills ndash a hugely dficult triple twisting-double somersault in her floor routine and double-double dismount from beam ndash named in her honour after she became the first woman to perform them. Both appear to defy gravity.The Tokyo  Olympic Games loom on the horizon. Simone Biles is far from done yet.SUSAN SWARBRICKABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADIHe was the most wanted terrorist in the world. For more than half of the last decade, no single figure caused more chaos in the Middle East than Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri. For that was his real name, even though the world came to know him by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.As the decade began al-Baghdadi had already served four years in the sprawling US military detention centre called Camp Bucca, which had detained some of the Iraq Wars most radical jihadists. In political and religious terms he was already a long way from his days as a PhD student of Islamic Studies at university in Baghdad.By , clad in black robes and standing in the pulpit of a mosque in Iraqs second city of Mosul, he was already claiming the title caliph of the Muslim world and leadership of the infamous Islamic Stategroup.Few even then could have imagined the chaos, carnage and suffering that al -Baghdadi, born one of six children in , would wreak on the world.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesIt would not be until October , , in a raid carried out by US Special Forces, when al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest in the Syrian province of Idlib, that the world was rid of his malign presence.\"We killed the last murderous bastard who ran IS, lets go get the next one,\" proclaimed one tough-talking US Republican Senator in the wake of al- Baghdadis death.But in the tunnels and booby traps left behind in cities like Mosul and Raqqa to the mass graves and thousands of faceless, black-clad female followers haunting refugee camps, ISs presence remains palpable along with its new new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.Many IS fighters now languish in prisons, but thousands more remain at large re-grouping and organising while their franchises likewise operate across the globe. This is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadis lingering and still menacing legacy.DAVID PRATT, CONTRIBUTING FOREIGN EDITORBOB SERVANT, BURGER TYCOONAh, Bob Servant. How do we love thee  Let us count the ways.

Public opinion has become ever more supportive. LGBT people have become ever more visible. And in , gay marriage was made legal in most of the UK.Then theres the T in LGBT. A few days ago, the Scottish Government published a draft bill which will simply the process of trans men and women having their gender legally recognised, but its not been an easy path. Some feminists say the legislation will undermine the rights of women. Trans activists say a change in the law is the only way to end the demeaning legal and medical process trans people currently have to endure. The two sides have not always been nice to each other.What the debate, and the bitterness, may prove is there is still some distance to go to LGBT equality, but the fact we got closer in the last decade is in large part due to its trans pioneers and one pioneer in particular. You know what Im talking about andnot, you should: the cover of Vanity Fair in June . Caitlyn Jenner. Former Olympic athlete. Openly transgender woman.For Jenner, the photograph was an act of happiness. \"Im so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self,\" she said when the magazine was published. \"Welcome to the world Caitlyn.\" And for those who saw the picture, it was an act of courage and activism. When is equality  When trans people are in parliaments, and in churches, and in governments, and on the cover of fashion magazines.MARK SMITHDONALD TRUMP, BORIS JOHNSON, NIGEL FARAGE AND VLADIMIR PUTIN, POPULIST POLITICIANSVladimir Putin is about to mark  years in power ndash he first became Russian president on December ,  ndash and for much of that time the West has looked at his style ndash authoritarian, bombastic and a little bit silly ndash and thought: thank God were not like that.But that was then. First, a man with a fag in his mouth ndash call me Nigel ndash became leader of Ukip and the Brexit Party. Then a man with a phone in his hand ndash call me Donald ndash became president of the United States. And then a man with an inappropriate phrase on the tip of his tongue ndash call me Boris ndash became Prime Minister of the UK.Its not a coincidence they are known by their Christian names. Nigel, Donald and Boris represent a new, first-names-only style of politics that has dominated America and the UK in the last  years: populist, chummy, big on rhetoric, light on detail, and ndash much to the frustration of liberals ndash effective at attracting votes. Those three men have attracted support from working class voters who have traditionally looked to the left for answers. In the last  years, though, theyve looked right, and the result is Nigel, Donald and Boris.The next decade will decide their fate. Arguably, Farage has already been neutered after the Brexit Partys dismal election campaign. But the fates of Trump and Johnson are less certain. Trump has been impeached and will face a trial in the Senate, but its controlled by the Republicans, who arent going to vote their man out. As for Johnson, hes just won a big, blue majority and, failing a cock-uphes going to be here for the next five years.Beware:  years of populism may become .MARK SMITHPROFESSOR PETER HIGGS, SCIENTISTScience always plays the long game. It took almost a century for scientists in  to prove Einsteins  predictions of gravitational waves in space, which formed part of his theory of general relativity. Professor Peter Higgs didnt have to wait quite that long.Back in , while teaching at Edinburgh University, Higgs published papers predicting the existence of a particle that gave mass to the most basic building blocks of matter. It soon became known as the Higgs Boson. Much to his dismay, it was also called the God particle.No-one could find it, however. Or not until , when the large hadron collider near Geneva finally proved its existence.A year later Higgs, then , won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the prize with fellow scientist Francois Englert.Higgs decided to go on holiday when the prize was announced, neglecting to take his mobile phone with him in a bid to avoid being pestered by journalists.

Im determined to kick the social media habit in the New Year. Not an easy task since I have to push my columns across social media as part of my work. I have , followers as well. Ive no idea who most of them are, or what they think, because theyre generally not the people who reply to my posts.The responses I get are often abusive taunts from angry Scottish nationalists claiming that Im paid by the ldquoYoon Herald to do down Scotland and the SNP. Many of the rest are from the sneery, jeery activist class of keyboard warriors who spend their time trawling Twitter for something to be offended by.Time was when you could have interesting discussions about politics, economics, art, films. But as politics has become polarised it is increasingly dficult to contain any discussion. It rapidly gets hijacked by agenda-driven interlopers who want to reduce everything to an ideological row. And yes, maybe Ive been guilty of that too.The fun has also drained out of Twitter as literalism has overwhelmed it. Jokes are now impossible unless they are in the style of: ldquoBoris Johnson is a cnut. RTyou agree. On social media you cant afford ambiguity, or irony. The title of this column, for example, would be taken to mean that I am a card-carrying supporter of Boris Johnson.On Twitter everything is black or white and there must under no circumstances be a hint of grey. Yet for all the virtue signalling and self-righteous moralising, the chief characteristic of Twitter remains toxic abuse. Women, Jews, ldquoTerfs and many besides find they are under constant attack from anonymous trolls.SoI find Twitter so problematic, why do I keep going back to it, like a dog to its own sick  Well, it is an invaluable news wire, for one. On general election night, for example, it allows you to be live at every count in Scotland.Twitter is nearly always first with the news, eventhe news is wrong. The BBCs political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, attracted a torrent of abuse during the election campaign when she tweeted that a Tory special adviser had been ldquopunched by Labour protesters outside Leeds General Infirmary. He hadnt. She corrected it immediately, but it has since gone down as proof positive of ldquoTory bias at the BBC .It is very easy to spread fake news on Twitter. During the election campaign, I retweeted a post which I thought had come from the BBC announcing that Ms Kuenssberg was going to interview Boris Johnson instead of Andrew Neil. Disgrace, I said. The BBC had caved in to the PM and given him a softer interviewer. I was mortied when I realised it was a fake.The BBC is now considering banning political journalists from Twitter because of the blowback. Its getting out of hand. Anyone connected with the hated ldquoMSM, short for mainstream media, is accused of compulsive lying, intellectual dishonesty, or pandering to the right.During the general election Labour and Remain activists more or less colonised Twitter, and turned the place into an inquisition. Anyone failing to agree that Boris Johnson is a lying crypto-fascist, financed by dark money, who beats his we was liable to be condemned by ldquopile on. That is the social media term for hyperbolic rubbishing by legions of hostile posts.On social media, the strength of an argument is irrelevant, all that matters is how often something is repeated. Confirmation bias is the bane of social media. Twitters legion of legal experts were certain that Boris Johnson could never get the EU Withdrawal Deal reopened last year ndash until he did.Most of us are now aware of ldquofilter bubbles ndash how social media curates your ldquofeed so that as time goes on you see only people with the same prejudices you have. Ive tried correcting this algorithmic brain washing, but without success. No matter how much I mute and unfollow I still see the same people making the same empty-headed condemnations of their political opponents. The same lame memes. The same dodgy statistics.As a result, Twitter has, for me, become a kind of anti-filter bubble. Instead of confirming me in my political beliefs, the constant exposure to hyper-partisan reflections of them has started to work in reverse. It is a kind of aversion therapy. A Remain-supporting lefty Yesser, I now bristle when I see Tory Brexiteers and Unionists being portrayed as racists and idiots.Before Christmas, the Conservative columnist Alex Massie unwisely tweeted that refusing to have friends who have dferent opinions to your own is as sign of small-mindedness. This provoked a tiny-minded torrent of jeering replies from people saying they couldnt possibly be friends with ldquoTory racists.Said one: ldquoIm not hanging around with people who would see me suffer at the hands of actual eugenicists in the Tory Party.\" Said another: ldquoI dont want friends that want children to starve to death so the rich can get richer.\"These people actually believe this. ldquoTory policies kill vulnerable people, that is an indisputable fact,\" said one, ldquovote Tory and you are complicit. Another said without a hint of self-awareness: ldquoI dont have anything to do with right-wingers and Tories and that makes me a better person.\"You literally cant argue with this. Anyway, freedom of speech is now seen as inherently right-wing on social media. And I really cant go on exposing myself to it, not because these arguments blinker me to alternative views, but because they dont.If I am to retain my broad faith in progressive politics, and self-government for Scotland, then abstention is the only option. I need to switch off Twitter before it turns me Tory."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-remember-many-scots-deeply-value-britishness","story":"It is important, however, to remember that since  the Scots grew into also becoming British, particularly after the  Union of the Crowns and the  Treaty of Union of the Parliaments.

The latter word carries with it unwarranted emotional baggage and implies that a nation has been militarily conquered by a foreign power and every lever of governance is directly controlled by that conqueror to the total exclusion of the local population with all decisions being made without reference to those people.Scotland and England were joined by mutual agreement in consensual Acts of Union. The correct term to use is \"secession\" when a country wishes to leave a voluntary union. Compare the Confederates position in the US civil war.

Mr Umunna would eventually join the Liberal Democrats.Labourrsquos Ian Austin quit the party, demoralised by its lack of grip on tackling anti-Semitism an issue that would dog Jeremy Corbynrsquos leadership up to its last days.At Westminster, Theresa Mayrsquos authority was already crumbling by the time she suffered the humiliation of a Commons defeat by  votes the largest for a century.Although the Tory Government survived a subsequent no-confidence vote, the game seemed up.The Remain Alliance slowly began to flex its parliamentary muscles and take control of the Commons agenda as what it regarded as the abyss of a hard Brexit grew ever nearer.Brussels dug in its heels. Michel Barnier, the EUrsquos chief negotiator, made clear on whether the bloc would ever renegotiate the UK-EU deal or change the backstop the answer was the same an emphatic Non.By spring the Government was losing more and more votes Mrs Mayrsquos declaration of Brexit by March  fell by the wayside as did any attempt to leave the EU without a deal.Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of London to call for a Peoplersquos Vote. An online petition to revoke Article  reached five million and then six million. Support for the pro-EU Liberal Democrats began to creep up.More indicative votes were held but failed to be passed. Mrs Mayrsquos deal was defeated for a third time. An attempt at a Conservative-Labour compromise not surprisingly failed. The zombie Parliament, deadlocked, shuffled on.Another push by the Remain Alliance forced the PM to agree an October  extension. On cue, Nigel Farage reappeared to announce he was leading a new party, the Brexit Party.All the while a head of steam was building within Tory ranks to oust the beleaguered Mrs May. The final shove came at an intense meeting of the backbench  committee following a disastrous performance at the local elections in England, when the Tories lost more than , councillors. Boris Johnson swtly threw his hat in the ring.Asthings were not dramatic enough, Donald Trump arrived for a state visit, promising a ldquophenomenal post-Brexit trade deal and insisting everything, including the NHS, would be on the table a tune he would later change. But he once more made clear his preference for Mr Johnsonrsquos candidacy.As the hustings got underway the contest became a straight battle between the out-and-out Brexiteer Mr Johnson and the Remainer-turned-Brexiteer Jeremy Hunt. Given it was the party membership who had the final say, the result never seemed in doubt. The Old Etonian won two to one.After Mrs May gave her teary departure in Downing St, Mr Johnson formed his new Brexiteer Government with former Leave campaign chief Dominic Cummings heading the Downing St backroom team.By now Jo Swinson, at  had become its first female leader. A poll rating of  per cent began to give the Lib Dems hope of a dramatic breakthrough.Over summer, Mr Johnson visited Francersquos Emmanuel Macron, insisting the Brexit impasse could be broken \"with energy and creativity\" a new deal could be sealed by Hallowersquoen.Then in late August the PM dropped his political bombshell he asked the Queen to suspend Parliament until October . Outrage followed from political opponents. Demonstrations were held. Things began to hot up considerably.After he lost his Commons majority thanks to another Tory defection, a bill to block a no-deal was passed with the help of Conservative rebels. Some , including senior figures like Dominic Grieve, Ken Clarke and David Gauke, were sacked. Amber Rudd later resigned in sympathy.The PM suffered a personal blow when his brother Jo left Government, saying he was \"torn between family and the national interest\".After a second attempt to call a snap election failed, Parliament was prorogued amid unprecedented protests in the Commons with some Opposition MPs holding up signs saying \"silenced\".The drama then moved up a gear. Three judges at Scotlandrsquos highest civil court ruled the Governments prorogation of Westminster was unlawful.In Bournemouth at the Lib Dem conference, the party voted to back a policy to revoke Brexitit won a General Election.A week later as Labour held its annual conference in Brighton, the UK Supreme Court made its bombshell announcement it agreed with the Court of Session. A day later MPs were back at Westminster for one of the worst-tempered days in living memory.Mr Johnson branded the law blocking a no-deal Brexit as the ldquoSurrender Bill, which caused Opposition MPs to urge him to tone down his language given the threats against MPs. He denounced the attack as ldquohumbug, later insisting his comments had been misconstrued.As the Tories held their conference, it was overshadowed by claims the PM had had an affair with US model-turned-businesswoman Jenner Arcuri. He continued to deny any conflict of interest.Pressure mounted on Mr Corbyn to call a no-confidence vote in the Government but the reality was he did not have the numbers to succeed.Mr Johnson, who had repeatedly declared Britain would leave the EU on October  ldquono s, no buts, agreed to send a letter to Brussels seeking an extension required under the Benn Act.Yet shortly after Parliament was prorogued again to bring in a Queenrsquos Speech, the UK and EU agreed an historic deal without the notorious backstop but creating a customs border down the Irish Sea. Feeling betrayed, the Democratic Unionists insisted they could not support the new deal.A special Saturday sitting of the Commons was held to discuss it. The extension letter to Brussels was sent but not signed. Within days MPs finally passed the Brexit Bill by a majority of  but failed to agree a timetable.After EU leaders agreed to push back the Brexit deadline again to January , a motion to call a General Election was finally passed.As Parliament was dissolved Labourrsquos deputy leader Tom Watson resigned, saying he wanted to start a new chapter in his le but later would admit that the hostility he had received within the party had helped him make his mind up to leave.The campaign was dominated by the NHS and Brexit.Mr Corbyn made great play of the release of unredacted documents that he insisted showed the NHS would be up for sale in a post-Brexit trade deal with America. Donald Trump, visiting the UK for a Nato summit, strenuously denied the claim, but, seemingly to help his British host, abandoned a planned press conference and quickly ed home.Front page pictures of a boy lying on a hospital floor for hours on end awaiting treatment gave Mr Johnson his most uncomfortable moment as he pocketed the mobile phone of a TV reporter trying to get him to comment on it.But the PM was more comfortable with pictures of him bulldozing a Styrofoam wall with the words Get Brexit Done, his campaign slogan, emblazoned on the machine.While the Tory manesto was light on detail, Labourrsquos was bulging with it. Promises even continued after the latterrsquos publication with a pledge to spend almost pound billion to compensate the Waspi women for changes to their state pensions.In Scotland, the campaign was once again dominated by the constitutional question with Mr Johnson making clear there were ldquono circumstances in which he would facilitate a second independence referendum no matter how many seats the SNP won.In the end, it seemed a combination of questions about Mr Corbynrsquos leadership, Labourrsquos ldquoconfetti of manesto promises and Mr Johnsonrsquos clear commitment to ldquoget Brexit done had helped the Tories smash through Labourrsquos ldquored wall in northern England to secure an -seat majority.Mr Corbyn announced he would stand down, thus sparking a leadership contest. While Ms Swinson, having once declared herself to be her partyrsquos candidate for Prime Minister, saw her party lose one seat to  while she failed to retain her own East Dunbartonshire seat.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, was on a political high. The new Queenrsquos Speech contained a law to make sure the trade deal with the EU would not go beyond December  and MPs passed the first stage of the new Brexit Bill with a majority of . How times had changed.The political drama, the intricacies and the long-term impact of the Brexit debate on le across the UK means that  will go down in history as the most politically turbulent year since the Second World War.

Kids shouting to one another and woman up on the stage with an old piano.\"You didnt know the time - there was no children with a watch.

It began to come into the room and somebody shouted fire, and everybody panicked except me.\"What happened was that the people at the front of the hall ran to the back where there was an exit door.

Thirty years after it was named the first European City of Culture, it has in recent times hosted the Commonwealth Games and the BBC Six Music Festival as well as lining up alongside Berlin to stage the  European Championships. In the year ahead it, just like global cities including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, London and Rome, will host a number of matches for UEFArsquos European Football Championship and will also welcome world leaders to COP , a global climate change summit.Not bad for a city that in  was seen as so scarred by poverty, infirmity and other vestiges of its industrial past that even its own citizens questioned the rationale for choosing it over practically anywhere  as a European cultural capital.The transformation has not come easy, though. A city does not attract high-profile events in a bubble and major businesses like Barclays, which is currently building a hub on the banks of the Clyde, do not choose to create thousands of jobs in a place without discussion. Everything that has happened to Glasgow in the past three decades has happened because of the considerable effort put in by its political leaders as well as representatives of its and Scotlandrsquos business, sporting and cultural communities. They might have spent a bit of public money attending meetings, making contacts and preparing bids - they might even have spent a lot - but considering what the city has got insurely we can all agree it has been money well spent Well, no. Because faced with evidence of the seemingly profligate spending of Glasgow City Councilrsquos deputy leader David McDonald, representatives of opposition parties have declared themselves up in arms. The problem is that in addition to visiting schools, housing developments and local museums, Mr McDonald went on a number of publicly funded trips this year, with visits to Tokyo, Tallinn and Duumlsseldorf among them.Tokyo was to attend the opening of an exhibition of  works from Glasgowrsquos publicly owned Burrell Collection Tallinn was to rub shoulders with other civic leaders at the Estonian national song festival, an event Mr McDonald had been invited to as a representative of a UNESCO City of Music and Duumlsseldorf was to take part in an international summit on social cohesiveness on the invitation of the mayor of Montreal.Yet despite Glasgow working so hard to earn its emerging status as a global city - and despite the obvious advantages attending such events can bring - these were seen as beyond the pale. Conservative MSP Annie Wells reckoned Glaswegians ldquowill be understandably annoyed that an SNP councillor is spending so much of their money on this truly international class of junketing Gary Smith, Scottish secretary of staunch Labour-supporting union the GMB, agreed. ldquoGlasgow council-tax payers will be aghast at this councillorrsquos excesses, he fumed. ldquoThe cityrsquos infrastructure is decrepit, the streets are dirty and there are budget cuts affecting the elderly and vulnerable.Gary Smith does, of course, have a point. Like every other local authority in the country Glasgow City Council has been struggling with budgetary constraints whose effects are plain for all to see. Walk down any street and the filth is astonishing, with the absence of blocked drains, overflowing bins and dog dirt more remarkable than their presence. At the same time, the council is failing so miserably to meet its obligations to house everyone presenting as homeless that it has been placed under review by the Scottish Government, threatened with legal action by homelessness charity Shelter and been made the subject of an inquiry by the Scottish Housing Regulator. The city has its problems, alright, and then some.Yet damning as those and many other issues are, none of that will be solved by the city turning in on itself. Far from this being the time for Glasgowrsquos leaders to hunker down and worry solely about how to cope with shrinking budgets, this is precisely the moment the city should be selling itself on the global stage, using the confidence it has gained over the past  years to attract the kind of investment that will at least give it the opportunity to thrive.To suggest that politicians like Mr McDonald should snub invitations to build international links on the basis that all foreign trips are junkets is small minded in the extreme. It does nothing to address the very real issues Glasgow faces, but does plenty to damage the mature, confident, outward-looking image the city has worked so hard to create.The artist and author Alasdair Gray, whose death at the weekend has left an unimaginable hole in Scotlandrsquos cultural landscape, wrote repeatedly about Glasgowrsquos magnicence and to a large extent it was him who helped shape our recognition and understanding of that. As he had the character Duncan Thaw say in his masterwork Lanark, unless a city has been used by an artist ldquonot even the inhabitants live there imaginatively. ldquoThink of Florence, Paris, London, New York, the character said. ldquoNobody visiting them for the first time is a stranger because hersquos already visited them in paintings, novels, history books and films.Alasdair Grayrsquos books and drawings, murals and poems have helped elevate Glasgow into the kind of city its inhabitants are proud to live in and whose visitors feel no strangeness in. Our civic leaders have a duty not just to nurture that legacy but to develop it too.Sure Glasgow has problems with potholes and cleanliness, homelessness and drug addiction, but Tory politicians and Labour-soaked unions are wrongthey think that public funds should be spent on fixing that and that alone. Glasgow has earned the right to host events and exhibitions that will play a part in its future prosperity, but its leaders have had to work hard for that - and not just in the City Chambers. To suggest otherwise displays a stunning lack of imagination."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-need-independence-improve-lives-impoverished","story":"I am not a ldquokilts, haggis and shortbread nationalist. To me the Declaration of Arbroath is as irrelevant as is the date  its done, forget it, lets look forwards not back. I believe Scotland should control its destiny simply because the common man would stand a better chance of having a decent le out from under Westminsterrsquos control. As part of the wider UK, we Scots live in a Union which is experiencing increasing levels of poverty, homelessness and declining le-expectancy, where the hard-earned egalitarian social improvements gained after two world wars are gradually being rolled back by the Establishment. We suffer under a UK system of governance that is happy to pay eight per cent of total government tax revenue in interest to the bankers while failing to address large-scale tax evasion and avoidance facilitated by that sector. A political environment where lies, obfuscation and the deliberate withholding or suppression of information are commonplace. A system that rewards obedient, compliant MPs rejected by the electorate at the ballot box with le peerages and awards a knighthood to a minister who introduced social welfare changes that had a devastating effect on those least able to object.Thousands of Scots are now forced to rely on charity food banks simply to survive, kids go to school hungry and poorly clothed and in this age of supposed enlightenment the major factor determining onersquos future le is still simply the bed you are born in.Those are some of the reasons why Scotland needs independence because as long as we are shackled to Westminster things simply cannot and will not change. That is also why Scottish Labour needs to get off the fence and support the cause.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.IAN W Thomsonclaims that there are many Scots who ldquodeeply value their Britishness. That, indeed, is the problem. Far too many of them are indferent to the fact that England dominates the Westminster Parliament by a long way and Scotland will always come second best in this political context. I place a high value on my European identity and have had it snatched away from me by a bunch of right-wing zealots in England, despite my country voting to remain in the European Union.Britishness may be important to Mr. Thomson but, for me, it stands for an arrogant and self-satisfied political system which may have had an empire but whose supporters still donrsquot realise that all that \"glory\" is over and done with.

As this was playing, I read in todays Heraldthe letters from Ian W Thomson, Stefan Slater and Tim Ryan in particular, where comment is made on Britishness and the -year-old Union of the nations of England and Scotland.I have written before on this matter pointing out that as a child in the s and s I was raised and educated to be British with Scottishness being a reduced status, with for example playground Scots being termed \"slang\" and being told that it must not be used. In my working le I came across many examples of Scotland being considered as a part of England and English colleagues rarely,ever, thinking of themselves as British. Then, a few years ago I read Arthur Hermans book on the Scottish Enlightenment. In this he states that many Scots at the forefront of this movement took to referring to themselves as North Britons he notes that no English academic referred to themselves as South Britons, and that the Scots knew it.If our United Kingdom can sort this out there may be a future for a United Kingdom of Great Britain, populated by British people. But how many generations will this take  And the onus is on England to start this movement before they lose their so-called \"precious Union\".Ian Gray, Croftamie.ALASDAIR Gallowaydismisses the once in a generation referendum promise by repeating the old canard that it was merely a throwaway comment, and thus presumably is of no account. That promise was made by none other than the then First Minister Alex Salmond in the lead up to the  referendum in his Preface to the Scottish Governmentrsquos own publication entitled Scotlandrsquos Future, in which he made it clear that the  referendum was to be a once in a generation opportunity to vote for independence.

It means Scotland will be the first UK country to outlaw smacking and will give young people the same protection from assault as adults.A consultation on Mr Finniersquos bill was widely supported by childrenrsquos charities however opponents have argued that the law already protected children from assault and the ban risked criminalising lsquogood parentsrsquo for using reasonable chastisement.It has been likened by some opponents to the Scottish Governmentrsquos failed lsquonamed personsrsquo legislation which was ditched following criticism that it could place ordinary families under undue scrutiny.The new research by campaign group Be Reasonable received  responses from  Scottish councillors, representing % of the countryrsquos local councillors.Despite claims that the survey is too small to be reliable, the group says it spotlights a deep ide between the views of local politicians and Holyrood.It also warns that while the law change could see increased pressure on social services and a need for extra training for teachers and health workers, there has so far been no indication that the Scottish Government plans to release funds to help cover additional costs.Be Reasonable spokesman Jamie Gillies, said: ldquoThree-quarters of councillors who completed the survey felt local authorities will not cope with additional pressures brought about by a change in the law.ldquoCrucially, social workers ndash who are already cracking under the pressure of identying and helping vulnerable children ndash are also thought to be unable to cope.ldquoMany councillors seem aghast at the prospect of a smacking ban which would tie up social workers, deplete local authority resources and affect services for years to come when there is no reliable evidence to show that mild physical discipline is harmful to children.ldquoWhen signicant numbers of councillors in all of the main parties oppose legislation the Government should take notice.The survey claims seven in  councillors think parents should be allowed to use reasonable chastisement on their children. A similar number do not think smacking should become a criminal offence.While only the Scottish Conservatives opposed the bill in Holyrood, the survey suggests half of SNP and Lib Dem councillors who responded agree that parents should be permitted to use reasonable chastisement with their children. The numbers were higher among Labourand Conservative .Meanwhile, more than seven in  councillors felt the Government should finance the implications of a smacking ban ldquoas fully as necessary over time and provide ldquopublic assurances that no other frontline services will be affected as a consequence of the Bill erting resources.According to Be Reasonable responses to the survey from councillors suggests confusion over how the smacking ban might work, with one apparently unclear over whether the new law would apply to foreign tourists and another raising concerns that it may lead to family disputes and unproven allegations.One councillor commented that ldquosomeneed a quick, harmless smack on the leg or bottom to save them from harm, while another raised concerns that the legislation is ldquooverly heavy-handed and is not proportionate to the issue.Others raised concerns over the extra workload for police and social services, with one commenting: ldquoAs usual with Scottish Government, they will simply pass the buck to hard-pressed local authorities, as they have with so many other subjects.ldquoIf they want this it must be fully resourced out of their annual underspend.Responding to the survey, Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoItrsquos typical of the SNP to rush through a headline-grabbing law without thinking about the consequences.ldquoThe Nationalists were well-warned about these challenges but blundered on regardless.ldquoNow we have a situation where the SNP is creating criminals of ordinary parents and placing immense pressure on council services which are already struggling to cope.Childrenrsquos Minister Maree Todd said: ldquoThe Act gives children, without exception, the same protection from assault as adults.ldquoThis is backed by an overwhelming majority of public opinion and commanded support from a wide range of Scottish society including the Church of Scotland, Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, the Royal College of Paediatrics  Child Health , Children First and Barnardorsquos.ldquoWe are working in partnership with organisations including local authorities, childrenrsquos charities, Social Work Scotland and Police Scotland to raise awareness of the Act and build on the existing support we offer to children and families."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-reassures-eu-citizens-new-year-message","story":"The First Minister highlighted theUN climate change summit in Glasgow in November as key date for the year ahead, which she said would give Scotland the chance to show it is leading by example.Addressing the UKrsquos scheduled exit from the EU in January, the SNP leader sought to reassure EU citizens and said the Scottish Government would work towards giving people the opportunity to ldquodetermine Scotlandrsquos future.:Nicola Sturgeon lsquoshowboatingrsquo instead of fixing public services, opposition claimldquoAs we celebrate the start of  and a new decade, we look forward to a year in which Scotland will be at the centre of international attention, she said.ldquoIn November, the United Nations climate change summit in Glasgow will attract more than , people from around the world.ldquoHopefully that summit will lead to progress in tackling the most important issue that the world faces.ldquoAnd it will give Scotland a chance to show that we are leading by example ndash not just by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions but by doing so in a way that helps to build a fairer, healthier and happier society.The First Minister added:ldquoThe Glasgow summit comes near the end of what will be a historic year.ldquoAgainst the wishes of most people in Scotland, we will leave the European Union at the end of January.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm who can consign the jeremy corbyn era to the dustbin of history","story":"The last thing Labour needs is continuity in its quest for a leader who isn#t embarrassed to be a patriot, says Euan McColmWhen Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party in , he promised a new kind of politics. He certainly delivered that.Now in the grip of a hard-left cabal, Corbyn’s party is a sectarian mess, a safe place for anti-Semites and crank conspiracists. But the leader of the Opposition hasn’t succeeded only in creating a new kind of politics. He has also introduced a new way of losing elections.Clinging to leadershipThere was a time when a leader so comprehensively humiliated in a general election would have resigned immediately, offering profound apologies to all in his party who had been failed by him.Corbyn’s dferent kind of defeat has involved him clinging on to the leadership, arguing – pathetically – that Labour won the argument, and seeing that the advisers who directed the party’s election disaster are signed up to permanent contracts, protecting them from the fate – redundancy – that is now befalling scores of junior staffers.Corbyn says he is remaining in place so that the party can go through a period of reflection on its defeat. Once it is clear what went wrong, he’ll shuffle off and a leadership election will tasked place.This is all bulls**t, of course. Ask any Labour activist why the party lost the general election and,they are honest, they will tell you that the party’s biggest problem was Corbyn. Time and again while canvassing, candidates were told by voters – many of whom had backed Labour all their lives – that they simply couldn’t support the party while he was in charge. Among the reasons were anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, a manesto full of promises that appeared wildly unaffordable, and the leader’s record of siding – throughout history – with the United Kingdom’s enemies.Scottish LabourNow, we witness the pitul efforts of Labour members to persuade themselves that among those who are tipped to run for the top job there are credible candidates who will turn round the party’s fortunes.Labour in Scotland has been in crisis for more than a decade. The SNP has slipped into the political space once occupied by its opponents.But south of the border, things are not yet so bleak for Labour.This will soon changemembers make a foolish decision when it comes to choosing the new leader.In the immediate aftermath of the general election, there was much chatter about the need for Labour to choose a leader who was both northern and female. The logic ran that voters who had turned their nose up at a London-based leader would the leader was someone with whom they could more easily identy.This is nonsense. Voters in the north of England who turned from Corbyn decided to put their faith in Boris Johnson. The flatness of the Labour leader’s vowels has nothing to do with their decision.The Corbyn continuity candidate in the coming leadership election campaign will probably be the wholly unimpressive Rebecca Long Bailey, a northerner who was  per cent behind the sainted Jeremy, even when it was clear he was unfit for office.The importance of patriotismLong Bailey will face challenges from Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, neither of whom has done much to make one think they can turn Labour’s fortunes around. Both seem as distant from the voting public as Corbyn ever did. And both, I’m afraid, are tainted by playing central roles in supporting the Corbyn project which has been so roundly rejected by the electorate.Labour’s media outriders, those columnists and pundits who made careers out of excusing Corbyn’s associations with terrorists and his failure to deal adequately with anti-Semitism, really struggle to deal with the popularity of Johnson with a signicant number of working class voters.At the heart of their confusion lies one of the big problems with the Corbyn project – the failure of its adherents to recognise the importance of patriotism. In dismissing anyone who declares even the slightest affection for the country of their birth as a petty nationalist, the Corbynista offends the small “c” conservative voter who thinks the UK has often been a force for good.Accepting this reality is crucial to the Labour Party’s survival.Swathes of the Labour membership will continue to delude themselves that their man won the argument and that what is needed is a new face to present ideas put forward by Corbyn.But smarter activists will think carefully about how Labour can rebuild a connection with voters who have abandoned the party. The first step in this process is accepting that Labour cannot expect the voters to come to the party. Rather, the party must go to them.Social democratThe new leader should be a social democrat rather than a revolutionary socialist, someone who isn’t ashamed to sing the national anthem, and someone who is as untainted as it is possible to be by association with Corbyn.Were I a member of the Labour Party with a vested interest in its survival, I’d be encouraging Dan Jarvis to step forward. Jarvis, a former soldier, was spoken about as a possible challenger for the leadership when Ed Miliband quit in .Instead of stepping into that fight, Jarvis – MP for Barnsley Central – turned his attention to his local area, campaigning successfully to become mayor of the Sheffield City Region.Jarvis succeeded in the mayoral battle on his own terms, without the patronage of Corbyn.Recently, Jarvis said it was time for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era. That politics had failed, he said, and it was time to start rebuilding credibility.Unsurprisingly, Corbynistas were horried by Jarvis’s remarks. He is not one of them, after all, and is therefore to be treated with a mixture of suspicion and contempt.But Jarvis was right. Labour’s credibility has been shot to Hell by Jeremy Corbyn and a fresh start is essential.If Dan Jarvis does enter the leadership race, he’ll start as an outsider, buthe can reach out beyond the party to the general public and win opinion poll support, he may force Labour members to ask themselves whether it’s time to think about how they start winning again.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"church leaders disappointed with premature removal of edinburgh nativity sculpture for johnnie walker advertising","story":"The removal of a nativity sculpture to make way for Johnnie Walker whisky advertising figurines just two days after Christmas has been criticised by church leaders.Tradition dictates that decorations can be left up for the  days of Christmas and are only taken down or removed on the Epiphany on January .: Edinburghs Nativity scene replaced by a Johnnie Walker whisky advert for HogmanayBut organisers of the Capitalrsquos official festivities have felled the giant Christmas tree on the Mound and replaced its neighbouring Nativity sculpture scene with a series of lsquoJohnnie Walkerrsquo figures, which feature on bottles of the blended whisky.The Nativity sculpture was at one stage left lying on the grass, prompting an angry response on social media.And the Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews  Edinburgh said it was ldquodisappointed at the move.A spokesman said: ldquoThe Nativity scene brought home the true meaning of Christmas in a brilliant location and wersquore disappointed at its premature removal along with the Christmas tree from their position on The Mound.Hogmanay event organisers Underbelly insist the tree - a traditional gt from Norway - had been removed before January  in previous years to make way for a giant television screen and had to be taken down for safety reasons.Underbelly added that the Nativity - previously in St Andrew Square - was removed on January  this year.Not the spirit of ChristmasHowever, Councillor Iain Whyte, leader of the Tory group on Edinburgh City Council, said:ldquoI have every sympathy for those who are upset by the removal of these traditional Christmas items - the Nativity scene, in particular, given it represents the point from Jesusrsquo birth for Christians through to the  days of Nativity.Cllr Whyte said he recalled years gone by when the tree was kept in place into January.He added: ldquoHaving it put up later and removed earlier almost as an afterthought doesnrsquot seem to be in the spirit of Christmas.The row was sparked after a number of photographs emerged on social media of the spruce reduced to a sawn-off stump.Hospital chaplain Mark Evans tweeted ldquoWhat has happened to our Christmas Tree ldquoThe tree on the mound is a GIFT to the people of Edinburgh.

There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

The previous biggest increase was in April , when the rate rose by p from £. to £. per hour.The new rate starts on April   and will result in an increase of £ over the year for a full-time worker on the national living wage.: Eleanor Mannion:  years of the National Minimum WageHowever the rise has been criticised for both being too little, and for \"piling further pressure\" on businesses.The national living wage is the name for the minimum wage level payable to adults over the age of .

Younger workers who receive the minimum wage will see their pay boosted between . per cent and . per cent depending on their age, with  to -year-olds seeing a p increase from £. to £. an hour.The Prime Minister welcomed the \"biggest ever cash boost to the national living wage\", and added: \"Hard work should always pay, but, for too long, people havent seen the pay rises they deserve.\"Our government will put a stop to that, giving nearly three million people from Edinburgh to Eastbourne a well-earned pay rise, including the biggest ever cash boost to the national living wage.\"But thats not all. As we enter a new decade, were setting our sights higher, to help people earn more over the next five years and level up access to opportunity across our great country.\": Tories say they are workers party with £. minimum wage pledgeHowever while Scottish Government Fair Work Minister Jamie Hepburn said he welcomed any increase to workers’ hourly rate of pay, he said todays announcement did \"not go far enough.\"He said: “The UK National Living Wage is still not a real Living Wage - even for those who will receive the full rate – and it cannot be right that workers aged  to  receive a lower rate of pay.“That is why the Scottish Government supports the payment of the real Living Wage of £. per hour. Unlike the UK National Living Wage, this is a minimum rate which applies to all workers over the age of .“While pay legislation remains reserved to the UK Government, we continue to encourage every organisation, regardless of size, sector or location to ensure all staff receive a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work.”And Frances OGrady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called for a £-per-hour national living wage. She added: \"This is a long-planned raise, but its also long overdue.\"Workers are still not getting a fair share of the wealth they create.

There are still over five million workers in the UK earning less than the real living wage and many families will have struggled with extra costs over the holidays, so this increase in the minimum wage provides a vital pay boost.\"However, there is a still a gap between the government minimum and the real living wage, independently calculated based on what it costs to live.\"Business organisations warned against the rise, which they said was \"piling further pressure\" on companies struggling in a time of economic uncertainty.Hannah Essex, co-executive director at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Businesses want to pay their staff a good wage. They recognise and support the drive to improve living standards. But many have struggled with increased costs in a time of great economic uncertainty.\"Raising wage floors by more than double the rate of inflation will pile further pressure on cashflow and eat into training and investment budgets. For this policy to be sustainable, Government must offset these costs by reducing others, and impose a moratorium on any further upfront costs for business.\"Craig Beaumont, Federation of Small Businesses director of external affairs and advocacy, urged the Government to implement pro-business measures ahead of the next financial year.He said: \"This Government has promised a reduction in the jobs tax through an increase in the employment allowance.\"With a national living wage increase of this size now on the horizon, its critical that it delivers swtly, particularly with small business confidence plumbing new depths ahead of the election. We need this support announced in good time ahead of Aprils increase so small businesses can plan ahead.\": How firms can take a responsible business approach to financial wellbeing in the workforceChancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid hailed the rise, and said the wages of the lowest-paid full-time workers have increased by £, since the national living wage was introduced in .He added: \"But we want to do more to level up and tackle the cost of living, which is why the national living wage will increase further to £. by  on current forecasts.\"In September, when the Chancellor first announced the increase, he said the national living wage would rise towards two-thirds of median earnings by , \"provided economic conditions allow\", to about £. per hour.The government said nearly three million workers are set to benefit from the increases and it is \"on track\" to meet its current target for the NLW to reach  per cent of median earnings by .Nye Cominetti, an economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation think tank, welcomed the increase but warned it is \"not risk-free\". He said: \"This latest ramping up of the legal wage floor will boost the pay packets of millions of workers.\"With the government committed to delivering one of the highest wage floors in the world by , we are set for another parliament of big pay rises for the UKs lowest earners of around five per cent a year.\"This ambition is welcome but not risk-free.

So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"ninian scoops window prize for second year running ","story":"There were winners galore in Lerwick town centre on Monday as the top Christmas window was announced and the Elf trail came to an end.Ninian staff receive the trophy for the best Christmas window.

Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Heartbroken son’s emotional tribute to his road victim father...his ‘rock’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"lisburn and castlereagh council spends 462k","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The polling found that % of respondents believe hunting live deer with dogs should be made illegal, while % felt hunting foxes with dogs should be banned.Some % of people also thought the practice of using dogs to hunt live animals is illegal in Northern Ireland, while % thought it is legal and % did not know.Janice Watt, senior affairs officer for the League Against Cruel Sports in Northern Ireland, said that most people in Northern Ireland find the hunting with dogs \"repulsive\".\"With polling showing widespread opposition to this so-called ‘sport’, it’s clear that hunting should be made illegal in Northern Ireland, and the League is working hard to ensure that as soon as Stormont sits again we get a ban to bring our nation into line with the rest of the UK,\" she said.\"If most of the public think the barbaric practice of hunting with dogs is banned, they are sadly mistaken. Animals are still being chased and literally torn apart and this is still legal.\"It’s time to end hunting with dogs in Northern Ireland and we’re calling on politicians from across the political spectrum to support our campaign.\"While many politicians in Northern Ireland have spoken out against hunting with dogs, others support of the practice.DUP MP Jim Shannon is an avid fan of the annual Boxing Day Hunt that leaves from the de Winters Complex in Newtownards and said the event is more about pageantry and socialising.\"The traditional Boxing Day hunt has been leaving from de Winters in Newtownards all my le and brings families together,\" he said.\"The horses, the hounds, the red coats, the sounds of the bugles, its a wonderful occasion for those involved and those coming along to watch.\"No fox has been caught in years and thats not the point of these events.

Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes. The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

Doubling the numbers in Irish-medium education is a big challenge but we can meet that ambition head on by creating the right foundations in our naionrai.“We should also be looking at ways to deepen community engagement around Irish-medium early years and schools.“I think we also need to look at incentives to attract students from Gaeltacht areas to teaching and how we can increase the supply of those with a high standard of Irish to work in Irish-medium education settings across the board.  We can also consider how we can improve opportunities for gaelscoileanna to expand.”The policy will be developed in collaboration with other relevant departments including the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.The work will be overseen by an inter-departmental steering committee and supported by an advisory committee comprised of relevant stakeholders.The Minister added: “This new policy for Irish-medium education will raise the profile of our language in our communities and I believe it will also encourage the daily use of Irish inside and outside our schools.”"},{"url":null,"title":"carney spent almost 100000 on final governors","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There was a fire at the reception area near the compound’s car park but it was unclear what had caused it. A man on a loudspeaker urged the mob not to enter the compound, saying: “The message was delivered.”Donald Trump blamed Iran for the embassy breach and called on Iraq to protect the diplomatic mission.The US president tweeted: “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. “In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notied!” \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Protesters smash a window inside the compound There were no reports of casualties, but the unprecedented breach was one of the worst attacks on the embassy in recent memory. It followed US air strikes on Sunday that killed  fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The US military said the air strikes were in retaliation for last week’s killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that it blamed on the militia.The developments represent a major downturn in Iraq-US relations that could further undermine American influence in the region and weaken Washington’s hand in its campaign against Iran.Iraq has long struggled to balance its ties with the US and Iran, both allies of the Iraqi government, but the government’s angry reaction to the US air strikes and its apparent decision not to prevent the protesters from reaching the embassy signalled a sharp deterioration of relations.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Protesters damage property inside the compound Iraqi security forces made no effort to stop the protesters as they marched to the heavily fortied Green Zone after a funeral held for those killed in the US strikes, letting them pass through a security checkpoint leading to the area.The mob of marchers, many of them in militia unorms, shouted “Down, Down USA!” and “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” outside the compound, hurling water and stones over its walls. The mob set fire to three trailers used by security guards along the wall. Others then smashed the gates used by cars to enter and dozens pushed into the compound. The protesters stopped in a corridor after about  metres and were only about  metres away from the main building. Half a dozen US soldiers were seen on the roof of the main building, their guns pointed at the protesters, and smoke from the tear gas rose in the area.The protesters raised yellow militia flags and taunted the embassy’s security staff who remained behind the windows in the gates’ reception area. They hung a poster on the wall declaring, “America is an aggressor” and sprayed graffiti on the wall and windows.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The compound is inside the fortied Green Zone An Iraqi employee at the embassy told the AP that the embassy’s security team had evacuated some local staff from a rear gate while others left by helicopter as the rest remained inside “safe” areas within the embassy. Some commanders of militia factions loyal to Iran joined the protesters. Among them was Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the state-sanctioned paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Units, the umbrella group for the Iran-backed militias.At least three protesters appeared to have dficulties breathing from tear gas. No one was immediately reported hurt in the rampage, and security staff had withdrawn to inside the embassy earlier, soon after protesters gathered outside. The US air strikes — the largest targeting an Iraqi state-sanctioned militia in recent years — and the subsequent calls by the militia for retaliation, represent a new escalation in the proxy war between the US and Iran playing out in the Middle East.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday’s strikes sent the message that Washington will not tolerate actions by Iran that jeopardise American lives."},{"url":null,"title":"505020","story":"MARCH  Bloody Sunday families vow to fight on for justiceThe families of those killed on Bloody Sunday vowed to continue their quest for justice after it was confirmed only one British paratrooper would face murder charges.The Director Public Prosecution informed the families that Soldier F would be charged with the murders of James Wray and William McKinney, two of those who lost their lives, and that he would face prosecution for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn, four of the  injured.Following the announcement, the families and the surviving injured gathered in the citys Guildhall for a press conference.Following a minutes silence, John Kelly, whose -years-old brother Michael was one of those shot dead, said: “I was going to start by saying good morning, but it is not.“We have been denied our human rights again.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in . Among others who have recorded it are Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Chieftains, Daniel ODonnell, The Seekers, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Petula Clark, Jethro Tull, Sineacutead OConnor and Sufjan Stevens, St. Pauls Choir School and most recently by the Irish group Celtic Woman in their album Voices of Angels.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For the third year running and back by popular demand, Roy Arbuckle is joined by his frequent collaborator, singer Anne Tracey, for an acoustic afternoon of music, song and poetry at the Seamus Heaney Home Place on January th between pm and pm. Says Roy, “ The poetry of Seamus Heaney has always captured my attention. Often Heaney manages to say with a touching sensitivity and brilliant eloquence the kinds of things I am also trying to say through my own song writing. His is truly poetry ‘for the soul’. To be invited to play at the Heaney Home Place for this the third January running is a special honour and a thrill.” googletag.cmd.push During their afternoon gig, Anne and Roy will feature tracks from their “Songs for the Soul” CD as well as songs from artists as ious as Judy Collins, Tom Waits and the late and much mourned, Eamon Friel. Anne explained: “Both of us are delighted to be joined by that fabulous musician and arranger, “the maestro” Eddie O Donnell on keys and guitar as well as by my brother, Michael Corey, a mighty singer with a wide repertoire of songs.” Anne Tracey is well known for her very successful annual City of Derry Jazz festival shows. Like Roy she too is delighted and honoured by the invitation to sing at the Heaney Home Place. “The six of us are all looking forward to performing together.” she said. “We have chosen a set-list which includes both original and traditional songs, songs we hope will touch the hearts of the audience gathered in the Heaney Home Place just a couple of weeks into the new year, songs with a story to them, songs that explore the pull of ‘ home’ ‘identity and ‘place’ and songs with a bit of craic to them. googletag.cmd.push “Though I have lived in Derry for a long number of years, for me it is special to be performing in such a magnicent venue so close to my own home town of Moneymore. And I am thrilled that my brother, Brendan Corey, is making a pilgimage to the Heaney Home Place all the way from Long Island, New York. Brendan has been singing and playing professionally in New York for over forty years but has joined us for a few songs over the past three years. He is truly smitten by the atmosphere and audience reception in the Heaney Home Place.” Tickets available on line or by ringing  .

The  new entry level paid internships will offer young people the chance to gain real on-the-job experience to kick-start their careers in the creative industries. TheNI Creative Employment Programmewill work with employers to establish brand new posts in order to give people opportunities in thearts and cultural sector. Creative industry businesses in Derry are encouraged to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to add to their teams. Funded by theArts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the programme will provide part funding to cover wage costs for employers who create the new jobs and hire a young person aged -. googletag.cmd.push Run by Creative  Cultural Skills NI, the project aims tosupport the next generation of arts and cultural professionals and enable the growth of the sector by directly addressing skills gaps and shortages. “We want to offer greater paid opportunities to young people with the aim of eventually eradicating unpaid internships, which are so prevalent in this sector. Budgets are very tight in this sector so by offering additional funding, this programme will not only help organisations create new, exciting positions but also allow for fairer opportunities to young people,” explained Sarah Jones of Creative  Cultural Skills NI. NICEP ran as a two year pilot programme initially and this highlighted the demand for support by both industry and iniduals with  creative businesses creating  apprentices and paid intern opportunities over that period. googletag.cmd.push Meacuteabh Rooney was a past participant on the programme, securing an internship with the NI Science Festival as a Marketing and Events Intern in . With a university degree in geography, she was working in retail when she spotted the post and applied for it. “The programme gave me a chance to get my first job in the creative sector. I never would have thought of event management as a career but I love it. I was hired back in  and for the upcoming festival and this year they are giving me the opportunity to take the lead in programming two big events so I’m continually learning and developing,” she explained. The organisation also benefitted from the NICEP funding and support. Chris McCreery, director of the Science Festival, explained: “We simply could never have done this without the support. It’s been hugely beneficial to us not just to have an extra team member but to have a new perspective by this smart, engaged young person. She quickly became a valued member of the team who has contributed so much to the festival.” The programme will support new jobs from a wide range of fields including music, dance, drama, literature, visual arts, craft, festivals, arts venues, community arts, galleries, museums, circus and carnival arts but will also accept applications from the wider creative sector including digital, film and TV. Employers looking to grow their staff teams and offer an opportunity to a young person, should contact the NI Creative Employment Programme team for more information. Roisin McDonough, Chief Executive of the Arts Council, said: “We want to encourage our talented young people to see the working in the arts as an attractive career option. The NI Creative Employment Programme was created to provide quality training and mentoring opportunities, to give fair access to careers in the creative and cultural industries, and help bolster the creative sector by harnessing the talent of the next generation.” For more information go towww.ccskills.org.ukor emailnicep@ccskills.org.uk  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been a horrible festive period for Sean Connor’s men, two home defeats against teams in and around them at the foot of the table making the league table very bleak reading heading into . Even more concerning than the result was the performance again, a disappointing display against Warrenpoint followed up by a lacklustre display that was bereft of confidence, with Carrick gted two early goals to make this and long and fruitless day for the players in blue. googletag.cmd.push ‘Stute now travel to Linfield on New Year’s Day, and they do so level with Warrenpoint at the foot of the table, with only goal dference, and a signicant lack of confidence separating the two sides. Warning signs The warning signs were there for ‘Stute before the opening goal as Carrick looked the brighter of the two teams, Lee Chapman finding himself in a promising shooting position on the edge of the area but he dallied a moment longer than he should have and the shot was charged down. But Carrick, who had failed to score a goal since defeating ‘Stute earlier in the month, got the opener on  minutes when Kyle Cherry linked with Lloyd Anderson in the area and the latter was afforded too much space just six yards from goal, heading into the empty net after Rory Brown had parried his first effort. googletag.cmd.push  Carrick Rangers Stewart Nixon is closed down by Institutes Shaun Leppard. ‘Stute tried to respond but they could well have fallen two goals behind when a long thro into the area led to miscommunication between Brown and Shaun Leppard, with the centre-half flicking a header past his own goalkeeper right across goal with everyone in blue relieved that the ball did not find the net. ‘Stute began to bother Carrick after  minutes and whilst Cormac Burke may have been overly ambitious in his attempt at goal from wide on the left, it did lead to a corner from which Conor Tourish came so close to levelling, his glancing header just wide of the target. Yet just when it seemed that ‘Stute were getting into the game. A mistake at the back cost them dearly as Dean Curry failed to intercept a simple ball and Lee Chapman went clear down the right before firing a low cross to the back post where Reece Neale arrived with a simple tap in for -. ‘Stute boss Sean Connor responded to that by making a substitution after just  minutes, Adam Green on for a clearly disappointed Shaun Leppard. The remainder of the half was all effort without reward for ‘Stute with Joe McCready doing his best to make something happen, but it was Carrick who looked the more dangerous regardless. The visitor came so close to making it - just before the break when Brown hesitated coming off his line and as a result he came off second best in a challenge with Stewart Nixon. The loose ball broke to Chapman in the area and he thought he had scored until young Jack Bradley arrived in the nick of time to clear the ball off the line. Half Time - The introduction of Jamie Dunne just after the break gave ‘Stute some more energy and le in attack, the winger announcing his arrival with a brilliant and determined run into the penalty area before dinking a cross over goalkeeper Ben Nicholl but Joe McCready was unable to capitalise. The greater threat remained with Carrick as the game went on however and when Caolan Loughran headed down into a packed penalty area, the ball was cleared, but only to Neale lurking outside the area and his ambitious effort had to be plucked out of the air by Brown.  Institutes Graham Crown under pressure from Carrick Rangers Lloyd Anderson.  It just never looked like happening for ‘Stute with the energy and endeavour all shown by the players in white and they got the killer goal on  minutes when substitute Guillaume Keke broke down the right, won the race to the ball ahead of goalkeeper Brown and he passed across the face of the empty goal for Stewart Nixon to tap in for a simple but important goal. ‘Stute, to their credit, kept going and good work from McCready carved out a chance for Dunne inside the area, but in a moment which summed up their day, the ball beat Nicholl but rolled the wrong side of the post. It was nonetheless, the closest that ‘Stute came all day,  minutes into the game. ‘Stute’s best chances came when the game was over as a contest, but they could have had a consolation when Cormac Burke crossed for Graham Crown, and his ing header was just past the upright, much to the midfielder’s disappointment.  FINAL WHISTLE Man of the MatchReece Neale scored a fine second goal and was eager to add to his tally throughout. He added a real attacking dimension to the Carrick attack, and he did so from full back. Moment of the MatchThe first goal in this one was always going to be signicant especially for the confidence boost it would give, and it deservedly went to Carrick after an energetic start. Lloyd Anderson needed two attempts before he got his goal but he was in so much space it hardly mattered. Key BattleJoe McCready never let his head drop, and when he got the ball he was always looking to make things happen. Mark Surgeoner was kept on his toes as a result in what was an interesting battle between the striker and the defender.

It has been a horrible festive period for Sean Connor’s men, two home defeats against teams in and around them at the foot of the table making the league table very bleak reading heading into . Even more concerning than the result was the performance again, a disappointing display against Warrenpoint followed up by a lacklustre display that was bereft of confidence, with Carrick gted two early goals to make this and long and fruitless day for the players in blue. googletag.cmd.push ‘Stute now travel to Linfield on New Year’s Day, and they do so level with Warrenpoint at the foot of the table, with only goal dference, and a signicant lack of confidence separating the two sides. Warning signs The warning signs were there for ‘Stute before the opening goal as Carrick looked the brighter of the two teams, Lee Chapman finding himself in a promising shooting position on the edge of the area but he dallied a moment longer than he should have and the shot was charged down. But Carrick, who had failed to score a goal since defeating ‘Stute earlier in the month, got the opener on  minutes when Kyle Cherry linked with Lloyd Anderson in the area and the latter was afforded too much space just six yards from goal, heading into the empty net after Rory Brown had parried his first effort. googletag.cmd.push  Carrick Rangers Stewart Nixon is closed down by Institutes Shaun Leppard. ‘Stute tried to respond but they could well have fallen two goals behind when a long thro into the area led to miscommunication between Brown and Shaun Leppard, with the centre-half flicking a header past his own goalkeeper right across goal with everyone in blue relieved that the ball did not find the net. ‘Stute began to bother Carrick after  minutes and whilst Cormac Burke may have been overly ambitious in his attempt at goal from wide on the left, it did lead to a corner from which Conor Tourish came so close to levelling, his glancing header just wide of the target. Yet just when it seemed that ‘Stute were getting into the game. A mistake at the back cost them dearly as Dean Curry failed to intercept a simple ball and Lee Chapman went clear down the right before firing a low cross to the back post where Reece Neale arrived with a simple tap in for -. ‘Stute boss Sean Connor responded to that by making a substitution after just  minutes, Adam Green on for a clearly disappointed Shaun Leppard. The remainder of the half was all effort without reward for ‘Stute with Joe McCready doing his best to make something happen, but it was Carrick who looked the more dangerous regardless. The visitor came so close to making it - just before the break when Brown hesitated coming off his line and as a result he came off second best in a challenge with Stewart Nixon. The loose ball broke to Chapman in the area and he thought he had scored until young Jack Bradley arrived in the nick of time to clear the ball off the line. Half Time - The introduction of Jamie Dunne just after the break gave ‘Stute some more energy and le in attack, the winger announcing his arrival with a brilliant and determined run into the penalty area before dinking a cross over goalkeeper Ben Nicholl but Joe McCready was unable to capitalise. The greater threat remained with Carrick as the game went on however and when Caolan Loughran headed down into a packed penalty area, the ball was cleared, but only to Neale lurking outside the area and his ambitious effort had to be plucked out of the air by Brown.  Institutes Graham Crown under pressure from Carrick Rangers Lloyd Anderson.  It just never looked like happening for ‘Stute with the energy and endeavour all shown by the players in white and they got the killer goal on  minutes when substitute Guillaume Keke broke down the right, won the race to the ball ahead of goalkeeper Brown and he passed across the face of the empty goal for Stewart Nixon to tap in for a simple but important goal. ‘Stute, to their credit, kept going and good work from McCready carved out a chance for Dunne inside the area, but in a moment which summed up their day, the ball beat Nicholl but rolled the wrong side of the post. It was nonetheless, the closest that ‘Stute came all day,  minutes into the game. ‘Stute’s best chances came when the game was over as a contest, but they could have had a consolation when Cormac Burke crossed for Graham Crown, and his ing header was just past the upright, much to the midfielder’s disappointment.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening. Bredaghrsquos John Devaney becomes the st holder of the countyrsquos main position, having been selected unopposed to succeed Mayobridge man Sean Rooney.In his first address to delegates, Mr Devaney outlined a strategic vision for the association in the county and a number of areas of focus for his term of office.The key priorities will be the proposed Centre of Excellence, the development of a new coaching plan, recruitment of referees, and a programme to encourage and nurture new and young administrators.Following his election, Devaney said: ldquoThe Ballykinlar Centre of Excellence is clearly the single biggest project that we will have undertaken, and will take time and resource to bring to fruition. ldquoWe have set out our intention and we are determined that it will happen, because it is a fantastic opportunity for the county. But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since . He is a former chairman of the Queenrsquos University GAA club and the Higher Education GAA Council, and has served on Ulster Council Management Committee and Central Council.Further details on the proposed new Centre of Excellence at Ballykinlar were outlined at Wednesdayrsquos meeting.Planning permission for the development was submitted earlier last week and the early concept designs of the complex were presented to club delegates. The site at the Ministry of Defence base will encompass four pitches, a MUGA and an administration and exhibition museum centre. Down GAA will now plan to appoint a Project Board in the New Year.Maureen OrsquoHigginswas elected as the new vice-chairperson of the board, on an evening when a number of officerships changed hands.Outgoing chairman Sean Rooney was selected to represent the county on the Ulster Council alongside Sean McCashin. Donal McNallywill assume the position of Irish and Cultural Officer, while Drumgathrsquos Michael McArdle is the new delegate to Central Council.As a result of disciplined financial management in recent years, the presentation of the financial report by treasurer Diarmuid Cahill showed a strong position for the county moving forward.Fourteen motions on the convention agenda were all approved, including ten proposals to go forward to the GAA Congress in Dublin at the end of February.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you. Itrsquos best done before the night is out.ldquoAlso, I say that having a bit of good manners helps, to say thank you and to appreciate what we do for each other..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Downpatrick man.jpg","title":"Downpatrick man in roll of honour  ","story":"FORMER Downpatrick and Ireland cricket captain Alfie Linehan was included in a prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who died during .He was among  from around the world listed as lsquospecial peoplersquo in BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme broadcast at the weekend.They included England goalkeeper Gordon Banks and racing driver Niki Lauda as well as another cricketer mdash one of Englandrsquos greatest fast bowlers, Bob Willis.Alfie died in June after suffering dementia and contracting cancer.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

If the pool is completed soon it would probably lie idle because pool staff have not yet been appointed.The situation has left councillors with red faces for the second time in several months.

They were due to meet the architects this week, but instead were sent a written report on the progress being made.The council clerk, Mr Seamus Byrne, read the report at a council meeting on Monday and said he expected a completion date early in the new year. In the report the architects catalogued a series of setbacks over the past two years and blamed most of the delay on strikes and shortages of materials.Downpatrick councillor, Mr Sean Quinn, launched into a scathing attack on the architects, who, he said, had failed to serve the council as they as they should.Mr Quinn said he found it disturbing that the architects must have known of the troubles on the site, yet had still made ldquowild predictions about the proposed opening date.Mr Quinn also condemned the mounting costs of work on the scheme and then drew attention to the pool itself, saying he felt the interior design was lacking in imagination.Mr Cecil Maxwell reminded councillors that they had approved the pool design and he did not think the architects were at fault for the slow progress.DROMARA mdash ADromara schoolgirl flies out to London tomorrow to represent Northern Ireland in a major essay competition.

We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

If and when an Assembly election happens, we will certainly be putting a lot of effort into securing a seat in South Down.Mr Brown said he went into the election with the intention of building on the partyrsquos best ever performance in a Westminster poll two years ago when it secured , votes.ldquoWe wanted this election to be our best ever result and we have done that, he declared.ldquoI would say that we knocked more doors in  than in this election as I was responsible for the partyrsquos social media and digital marketing campaign. As a result, my time was split between South Down and helping out in other areas including North Down and East Belfast.ldquoI know that working full time on an election campaign in South Down we can achieve an even better result. I also know that a lot of our voters did vote tactically and respect their decision to do so.

But this led to bogus claims about the agreement having depended on EU membership or having guaranteed an open border. It did no such thing. There is a much more plausible case to be made that it was a breach of the spirit of the deal, which was agreed at a time when no-one envisaged either party leaving the EU, but that is a dferent argument..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Dermot Nesbitt, on the opposite page , accuses the British and Irish governments of having failed to hold Sinn Fein to account for its failure to recognise the legitimacy of Northern Ireland, which was at the core of the agreement and the consent principle.Mr Nesbitt’s comments are all the more signicant given that he was on the moderate wing of unionism, and he helped the Ulster Unionist Party during their negotiations towards it.As Mr Nesbitt says, the failure of the two governments is all the greater given that they singled out the DUP forcriticism recently, something they have never shown any inclination of doing to Sinn Fein, which collapsed power-sharing.The temptation to accede to all Sinn Fein’s demands and restore Stormont on that basis is, naturally, great, for all other parties, yet it will only be a short-term fixso.If the party not only fails to recognise Northern Ireland in its rhetoric, but follows a de-stabilising course of politics in apparent pursuit of that refusal, then at the very least there is a duty on the UK government to call it out.We know that the Irish government simply will not do this. In fact, Dublin ultimately seems to share or adopt SF demands.But for London to stay mute is a grave dereliction of its responsibilities.• Demot Nesbitt: Shame on the two governments©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

politicians grappled with the growth of the internet, senior government ministers were alarmed by the professionalism of Sinn F#in#s website.Among filed declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast is a confidential minute of an April ,  meeting of the Security Information Group of senior civil servants and military commanders involved in counter-terrorism.The minute said that information on the security force deployment in Northern Ireland had been found on “the Sinn Féin site on the internet” and that in response the Home Office had asked the department to “explore the possibility of using the internet to get the NIO message across”.It went on: “The meeting noted that Sinn Féin was using the internet to good advantage. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog

example, could be read on the internet before it was on sale at retail outlets.”Referring to the suggestions of using the internet to push “good news stories” from the NIO and “ministerial soundbites”, Brigadier Strudley said that “dedicated resources might be required and possibly the formation of a committee to take the work forward”.Prior to the meeting, Home Office minister David Maclean had written a letter to fellow ministers Sir Nicholas Soames and Sir John Wheeler to say that he had come across the Sinn Féin material “freely available on the internet”.He said that he had done so while recently visiting a police computer crime squad where “amongst the unsavoury nasties on the internet were these very professionally produced pages apparently showing our complete deployment in Northern Ireland”.He added that “it horries me to find such dangerous and nasty propaganda on the internet.“When we add the other crimes and child pornography the police have to deal with, then the time for some sort of control is fast approaching.”In response, Sir John said: “I find it horric that such propaganda is available on the internet, particularly, detailed maps of all British forces in the ious towns as well as helicopter bases.“I very much support your view that, as the internet has  million American users and  million British users, we should use it effectively to get our own message across.”Declassied Files: Protestants starting to thank God for paramilitaries, Paisley told NIO Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

Mr Chilcot asked that the minute “be treated with particular care at this sensitive time”.By , Mr McNamara had been shadow Northern Ireland secretary for five years – an unusually long period in such a role. He was famously a fervent Irish nationalist, but opposed to the IRA’s campaign of violence.Sir John ChilcotDuring a meeting which went on late into the evening Mr McNamara outlined a philosophy whereby the principle of consent would not openly be removed, yet preparations for Irish unity would be made without the consent of Northern Ireland’s inhabitants.According to Mr Chilcot’s minute, Mr McNamara “said the essence of the position of an incoming Labour government would be to honour fully and wholeheartedly their commitment to see the three-stranded talks process go forward but that he personally doubted whether it had much prospect of success and thatit failed then the main policy thrust would turn towards North South harmonisation with the implicationthat the unionists would need to be cooperative in the talks processthey were to avoid the thrust of policy turning in the direction of ‘towards a united Ireland’. “Naturally the consent principle would hold but preparatory policies to encourage eventual unication need not and would not be impeded by the absence of that consent in the short to medium term.”Mr Chilcot said he “thought Mr McNamara was uncomfortable with my direct reference to and quotation from Mr Kinnock’s press conference at the Irish Embassy and that while his head, and party solidarity and loyalty, lead to the position he enunciated very clearly in the House of Commons on  March, his heart tugs him back to ‘towards a united Ireland’ and to the adoption and implementation of policies which the government would initiate and lead in both the economic and social spheres without the frustration and uncertainty which he clearly associates with the political development process”.Mr Chilcot said that in expressing pessimism about the likelihood of the talks succeeding and in envisaging a situation where moves were made towards harmonising policies across the border, Mr McNamara “echoed what both Mr Haughey and Mr Reynolds had indicated privately”.However, Mr McNamara was said to have “confirmed the very hard line on dealings with Sinn Féin and the Provisionals which he and Mr Kinnock have enunciated”.He said that he would want to see an end to the broadcasting ban on Sinn Féin and the transfer to Northern Ireland prisons of republican prisoners in Great Britain.Declassied Files: Alarm in  at Sinn Féin’s use of the internet Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"When Mr Chilcot asked him whether he would see those gestures being linked to movement by the IRA, Mr Chilcot said: “I think the thought was new and perhaps a dficult one for him”.The Labour frontbencher said he would espouse “total and complete rejection of any moves – eg. in terms of the legislative process, or the setting up of a Select Committee for Northern Ireland Affairs – which had any tinge of integrationism.“It was fundamental to his position to strengthen and harmonise all-Ireland matters, while resisting the blurring of Northern Ireland’s separate identity of that of either party of Great Britain.”On security, Mr Chilcot said that he found Mr McNamara “very ready to accept the points suggested in the briefing”. Mr McNamara said “he had not wanted and still did not want in advance of taking office to be given inside information or any detailed assessment of the situation or on any particular issue. There was always the dficulty of remembering what was to be kept secret and what [not] and he emphasised to me his concern to keep secrets secret.”Although Mr McNamara was one of the most devout Catholic MPs, he told Mr Chilcot that he “would wish so far as practicable to advance the course of integrated education while recognising the hostility of the Catholic Church to it” and suggested Catholic schools would “have to choose between % state funding, or the retention of something like the existing degree of control by the hierarchy”.In the end, Labour lost the  election and when Tony Blair became Labour leader in  he replaced Mr McNamara with Mo Mowlam.try catch  TrendingGame of Thrones NI actor Andrew Dunbar dies suddenlyThe full list of the  Northern Ireland New Yearrsquos

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There was a fire at the reception area near the compoundrsquos car park but it was unclear what had caused it. A man on a loudspeaker urged the mob not to enter the compound, saying: ldquoThe message was delivered.Donald Trump blamed Iran for the embassy breach and called on Iraq to protect the diplomatic mission.The US president tweeted: ldquoIran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. ldquoIn addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notied!  -- vw,vw,px, px\"Protesters smash a window inside the compound  --There were no reports of casualties, but the unprecedented breach was one of the worst attacks on the embassy in recent memory. It followed US air strikes on Sunday that killed  fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The US military said the air strikes were in retaliation for last weekrsquos killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that it blamed on the militia.The developments represent a major downturn in Iraq-US relations that could further undermine American influence in the region and weaken Washingtonrsquos hand in its campaign against Iran.Iraq has long struggled to balance its ties with the US and Iran, both allies of the Iraqi government, but the governmentrsquos angry reaction to the US air strikes and its apparent decision not to prevent the protesters from reaching the embassy signalled a sharp deterioration of relations. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Protesters damage property inside the compound  --Iraqi security forces made no effort to stop the protesters as they marched to the heavily fortied Green Zone after a funeral held for those killed in the US strikes, letting them pass through a security checkpoint leading to the area.The mob of marchers, many of them in militia unorms, shouted ldquoDown, Down USA! and ldquoDeath to America and ldquoDeath to Israel outside the compound, hurling water and stones over its walls. The mob set fire to three trailers used by security guards along the wall. Others then smashed the gates used by cars to enter and dozens pushed into the compound. The protesters stopped in a corridor after about  metres and were only about  metres away from the main building. Half a dozen US soldiers were seen on the roof of the main building, their guns pointed at the protesters, and smoke from the tear gas rose in the area.The protesters raised yellow militia flags and taunted the embassyrsquos security staff who remained behind the windows in the gatesrsquo reception area. They hung a poster on the wall declaring, ldquoAmerica is an aggressor and sprayed graffiti on the wall and windows. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The compound is inside the fortied Green Zone  --An Iraqi employee at the embassy told the AP that the embassyrsquos security team had evacuated some local staff from a rear gate while others left by helicopter as the rest remained inside ldquosafe areas within the embassy. Some commanders of militia factions loyal to Iran joined the protesters. Among them was Hadi al-Amiri, the head of the state-sanctioned paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Units, the umbrella group for the Iran-backed militias.At least three protesters appeared to have dficulties breathing from tear gas. No one was immediately reported hurt in the rampage, and security staff had withdrawn to inside the embassy earlier, soon after protesters gathered outside. The US air strikes mdash the largest targeting an Iraqi state-sanctioned militia in recent years mdash and the subsequent calls by the militia for retaliation, represent a new escalation in the proxy war between the US and Iran playing out in the Middle East.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sundayrsquos strikes sent the message that Washington will not tolerate actions by Iran that jeopardise American lives..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Iraqi militamen storm into US Embassy compound in Baghdad article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a - success on Saturday over PSNI at Shamrock Park.A Lee Bonis brace alongside goals from Chris Lavery, Adam Salley and Callum Ferris secured victory.“We were - up at half-time but had kept moving the ball around and the final goal was the most pleasing in terms of representing so much of what we work towards,” said Tipton. “It came after a -pass team move - by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"NI pizza restaurant to create  new jobsBreak-in at Spar store condemnedNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsTraffic and TravelTraffic update -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
