Those aged 19 or over will be paid the national minimum wage after that.Apprentices should receive 20 per cent of their training \u0027off the job\u0027, which also discourages firms from recruiting them as a cheaper option to full-time staff.The Government says 91 per cent of apprentices stay in work or go on to further training.But Ofsted inspection results for the nine months up to June 2020 show 42 per cent of apprenticeship providers in England were rated as either inadequate or requiring improvement.The Government says two-thirds of apprentices go to providers rated as good or outstanding and says the disparity is due to the fact that there are a large number of new providers, which don\u0027t necessarily have a large intake.It adds that it has introduced a register for apprenticeship providers to regulate quality.Despite the incentives, many employers are making apprentices redundant due to the pandemic, according to Darryn Lewis, of Find Apprenticeships.But he adds: \u0027Many training providers have adapted to offer remote training to be able to support the majority of learners and keep their courses running.\u0027The Advanced Learner Loan scheme can cover childcare or travel costs. The National Apprenticeship Services hosts networking events, while the website apprenticeshipguide.co.uk provides case studies and insight into both current and upcoming schemes.A full list of Ofsted-approved apprenticeships can be found at download.apprenticeships.education.gov.ukroatp.

Those filming the incident from high buildings 2 km (one mile) from the port were thrown backwards by the shock.It was not immediately clear what caused the initial blaze on Tuesday that set off the blast.Lebanon\u0027s health minister said more than 50 people had been killed and more than 2,750 injured. Lebanon\u0027s Red Cross said hundreds of people had been taken to hospitals.The governor of Beirut port told Sky News a team of firefighters, who were battling the initial blaze, had \u0027disappeared\u0027 after the explosion.       President Michel Aoun called for an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday and said a two-week state of emergency should be declared. He said it was \u0027unacceptable\u0027 that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were stored for six years without safety measures.The prime minister called for a day of mourning. The explosion occurred three days before a U.N.-backed court is due to deliver a verdict in the trial of four suspects from the Shi\u0027ite Muslim group Hezbollah over a 2005 bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and 21 others.Hariri was killed by a huge truck bomb on the same waterfront, about 2 km (about one mile) from the port. Western countries including the United States, Britain and France also said they were ready to assist.Images showed port buildings reduced to tangled masonry, devastating the main entry point to a country that relies on food imports to feed its population of more than 6 million.It threatens a new humanitarian crisis in a nation that hosts hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and which is already grappling with economic meltdown under one of the world\u0027s biggest debt burdens.Residents said glass was broken in neighbourhoods on Beirut\u0027s Mediterranean coast and inland suburbs several kms (miles) away. In Cyprus, a Mediterranean island 110 miles (180 km) across the sea from Beirut, residents heard the blast. One resident in Nicosia said his house and window shutters shook.

Tight restrictions on where we’ve been able to go and what we’ve been able to do have boosted the sales of fitness equipment as we’ve looked for ways to stay in shape, while staying safe.For many, this unprecedented situation has strained both our physical and mental wellbeing, but with lockdown measures easing and warmer weeks ahead, now is the time to renew good intentions and get more physically active.“Lockdown has knocked our health balance,” says Claire Davis, a fitness coach at wellness retreat 38 Degrees North. “We’ve eaten and drunk too much, exercised less than normal and succumbed to bad habits, increasing our stress levels. But summer is the ideal time to make healthy changes.”So whether your aim is to lose the odd lockdown pound, feel fitter or just stay strong enough to weather life’s next big storm, this is the perfect time to make the changes you’ve been daydreaming about.1. Borrow a dogSpoiler alert: walking is perhaps the best exercise there is as it’s low impact, can be done anywhere and almost anyone of any fitness level can get involved, for free.Just 15 minutes of moderate walking can see you cover about a mile’s worth of ground, so it’s easily one of the best ways to get out and get moving. Getting kids excited about going for a walk can be challenging, so why not lure them with the temptation of a furry friend for company? Borrow a neighbour’s dog to take to the local park or check out dog-lending websites such as borrowmydoggy to find a pooch in your area that may need its legs stretching.2. Pick local produceBecause of lockdown, the pick-your-own season has had a bit of a slow start, but many farms have now applied social distancing measures and reopened for business. A morning or afternoon picking your own fruit and veg is not only wholesome family fun (whisper it: exercise), but it also supports local businesses, and ticks the environmentally friendly box as it means fresh groceries without all of the unnecessary shrink-wrap. A quick Google should help locate your local farms (or try pickyourownfarms.org.uk) and remember to call to check opening times and crop availability ahead of your visit.3. Go for a dipSummer is the perfect time for outdoor swimming, whether that’s at your local lido (call and check that they’ve reopened) or somewhere a little more wild. There’s something extremely invigorating about braving the elements and swimming outdoors, and the UK is studded with rivers, lakes, ponds and beaches that are clean and safe to swim in.Wild swimming is loaded with health benefits, from lowering stress hormones to improving circulation and reducing inflammation, plus a 30-minute session in cold water can burn almost 400 calories. Visit wildswimming for locations close to you.4. Raise your voicePeople underestimate the fitness potential of a good old sing-song, but belting out a few tunes can burn calories, strengthen the diaphragm and pump more oxygen around the body than many other forms of aerobic exercise. It’s also brilliant for mental health – reducing stress, boosting self-confidence and releasing endorphins.Most local choirs remain on hold due to Covid-19 but many are holding virtual sing-alongs (check out singforfun).5. Hit the dance floorIt might be a while before nightclubs reopen, but dancing is a brilliant form of exercise and can be done right this second. Not only is dance a brilliant all-over aerobic workout, there is also a unique sense of freedom and empowerment that comes from moving your body to music, perfect for pepping yourself up post-lockdown.Dance instructor Illana Gambrill was so overwhelmed by people desperate to get back to Dancebox – her Essex-based classes – that she’s created a weekly online programme that is easy to sign up to, simple to follow and a bona fide saviour for mind, body and soul.6. Eat alfrescoWeather permitting, there is nothing more satisfying than sharing a meal with friends and family outdoors – the feelgood factor itself does much to boost our wellbeing. It is also thought to be of great benefit to children as outdoor eating – such as picnics and barbecues – often goes hand-in-hand with playdates and family bonding time. Fire up the coals or get a disposable barbecue to grill fish or lean cuts of meat such as chicken breasts or pork fillets, which are a healthier substitute for fatty burgers and sausages.Experiment with different marinades and simple side salads, invite some friends and don’t forget your brolly for the quintessential British experience. Fingers crossed you won’t need it.7. Learn to hulaHula hooping might conjure up visions of 1980s lycra-clad fitness types, or seem more like vintage child’s play, but it can actually burn as much fat as treadmill exercises, and other benefits include toning muscles and strengthening your heart.Advocates reckon that 10 minutes of hula-ing a day will see results and the plastic hoop should only set you back a couple of quid from a general store (although if you’re feeling fancy, a weighted one can be purchased for less than the cost of your average round at the pub). With minimal kit required and plenty of tutorials available online, this is an amazing way to start getting active again after the long lockdown break.8. Go geocachingImagine that you could be a part of the world’s biggest treasure hunt the moment you step out your door. Geocaching is exactly that. This free outdoor activity is suitable for all ages and uses the GPS on your smartphone to allow you to hide and seek secret containers at specific locations, marked by coordinates all over the world.Getting you out and about, turning you into real-life Lara Crofts – this is a brilliantly fun activity for the whole family. And with more than 3m caches to find, there’s bound to be something to sniff out near you. Register for a free basic membership at geocaching.9. Get out in the gardenThere is increasing evidence that gardening provides substantial health benefits – just interacting with flora lowers our cortisol, improving mood and mental health. You can also burn about 330 calories doing one hour of light gardening, plus when you’re outdoors your body makes vitamin D, which strengthens bones, although you should still apply sunscreen.If you don’t have a garden, search online for a local community gardening initiative failing that, plant some salad leaves in indoor pots. Growing your own food helps children develop a lasting habit of eating fresh vegetables and might make them more likely to try new (green) things.10. Walk and workFor many, lockdown has forced us to re-evaluate the way we work, revealing our astounding ability to multitask. So post lockdown, consider the ways in which you could make your regular working day that bit more active.Need to schedule a 30-minute meeting? Do what Steve Jobs was fond of and have a walking meeting instead. Or if somebody wants to meet up to talk business over coffee, suggest making it a takeaway and having a stroll. You can also extend these multitasking habits outside of work hours with a spot of “temptation bundling” – pairing something you love with an activity you’re trying to do more of. Make sitting in a squat while binge-watching box-sets the new normal.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Today is the day we say we’re putting Queenslanders first.The state health minister, Steven Miles, said the road border from NSW would be subject to a “hard closure” and that only a few vehicles – including freight and residents of northern NSW border communities – would be allowed to cross.Some exemptions would be allowed, but these would be “rare”.The road border to the Northern Territory would remain open, but photo ID would be required as part of the process of obtaining a border pass.“This is a hard closure,” Miles said. “This is all about keeping Queenslanders safe and catching anyone who tries to lie to get into our state.”The new border closure – the strictest measures yet – was announced on Thursday, after Labor had spent days running election advertising criticising the Liberal National party opposition for its earlier calls to allow more freedom of movement.The issue will likely dominate the campaign ahead of the election in late October.Opinion polls show overwhelming support for Palaszczuk’s handling of the coronavirus situation, but the LNP marginally ahead of Labor in two-party-preferred terms.As Labor doubled down by heightening its restrictions and attacking the LNP, the LNP leader Deborah Frecklington released a statement saying she supported the latest move.“Queenslanders must be kept safe to protect lives and livelihoods,” she said.“The LNP has always said the border controls are not set and forget. As the situation in other states changes so should our response in Queensland.‘“In recent weeks it has become clear that the Palaszczuk Labor government’s honour system at the border was not working. The gaps in enforcement have put Queenslanders’ lives and livelihoods at risk.“The LNP supports stronger action on borders because we can’t risk a second wave.”Queensland detected one new coronavirus case yesterday, a 48-year-old woman from the West Moreton area. The source of the infection is under investigation.Palaszczuk said the decision to close the borders to NSW and the ACT was made after a meeting of the state disaster management group early on Wednesday morning.She said the decision was partly based on a desire to avoid the economic costs of a second lockdown, similar to the situation in Melbourne.“It’s a very concerning situation that we are seeing – the lockdown happening in Victoria, and the huge impact that that is having on the economy,” Palaszczuk said.“And our hearts go out to Victoria. We know they’ll get through this together, and we will continue to monitor what’s happening down there.“I know it’s going to be tough on Queenslanders, but your health comes first.“We need to protect not only our health, we need to protect the families, we need to protect our economy. We’ve seen what’s happened in Victoria. We don’t want to see that happening here.“Businesses have said to me, loudly and clearly, that they do not want to go backwards. They want to stay where they are. And we need Queenslanders supporting Queenslanders.“It’s also very important that Queenslanders stay in Queensland. Now is not the time to travel to NSW. Now is not the time to travel to Victoria. I will not risk the safety of Queenslanders and I will not risk our economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bed6c123bef1da75dba6006e84565daa8a5b9a15/0_79_5165_3100/master/5165.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=aeeaf72c235f83f66a1512c66cd6a26e","title":"dixons carphone to get rid of 800 managers across uk stores","story":"Dixons said it was axing jobs to create a “leaner” management structure in its storesDixons Carphone is getting rid of 800 managers in its stores as it continues to cut costs despite benefiting from a surge in demand for laptops, monitors, and games consoles during the lockdown.The retailer is the latest big high street name to announce job losses as the economic upheaval created by the coronavirus pandemic takes it toll.

At the same time, companies still need to have offices that staff can drop in for social interaction, meetings and business reviews. “You don’t want to meet people in your front room or bedroom.”IWG has office space in more than 1,100 towns and cities, while its struggling rival, the office space startup WeWork, has focused on big capital cities such as New York and London.The current quarter will be tough, but the firm expects things to improve in the fourth quarter.“This global crisis has dramatically changed the ways companies will work. In the new world of working post Covid-19, offices will still be needed but there will be a greater requirement for more flexible space,” Dixon said. “Some of the big banks are thinking about it, Facebook – it’s pretty universal.”More companies will have workforces spread out with more satellite offices, more employees working closer to home or continuing to work from home, he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34842b6f900ba7fc82584fd1eba2376704babae1/0_0_5701_3420/master/5701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c3073778871180c89c9f2eeae8b08d8","title":"the guardian view on empty offices goodbye to all that","story":"The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating a digitally driven trend that was already in train. We need to plan for the downsidesIn The Good Life, a much-loved 1970s sitcom, one of the main characters would regularly arrive home from work cursing the trials and tribulations of the daily commute. Jerry Leadbetter was an affluent senior manager in a design firm based in central London. By contrast, his stress-free next-door neighbours in Surbiton, Tom and Barbara Good, had opted for a green, self-sufficient lifestyle. They would have been at home all day, working to their own timetable.Along with The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, the BBC comedy was among the first attempts in popular culture to explore alternative lifestyles and question the merits of a nine-to-five office-based existence. Made almost half a century ago, its theme seems strangely contemporary. Right now, Jerry’s modern equivalent will almost certainly be working from home. And the signs are that they will not be going back to the office in the city any time soon.But it also seems clear that, in certain types of work, the lockdown is accelerating a transition that was already in train as a result of the Zoom-style possibilities afforded by digital technology. The glass palaces of corporate capitalism have suddenly lost a little bit of their aura. The chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, has suggested that piling 7,000 employees into a tall building “may be a thing of the past”. Large numbers of businesses have reported that productivity has been maintained, or even enhanced, as people work from home. Firms’ accountants will have taken note.The environmental upside to decongesting our cities and travelling less is clear. And for many people, working from home has brought a welcome degree of personal freedom. But if change is coming, it would be foolish not to think through and plan for a profound societal shift with some potentially damaging consequences. The high-end service economy, which has driven the prosperity of western cities in the post-industrial era, has also kept thousands of restaurants, cafes, dry cleaners and taxi drivers in business. Recent data from the Resolution Foundation indicated that only one in 10 lower earners, many of them women, are able to work from home. A sudden unravelling of urban life will further limit their possibilities.The normalisation of remote working will also have an impact on younger workers who, though digitally native, are also more likely to live in cramped circumstances and miss the kind of formative experiences that happen in a physical workplace. A recent American study found that far more 18- to 24-year-olds felt they were less rather than more productive at home. More broadly, the workplace can function as a valuable place of bonding and creativity, as well as a mixed social space that does people the service of removing them from their online social media bubbles.There is a danger that the Covid-19 experiment in working from home will trigger a paradigm shift that will mostly benefit the bottom line of businesses and their senior employees. The consequences of the ongoing digital revolution in work need to be better managed than that. A good life for the modern Jerry Leadbetter should not be at the expense of those without his options."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f418e6403849e53b4a5ee573a511a4e0000da320/19_0_3461_2078/master/3461.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8a0b60e8bde412360b6e41b026929456","title":"one thing ive learned about modern farming we shouldnt do it like this","story":"A journalist who has spent decades investigating ‘big ag’ explains why the drive for cheaper food has come at too high a priceAs we walked quietly through the trees, the water ahead looked like a manmade fishing lake, or maybe a small reservoir. We were in a strip of forest, along a single-track road, making our way towards a huge industrial farm. It was overcast and the high trees made the day even more gloomy.We had been hired to investigate conditions on farms supplying UK supermarkets for a TV programme and not-for-profit campaign, and that was how we found ourselves at this giant pig farm in Poland. The arrival of foreign meat companies in the country was proving controversial. Local people were worried about the environmental consequences – as well as impacts on smaller-scale farmers – of having a multinational meat firm pitch up on their doorstep. We had arrived the day before, sleeping very little before driving for hours into the countryside. I was twitchy, a little nervous, head aching from a night on a lumpy, unfamiliar mattress. We knew the farm was around here somewhere, but weren’t sure which direction to take. And then ahead of us, through the trees, we spotted the lake. At the same time the smell reached us: an appalling stench, one of the worst smells I have ever encountered in my life.This was no lake. It was an open cesspit, a vast lagoon full of waste from the pig farm. Floating beneath the surface were the bodies of pigs in various stages of decomposition. Through the filth we could see snouts and curly tails.Everywhere was the detritus of factory farming – plastic syringe casings, needles and white clinical gloves – floating in the rancid pool and discarded on adjacent farmland. It was the first time I’d ever stepped on to a factory farm. It was a moment I would never be able to forget.I grew up mainly in towns and cities. My experience of farming was limited to those compulsory-but-dull school or Scouts visits to the local dairy, or the livestock you might come across during family days out in the countryside.In the early 1990s, I remember seeing television reports about the BSE scandal and hearing talk about the perils of eating beef. But I was a teenager. I had more important things to worry about. But in 2001, the foot and mouth disaster unfolded across the UK, with its burning cattle pyres and “no entry” signs erected across the countryside. This time I paid attention. The whole episode – devastated farmers, a rural economy in tatters, millions of farm animals culled, political wrangling and endless debates about who or what was to blame – highlighted somehow that something had gone wrong with the way we were farming and producing food.I went into journalism, working freelance for magazines and newspapers. In late 2003 I co-founded a media outfit – part production company, part detective agency – to carry out investigations into environmental and human rights issues, as well as animal welfare. We wanted to use the tactics of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), who’d pioneered using dummy companies, hidden cameras and undercover agents to expose the ivory trade and illegal logging, to work as journalists and also for not-for-profit groups. Business was brisk. Demand for our work was high, and in 2005 we were commissioned to go to Poland.Although we were increasingly aware of the way our food was being produced thanks to the work of journalists such as Felicity Lawrence and Joanna Blythman, for me, as for most people, modern farming remained remote abstraction.But now, here in Poland, I was seeing the reality. In one vast, windowless warehouse, hundreds of young pigs were visible under the artificial lights: moving, squealing, eating, shitting. The unmistakable waft of animal waste and chemicals. Lame and injured pigs – one had an abnormal growth the size of a grapefruit, some looked emaciated, others appeared sick – and dead animals left abandoned on the ground, live pigs rustling around the carcasses. On the wall, charts recording the animals that had died – so-called mortality records – and medication sheets detailing the antibiotics that could be used.Afterwards, the smell stayed with us – on our clothes, our skin, our hair – seemingly for days.Why was our food being produced like this? It was shocking and I wanted to know more.I have now spent the best part of a decade and a half reporting on almost every aspect of the global meat industry. It is a journey that has taken me to farms of all types and sizes, from family smallholdings to vast concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and into abattoirs, livestock markets, ports and food factories in numerous countries.There is a widespread culture of secrecy and a lack of accountability in the global meat industry, which is dominated by a handful of powerful yet little known corporations. Shining a light on “big ag’s” murkier corners therefore requires months of research, the sourcing of often suppressed data and documents, working with whistleblowers, and undercover investigations.In reality, quite often it’s about seizing the moment. Quickly pointing the camera through an open window or barn door or locked gate, or under a wire fence. You film what you find, first a scene-setting shot, to give a sense of scale and context, then close-ups to bring details to life.Sometimes, if you are following up a tipoff about a particularly problematic farm, what you see might be distressing – a pile of dead and dying chickens a spent dairy cow, sprawled out on the floor taking its last gasps an injured sheep, still alive, maggots in its wounds – accompanied by a backdrop of ear-deafening squeals or incessant grunts from confined livestock or the nauseating smell of waste as you try to focus.It always feels like you’ve stayed too long, even if it has only been seconds. You worry you haven’t got enough pictures – farms are inevitably dark and not conducive to cinematic beauty – and you pray the camera has done its job.Often, there’s simply too much happening to know where to point the camera, such as when a shedload of chickens are being rounded up for slaughter, workers swarming around you in near-darkness.Some of the farmers I’ve visited over the years are happy to have us they’ve nothing to hide and welcome the opportunity to talk about the challenges of making ends meet. Sometimes – particularly in the case of large corporate-owned farms or slaughterhouses – open filming isn’t an option. You have to rely on undercover reporting and hidden cameras.In the old days you could do it and worry about the details later, as long as you used common sense, adhered to biosecurity and basic health and safety rules. Now, any covert reporting has to be cleared in advance by editors and lawyers and requires lots of form filling, to make sure there’s public interest and justification. That’s as it should be, but it certainly makes things more complicated.As a journalist, it’s my job to go and see for myself the worst conditions that I hear about. In Italy, on farms supplying “artisanal” parma ham, I saw pigs held in battery conditions, with animals confined in metal cages – gestation crates, or sow stalls – designed for those that have been recently inseminated. They had no room to turn around: the cages weren’t much wider than the pigs themselves.In Portugal, I saw pigs being repeatedly hit and dragged by the ears, squealing, on to transporters before starting their journey to slaughter. In Spain, thousands of quails – reared for their eggs – were crammed into filthy battery cages, many having lost feathers and others dead and left to rot. Calves, too – some subject to journeys on trucks that take days – confined in solitary pens as part of the veal trade.In Bulgaria, I visited primitive horse and donkey farms, including one where animals were fixed to the wall or floor with rope and chains. Some had little, if any, straw or other bedding. At one farm, the corpse of a horse lay sprawled outside, blood visible on the ground. Similarly, in Croatia, I saw cattle tethered day and night in darkened sheds, some never having set foot on grass.In Chile, I saw vast offshore “floating feedlots” with thousands of salmon packed into underwater cages. In the UK – at one of the country’s biggest intensive beef farms – we saw cows caked in excrement and other waste in flooded, dirty yards with no protection from the elements.And in poultry units across Europe, time and again I’ve seen broiler chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese crammed into vast, crowded sheds with no outside access. Each morning on these farms, workers remove the birds that have died overnight. Sometimes a handful, sometimes scores of birds, flung into piles on the floor or loaded on to wheelbarrows, and chicks disposed of – some still alive – into skips piled high with carcasses.These scenes illustrate the virtual worthlessness of inidual birds. On some farms, hundreds of birds can die each week – in the UK, more than a million chickens die before reaching the slaughterhouse each year.The chain doesn’t end on farms. Animals have to be processed into meat, and slaughterhouses have faced repeated allegations of cruelty, despite supposedly stringent oversight in many countries.I’ve been inside poultry and rabbit abattoirs. I worked undercover in Portugal, capturing footage at a slaughterhouse specialising in suckling pigs, usually roasted whole as a popular treat. The graphic scenes we filmed caused uproar in a country where few people had seen how their meat was being produced.After being unloaded, the pigs were taken to a stun room containing a series of small holding pens where a worker, using what looked like a large pair of tongs, stood among the squealing animals and calmly applied a shock to each one’s head before shackling the bodies on to the moving production line which carried them up through a hatch in the wall.Some twitched involuntarily after being attached to the moving rail, others appeared to be fully conscious as they moved along the line, eyes open and kicking, into the kill room. Here, a worker plunged a large knife into each pig’s neck, causing a gush of blood to shoot down into a tray below, and holding each pig by the legs as they began to “bleed out”.The slaughterman offered me the knife in case I wanted a go. I declined.Where cameras can’t go, you have to rely on other evidence. Unpublished reports by UK vets and hygiene inspectors that I obtained detailed thousands of – apparently industrywide – breaches of welfare regulations, including instances of chickens and pigs being boiled alive after being immersed into tanks of scalding hot water, used to soften the skin and remove hair or feathers.The smell and sounds and frenetic activity of an abattoir don’t leave you. The whirring of machinery, the clinking of chains, the animal cries, the shouts of workers, the steam, the blood and offal carcasses swinging on the line. The animals may be stressed, but you wonder also what impact this has on the workers who do this, day in, day out.The effects of these industrial systems are not just felt in the farmyards or the slaughterhouses. I have seen the wider impact of the quest for food miles away from the farms. Animals that once lived off the land, or off waste, are now given bags of expensive industrially produced feed the need to fatten them as quickly as possible demands huge inputs of protein, and that protein is pulled from all over the world.Soy is one source. I’ve reported on the well-known problems with deforestation but I’ve alsowritten about some of the chilling human rights abuses connected to the industry in Paraguay, where much soy was destined for factory farms in China and Europe. Peasant and indigenous organisations had been protesting against the encroachment of the soy farms on their land. The response from some of the soy farmers – with the backing of police and paramilitary units – was brutal: violent evictions, shootings and beatings, resulting in numerous injuries and several deaths, as well as arbitrary detentions and disappearances.Fishmeal is another source of protein with its own impact, as I saw in Peru. Yards away from the bustling port of Chimbote, lying on the rubbish-strewn beach, were the carcasses of about six sea lions, quietly rotting in the sunshine. Their normally grey silky skin had turned a rusty, orange hue. One carcass, its eyes long since gone and tongue spilling out from its swollen body, was swarming with flies.The sea lions had been slaughtered by local fishermen, who saw them as competitors for dwindling fish resources in this part of the Pacific. Demand for anchovy – hoovered up for use in fishmeal and fish oil – had impacted on the sea’s natural food chain, and reduced stocks of previously plentiful species fished for human consumption.Forty fishmeal factories were processing anchovies caught by the city’s fleet, and the area had become a major flashpoint for conflict. (New fishmeal frontiers in west Africa and Asia have joined the party, bringing fresh problems.)I visited one poor community where more than a dozen women and children gathered in the dusty, unpaved street to vent their anger at pollution from the fishmeal plants: they claimed they were responsible for asthma, bronchial and skin problems, particularly in children.Footage filmed by residents showed conditions when plants were operational: billowing black smoke drifted through the streets, obscuring vision and choking passersby. It looked like the aftermath of a bomb.According to environmentalists, the sea in Ferrol Bay off Chimbote was now becoming a “dead zone”, largely due to contamination from the fishmeal industry. The plants were accused of discharging protein, fat and oil into the bay, as well as contaminated marine water used during the process of pumping fish from the ship’s hull to the processing plant.I remember looking at the ocean stretching out in front of us, and feeling anger and bewilderment that it was being choked of life – quite literally – largely to feed livestock confined in far-off farms.So how did we end up with this system? Industry chiefs I’ve interviewed argue that factory farms exist because of the demand for cheap meat, and that producing enough of it efficiently to meet that demand is possible only by using intensive systems.They point out that supermarkets – arguably the biggest champions of cheap food – require reliable and consistent supplies that meet exact specifications, all year round. Sourcing on such a scale simply wouldn’t be viable if they bought only from the smaller, independent family-owned farms run in the traditional ways.And despite the furore around the spread of megafarms, size isn’t an indicator of the welfare standards they maintain in fact larger, more modern units are often superior, with hi-tech systems and good veterinary care.Despite what I’ve seen, experience tells me that the majority of livestock farmers are decent, hardworking folk who do their best to make a living in an industry where money doesn’t readily flow down to the small guys, and where margins are often so slim that any unforeseen event can prove catastrophic.I have spoken to dairy farmers who are trying desperately to keep their businesses afloat but acknowledge that, at some point, their farms will have to close, despite in some cases being in the same family for generations. I’ve spoken to beef farmers – some of whom quietly expressed criticism of the intensive feedlot-style cattle farms popping up across the UK – that have dedicated themselves to offering higher welfare, grass-fed beef sold directly to the public as an alternative to cheap supermarket products.Many of these farmers are as much victims of the system as their livestock.In the age of hyper-cheap food you can pick up a whole chicken for a few pounds, and a pint of milk for less than a bottle of water. Yet these prices fail to reflect the true cost of production. The terms dictated by supermarkets and processing companies put too many farmers in the grotesque position of losing money on the foodstuffs they’ve spent weeks, months or years producing.It’s the sheer scale of production, driven by insatiable demand, that is the problem, fuelling bigger farms and more intensive systems – the more animals you can squeeze in, the more food you can produce, the more money there is to be made.Megafarms that house thousands of pigs, poultry, beef and dairy cattle are now common. But when things go wrong – fires, floods, disease outbreaks, equipment breakdowns, pollution – the bigger the farm, the bigger the consequences.Coupled with vertically integrated supply chains and controversial contract farming models – which, critics say, outsource many of the financial risks to farmers – this has unavoidably created a system which has turned farm animals into mere commodities. “Meat machines”, as one campaigner put it.The language used in the poultry industry illustrates the point: industrially produced chickens are no longer referred to as birds but as “crops”, in the same way as you might refer to a field of lettuces or tomatoes. Chicken producers can be referred to as “growers”, not farmers, and it comes as no surprise that they are not paid for inidual birds, but for the weight each “crop” of chickens achieves.As one UK farmer told me, modern chicken sheds are simply “petri dishes of live protein-on-legs”.About 70 billion land animals are produced globally for food each year, an estimated two-thirds reared in intensive conditions. Many of the issues this raises, and which I’ve covered extensively – food safety, antibiotic resistance, animal welfare, exploitation of workers, pollution, deforestation – are now firmly on the global agenda and commanding attention.The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted renewed calls for change: in the US, some politicians are calling for the biggest factory farms to be phased out by 2040. Even the UN is urging a rethink of industrial farming, citing links with zoonotic infections and the widespread use of arable land for animal feed, driving deforestation.Addressing the question of how the world produces enough meat, safely and sustainably (and humanely), to feed a growing population while safeguarding the environment, is more relevant – and more complicated – than ever.I’ll leave it to scientists and others more qualified than me to answer this question. But, thinking back to that squalid farm in Poland, and everything I’ve seen since, I can safely say one thing: we shouldn’t do it like this.This is an edited extract from a longer version of this article, which can be found on Medium"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd8e00cddb20dd49658051a329b3a8b231575028/0_6_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d132417f3be6546f2167992f1c59057","title":"wildlife forensics how a giant pangolin named ghost could help save the species aoe","story":"A new research programme in Gabon is identifying the ‘isotopic fingerprint’ of the world’s most-trafficked mammal in the fight to beat smugglersAfter a two-week chase through Lopé-Okanda national park, a mosaic of rainforest and savannah in central Gabon, David Lehmann and his Wildlife Capture Unit were celebrating – they had caught a giant pangolin nicknamed Ghost, the biggest on record.The team – consisting of eco-guards, an indigenous tracker, a field biologist and a wildlife vet – hope that Ghost, who weighs 38kg and measures 1.72m from nose to tail, will give valuable insights in their fight against poaching. A nocturnal lifestyle and the fact that it feels most at home in a complex system of deep inaccessible burrows makes the giant ground pangolin – Smutsia gigantea – one of the least researched species in the animal kingdom.“We know little about their basic ecology, their movements and population sizes, and our lack of knowledge hinders our efforts to protect them,” says Lehmann, a wildlife ecologist. His research is part of the EU’s Ecofac6 programme, a commitment that started in the 1990s to safeguard bioersity in the Congo basin. “What we are doing here is pioneering work,” he says.The only scaly mammal in the world, a pangolin’s body is covered with razor-sharp, overlapping keratin plates. When attacked, it rolls into an armoured ball with scales raised: an effective defence against predators, but not against the snare traps of poachers. Pangolins are thought to be the world’s most trafficked mammals. With the four Asian species already hunted to near extinction, the African Wildlife Foundation estimates that around 2.7 million pangolins are trafficked from Africa’s rainforests each year.Popular for its meat, the pangolin has long been hunted for local consumption but Gabon’s minister for forests, oceans, environment and climates, Professor Lee White, argues that it is the demand in Asia that is of chief concern.Pangolin scales are a popular ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, used for anything from rheumatism, asthma and cancer to treating infertility in women and promoting lactation. There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the medicine, so wildlife groups welcomed an announcement in June that pangolin was being removed from the official 2020 listing of ingredients approved for use in traditional Chinese medicine. But any benefits from the move have yet to filter down.“Gabon is seeing the commercial poaching of pangolins,” says White. “The demand from China and the enormous profit margins are attracting organised crime.” International syndicates smuggling ivory, minerals, gold and diamonds at the border with Cameroon have expanded the scope of their business, he says. “For three years now we have been detecting ivory poachers with sacks of pangolin scale.”Lehmann wants to “provide governments with rapid and accurate tools for habitat conservation, and improve wildlife crime forensics in general”, and hopes his research will bolster efforts against poaching and trafficking.Knowledge about the size of the pangolins’ hunting grounds, their population density and seasonally preferred habitats could help the Gabonese National Park Agency to step up effective protective measures, such as more targeted patrols.Lehmann and his team take live samples from giant pangolins such as Ghost – something, according to Lehmann, that has never been done before. After capture and sedation, samples of blood, saliva, faeces, tissue and scales are taken from each animal and then a GPS transmitter is fastened to its tail. The entire procedure lasts about two hours and provides a unique set of data.In addition, a network of 24 to 40 camera traps has been set up in Lopé-Okanda national park to monitor the animals’ movements, nest ecology and habitat use. It is hoped that information from the camera traps combined with spatial data will provide an insight into the animal’s life expectancy, territoriality and motion range, and shed light on its reproductive behaviour. “We are opening the door to a new universe,” says Lehmann.The scale samples are used to extract their isotopic values, the unique composition of chemical elements such as oxygen, hydrogen or carbon that are stored in the animal’s keratin plates. An “isotopic fingerprint” allows for identification of a pangolin’s geographic home: each environmental zone has its own unique “isoscape”, which can be matched with that of an animal. This technology can be used to identify the origin of confiscated pangolin scales, helping to crack down on smuggling routes.The billion-dollar illegal trade in wild animals is now the world’s fourth largest criminal business, after arms, drugs and human trafficking. As the trade is highly mobile with new trade routes emerging every year, the wildlife conservation organisation Traffic recommends international collaboration between source, destination and transit countries in intelligence-led investigations. “We are basically fighting on our own at the moment. And we still haven’t been able to win this war,” says White, who has spearheaded Gabon’s fight against wildlife crimes and, in particular, ivory trafficking for the past three decades.He would like to see more engagement from his European counterparts in the fight to stop international pangolin trafficking. “Thus far, I don’t get the impression that the law enforcement community in most European countries thinks of wildlife crimes particularly seriously.”Traffic reports that most scales smuggled to China from Cameroon or Nigeria are routed through European airports.José Antonio Alfaro Moreno, a senior specialist for environmental crime at Europol, supports law enforcement agencies across Europe with anti-trafficking operations. “Wildlife crime is a new priority area in the European Union,” he says, adding that agencies are working with a variety of new methods, including using sniffer dogs to detect smuggled animals and animal parts.“You need to prove to the court that this is the actual species and no other,” he says, noting the importance of lab-based techniques to identify species. Whereas DNA analysis is common, stable isotope analysis is not yet implemented by most countries.State-of-the-art forensics technology – such as radiocarbon dating and X-ray fluorescence – is already being used to effectively trace illegal timber trading and to target illicit rhino horn and ivory syndicates.“Wildlife forensics is a rapidly developing area, and with good reason,” says Richard Thomas, Traffic’s Head of Communications. “The application of forensic techniques to wildlife crime can provide the same sort of insights as it does to solving regular criminal cases.”Behaviour change on the demand side is equally critical for the conservation of pangolins, says Thomas: “Wildlife crime is perceived as low risk-high benefit: it’s a mindset that needs to be changed. Meanwhile, it’s consumer demand that fuels the trade: change consumer behaviour and you change the whole trade.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936c0b105d58b82b2a988d0eba4748aafbe7bbbc/0_170_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12fa8ce003a759fdbd7f9b583913858b","title":"tesco urged to ditch meat company over alleged links to amazon deforestation","story":"Responding to Greenpeace campaign to cut links to Brazilian meat giant JBS, supermarket calls on government to ensure all UK food is deforestation-freeTesco has called on the UK government to order food companies to ensure all food sold in the UK is deforestation-free. The move comes in response to a new Greenpeace campaign calling on the supermarket to cut links to JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, over its alleged links to farms involved in Amazon deforestation.The supermarket says the UK should introduce due diligence across supply chains to monitor for deforestation. Germany is also weighing up a due diligence law on supply chains, reportedly supported by Angela Merkel. And more than half of Britons would consider rejecting meat products linked to deforestation, a YouGov poll for Greenpeace has found.“Today we call for our government to mandate food companies, as part of its National Food Strategy, to introduce effective due diligence across supply chains to make sure all food sold in the UK is deforestation-free,” said the Tesco group chief executive, Dave Lewis, in a statement. “We are making tangible progress but we can’t solve this on our own.”But Tesco said that while it has blocked Brazilian meat sales since 2018, it will not delist two JBS-owned meat suppliers. JBS said it was committed to ending deforestation throughout its supply chain.“Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon,” said Anna Jones, Greenpeace UK’s head of forests, describing the world’s biggest rainforest as “a big beating ecosystem that helps to regulate the climate and plays a role in climate stability.”JBS has been linked to farms involved in Amazon deforestation five times in just over a year. Investor Nordea Asset Management has dropped the company from its portfolio.In 2009, following a Greenpeace report exposing the role of Brazilian meat companies in Amazon deforestation, JBS and other Brazilian meat companies committed to controlling their “indirect suppliers” by 2011. Greenpeace said JBS is “still slaughtering the Amazon” in a new report also released on Wednesday. “JBS continues to have a problem,” said Jones. “It does not have full transparency.”“Setting fires to clear land for crops or grazing is destroying precious habitats like the Brazilian rainforest. It must stop. That’s why we support Greenpeace’s aim to prevent further Amazon deforestation,” a spokesperson for Tesco said.But delisting Moy Park and Tulip – which also supply Aldi, Co-op, Lidl, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose – “could lead to thousands of job losses, impact British farmers and ultimately compromise our ability to offer fresh British meat and chicken to our customers,” Tesco said. “We recognise that the UK as a whole needs to reduce meat and dairy consumption.”In Brazil, an expensive army operation to combat fires and deforestation has been widely criticised as ineffective by local media, and the government has been reluctant to admit it has a deforestation problem.“Brazil is one of the few countries in the world that is able to produce and preserve,” agriculture minister Tereza Cristina Dias said in a video speech to the Brazilian Agrobusiness Association on Monday. “We have improved our livestock farming, reducing the use of land and increasing productivity.”In response to Greenpeace’s claims that the company is indirectly sourcing cattle from farms in the Amazon involved in deforestation, a spokesperson said: “All JBS subsidiary companies adhere to strict responsible procurement policies throughout their supply chains and share our dedication to eliminating deforestation for good.”“We have been at the forefront of the industry in taking steps to improve supply chain traceability in Brazil. We are working closely with national and local government departments to develop solutions and system improvements around supply chain traceability and best agricultural practice to eradicate deforestation.“JBS will continue to evolve continuously in new initiatives and plans in the coming months to promote significant changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c82ae1bf918e26aa4661c303ed8909fb2269205/0_1311_2161_1296/master/2161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c76670cce683ea2fbbfcfdc58e9a5d4","title":"throng of new penguin colonies in antarctica spotted from space","story":"The discoveries were made by spotting the distinctive red-brown guano patches the birds leave on the ice. The finds were made possible by higher-resolution images from a new satellite, as previous scans were unable to pick up smaller colonies.Two of the colonies were a particular surprise. They were found far from the coast, living on sea ice that is anchored to grounded icebergs, a location never seen before.Emperor penguins are the only penguins that breed on sea ice, rather than land, making them especially vulnerable to the climate crisis. All the new colonies are in areas that are at risk and researchers say these will be the “canaries in the coal mine” as global heating increasingly affects Antarctica.Philip Trathan, also at BAS, said: “The new breeding sites are all in locations where recent model projections suggest emperor penguins will decline. These birds are therefore probably the canaries in the coalmine – we need to watch these sites carefully as climate change will affect this region.”Fretwell said one of the colonies was 112 miles (180km) from the Antarctic continent: “Many of the penguin scientists we have talked to were disbelieving, as normally you expect them to be at the coast.” Emperor penguins need stable sea ice, usually attached to land, for nine months of the year to breed successfully.There were only 30 colonies known a decade ago, as they are usually in remote and inaccessible locations, where temperatures can fall as low as -50C in winter. But then Landsat satellite images began to be used. These have a resolution of 30 metres, which is enough to spot the larger colonies.The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite was launched in June 2015 and has a resolution of 10 metres. This enabled a search for the smaller penguin colonies, as reported by the BAS scientists in the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation.Emperor penguins were expected to be present at fairly regular intervals around the coast of Antarctica, so the search was targeted in areas where none were known. “In every gap where we thought there might be a colony, we found one,” said Thretwell.Three of the 11 colonies found had been suspected following ship or aeroplane sightings of penguins in the 1960s and 1980s, but Sentinel-2 images confirmed their presence. There are now 61 known emperor colonies around Antarctica. “There may be one or two very small colonies yet to be discovered, but I think we have filled in all the gaps now,” said Thretwell.The next step is to direct satellites with very high, 30cm-resolution cameras over the colonies to enable the penguins to be counted. “It is dark at the moment in Antarctica, so we can’t count them yet,” said Thretwell. “The sun will come up either later this month or next month in most of these locations, and then we will start.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6161ae1309f30637390edfc527aa744e2b13b88/139_75_2584_1551/master/2584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1f0c899e75d0b695bc1f61fee432681","title":"so ellen degeneres is not as nice as we thought shes been saying that all along","story":"Staff on DeGeneres’s talkshow have denounced its ‘toxic’ environment. The host may not be to blame, but she has always been spikier than her public image What on earth is going on with Ellen DeGeneres?Kate, by emailThings are not well in Ellen land. Things have been worse, but let’s catch up on the current situation first.Last month, 11 current and former employees of her hugely popular talkshow, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, spoke out, alleging that there is a “toxic workplace environment” on her show, with one black employee saying that a writer made racist comments. Other employees said they were fired after taking bereavement days to attend the funerals of family members.More recently, Neil Breen, a former producer of the Australian breakfast show Today, has talked about DeGeneres’s “bizarre” behaviour when she was interviewed on the programme in 2013. Being, like, a proper journalist and everything, I called up Breen to ask him to explain. “Her people said to me: ‘Right, Neil, you stand here and when Ellen arrives you’re not to approach her, you’re not to talk to her, you’re not to look at her.’ And I said: ‘Are you fair dinkum?’” They were. “I was the producer of the show! I wasn’t there for a selfie, you know what I mean?” says Breen.The worm really began to turn for DeGeneres when she was photographed last October yukking it up with George W Bush at an American football game. Now, Bush is known to be a pretty personable guy. But palling around a US president who opposed gay marriage felt a bit off brand for a famously gay and famously married celebrity. DeGeneres said: “I’m friends with a lot of people who don’t share the same beliefs I have.”Let’s take a breath here. The workplace issues sound terrible. But the rest of it – the tone-deaf comments, the friendship with Bush – really only seem weird in the context of DeGeneres, whose whole brand is about niceness. Put it this way: if Jay Leno said something dickish and played golf with Bush, no one would care. This stuff does not fit into the DeGeneres narrative, which has been about teaching the US to be better.After DeGeneres came out in 1997, her sitcom lost viewers and, incredibly, was slapped with a parental warning she fell into a depression. So DeGeneres’s so-called rehabilitation to public affection is really a story of the US’s rehabilitation, when it finally and fully embraced a lesbian as a mainstream celebrity.However, those of us who have been watching DeGeneres for a while know that she has always been a lot spikier than her image suggests. This was implied in the now ironically headlined 2018 New York Times profile of her, Ellen DeGeneres Is Not as Nice as You Think, which was about how bored DeGeneres was with being pigeonholed as nice (well, at least you are not bored any more, Ellen). Her interviews could be prickly, such as the extremely weird time in 2012 when she kept pushing Taylor Swift about her alleged previous boyfriends, or the even weirder time when she humiliated an audience member – on international TV – for taking an extra Ellen cap from the merchandise table, hauling her up on stage and putting her “in jail”.DeGeneres has long said she is not as nice as people think – hell, she made a whole Netflix special saying exactly that. Whether she is significantly worse than every other entitled Hollywood asshole, or is just getting more grief for it due to being a womangayknown for niceness is a question that may be impossible to unpick.But there are definitely some morals to this story: after all the sagas at Fox News and NBC, people definitely don’t tolerate bad behaviour in TV any more – and that is a good thing becoming super-rich does not generally improve people’s behaviour and, finally, when someone – famous or not – tells you that they are not that nice, believe them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9c05a39289d15dd5f35f7189ac1f5f778459817/0_203_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21c493366fc6721ca662bc38750bd80d","title":"brentford fulham championship play off final match report","story":"Scott Parker hared down the touchline, his tie flinging every which way, as Fulham’s substitutes conga-ed down the stands to join the celebrations after Joe Bryan’s second goal sealed an immediate return to the Premier League. But in truth Bryan’s exquisitely taken first strike, approaching half-time in extra time, was the match-winner. In some ways it was audacious, in others incredible, but whatever it was, it was the goal that set them on their way.It came towards the end of a marathon, and sometimes excruciating, contest but after almost 105 minutes of action, Bryan’s invention pulled apart west-London neighbours separated by four miles of the Thames. It is a moment Bryan and Fulham will want to relive in the coming weeks but a goal David Raya, the Brentford goalkeeper, would rather never see again. Not that he can afford to wallow in it, with the new season only five weeks away.Raya was caught cold by Bryan’s craft, fooled from more than 35 yards, with Bryan raising his right hand as if to indicate to his swarm of teammates to attack the 18-yard box. But Bryan had other ideas and his quick thinking saw him deliciously bend the ball into the corner of the net with the goal gaping. The flight of the free-kick bounced inside the six-yard box and cannoned in. His second was equally sweet, calmly slotting underneath Raya after a neat give-and-go with the substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic, who moonlighted as a cheerleader until being introduced on the brink of extra time.The Brentford captain, Pontus Jansson, stood hands on hips, forlornly watching the celebrations unfold before trudging down the tunnel, head bowed. Tom Cairney lifted the winners’ trophy aloft before helping give Parker the bumps. This was not a bad way to cap his first full season in management. Christian Nørgaard could not bear to look, instead poking a ball around the 18-yard box as Fulham turned up the volume, buoyed by floorfiller anthems, serenading their talisman, Mitrovic, in a huddle. “Mitro’s on fire,” they roared.For Brentford, this was a galling defeat at the end of an extraordinary season – their last at Griffin Park – but, ultimately, they fluffed their lines on the biggest stage, their enthralling forwards and high-octane style absent. Ollie Watkins stung the palms of Marek Rodak but the Fulham goalkeeper was not truly troubled, with Raya the busier throughout. But, perhaps understandably given the magnitude of the prize on offer, victory worth £130m to Fulham. It was hardly the most colourful encounter in an eerily quiet arena, typified by the sound of Faryl Smith’s pre-recorded national anthem.It was a tentative and painstaking game comprising few clear chances, until Bryan’s goal stirred Fulham to life and punctured Brentford’s belief of returning to the top flight for the first time in 73 years. Their miserable play-off record continues: they have failed to gain promotion in any of their nine play-off campaigns. Given the season started 367 days ago, it was no surprise both teams appeared jaded, with Brentford notably a shadow of their free-flowing and fearless selves.Brentford survived a few hairy moments to take the game to extra time, with Raya smartly denying Josh Onomah, one of six players in the Fulham starting 11 with experience of playing in a play-off final. The captain, Cairney, scored the winner on Fulham’s previous visit to Wembley, when they prevailed against Aston Villa in this fixture in 2018.Parker was reluctant to trumpet the importance of such nous but acknowledged it was a worthless tool in isolation. On the night Fulham’s knowhow seemed to make a difference as they controlled large spells, forcing Brentford to feed off scraps.Fulham did not have it all their own way through and had Michael Hector to thank for another crucial intervention in the opening throes of a cagey encounter. The defender expertly glanced a dangerous Mathias Jensen cross out for a corner to prevent Bryan Mbeumo tapping in at the back post.

It was a poor tackle, which surely would have resulted in a stronger punishment had VAR technology been in use as Thomas Frank, the Brentford manager, had advocated.With three minutes of extra time remaining, Fulham all but extinguished Brentford’s hopes, with Bryan completing a wonderful give-and-go with Mitrovic, who arrived as a substitute at the end of normal time.

This leaves food and water resources open to infections and helps spread disease.This work references Nigerian-Yoruba sculptures and the healing qualities of water as a basic element of life. Yoruba believe water to be a symbol of force and strength.“This piece centres around the role of women and girls in society. Despite the significance of their contribution, women and girls have for generations been held captive by patriarchy.“I adopted a picture of a young woman carrying a load of empty jerrycans in search for clean water to cater for her family.“I thought that the model’s portrait would depict the plight of underprivileged women and children while the jerrycan denotes consumerism. Africa’s socioeconomic drive is so dependent on hard-working yet underprivileged women and children.”“Water allows us to celebrate, to relax, to socialise, to be joyful. This is a quality that we in the western world easily take for granted. My work very much talks about quality of life related to water and how access to clean water is essential for our soul as well as for our body.“I immediately thought of rain and how water falls from the sky that we all share. I then remembered taking photographs of people playing under the rain in Mexico … The water looked like stars.”“I wanted to create art that would represent the anguish and violence that go along with our planet’s problems. People do not realise how their own suffering is tied to the environment: to their long trip to fetch water, or their discomfort under the heat when the streets have no trees. Ghana is facing some of the most detrimental consequences from climate change and water shortages. Yet the government does nothing, so I have taken it upon myself to educate through art.”“My response is a reflection on how many of us, particularly when living in the west, we take the bathroom and easy access to water for granted.“Even those we consider despotic have easy access to such sanitation, while this is a right denied for many women and girls around the world, particularly those in the global south.”“The initial idea came from the constant reminders to wash hands and the NHS step-by-step guide during the time of coronavirus. I noticed that the steps to prevent the spread of the virus were dependent on three key things, clean running water from a tap (ideally with a modern faucet that could be turned off by using your elbow and not your hands), a soap dispenser with liquid soap and disposable paper towels. All of these are not universally accessible, even within the UK.“The sea reminds us that everyone is connected and that water is sacred.”“In the past, Bonthe was a thriving trade hub and economic centre. In the 80s, palm products and seafood became major industries. But like a sun-bleached photo taken of an exotic island town, where you can see things once were bright and new, now all that’s left is a vague image of what used to be. During the world wars the French and English navy used the town as a naval base. This Victorian water pump is a reminder that the right to clean water and decent toilets is a luxury afforded only to those who are fortunate.“The time to change this is now. Taking a moment to show gratitude for this seemingly basic right every time you wash your hands or take a shower adds another drop of water to the sea of change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929ec0d3305be22574c3cd26e5c9cee0d820f84a/0_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da51e6ac4c389858dc3282db595f1406","title":"the teacher the baker and the snack box maker meet the small firms going online for the first time","story":"Since lockdown, websites have become the main source of income for many small businesses and microbusinesses. Over the next month, we’ll follow two company owners, and the mentors we’ve paired them with, as they find their feet in the digital worldDespite never selling online in the 10 years since he cofounded his artisan bakery Bread Source, Steven Winter was left with little choice when the coronavirus lockdown was announced in March. As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. “At that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,” Winter says.The response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. “In the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,” he says. “We sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.” The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakery’s two delivery vans.Winter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for £1 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.Sakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving what’s becoming known as a second digital revolution: “One of the biggest barriers is people think it’s really complicated”, she says about launching a website. “Most microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, they’re doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise it’s something you definitely need. And with GoDaddy’s drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.”For Winter, it’s been transformational – the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. He’s keen to make the business’s digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakery’s database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. He’ll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source’s marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides – a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners – and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. “I think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,” says Mills-Smith.In Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. “When I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,” she says.She’ll now work with GoDaddy’s Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which she’ll charge. She’s also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.One of the challenges she knows she’ll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. “Yoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, it’s become very cool,” she says. “Meditation is still playing catch up … there’s a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.”But she won’t be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, we’ve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.Stone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyoga’s original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.“I always think of yoga as my love,” says Narain. “And I’m so lucky that I get to do it.” She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.The mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.“The wonderful thing about digital is it’s intuitive,” he adds. “So go and spend £20 on marketing. If it works well, spend £40 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think we’ve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19. People want to buy local, people want to know who’s behind the business. They’ll back you if they buy into who you are and what you’re trying to do.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

More than 200 days since coronavirus was first detected, public health authorities say the number of infections is accelerating and the peak still lies ahead. In early August, the world finds itself at a nebulous stage: past the shock of the pandemic but without a clear end in sight.  international correspondent Michael Safi talks to Rachel Humphreys about the different ways in which countries have dealt with the virus – from some in Europe who seemed to have bent the curve but are now experiencing a second wave to developing nations such as Pakistan who felt quarantine posed a greater risk to life than coronavirus itself.

He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed – it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family’s kitchen table.Before the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students’ creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children’s learning journey.Brown works as a support staff member at her daughter’s school, and considers the school’s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. “Daisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable – it’s working fantastically,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.”Distance learning isn’t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams – used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions – is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.For parents thrust into the role of home educator, it’s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child’s online education doesn’t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: “Even Maia’s school isn’t trying to replicate it – she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.“I think that’s a really good model – don’t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.”Safeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.A particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts – features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work. Microsoft 365 allows users to move seamlessly and securely from one device to another without complexity.For home-learning to be effective, Ciaran O’Halloran, head of drama at Our Lady and St Patrick’s college in Knock, Belfast, recommends focusing on healthy routines rather than slavishly following the school timetable. “A lot of the things that happen in school happen in order to manage hundreds of people effectively,” he says. “We spend a lot of time organising and socialising children so they can function in the school environment but without that, parents can be much more responsive.”Parents who want to support their child’s online learning do not need in-depth knowledge of the topics their child is studying, either. “I certainly don’t know everything and my kids know that,” laughs Dalpra. “You’re not an encyclopaedia we look things up together and they’re learning to ask for help, which is a really useful life skill.”With so little time to prepare for online learning, many households find themselves sharing limited resources. But Microsoft apps have the advantage of being accessible on all devices – meaning students can begin work in one place and move to another device seamlessly as required, reducing pressure on the main family device.“Microsoft apps don’t necessarily require children to work within them,” says O’Halloran. “A screenshot of task instructions on Teams can be viewed on a phone.”Equipping young learners with tools that enhance productivity and enable collaboration in this way – at the same time as encouraging them to flex their creativity – is key to developing the cognitive and problem-solving skills that will benefit them throughout life.For some children, online learning offers unexpected respite from the challenges of going to school. Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child’s needs. “One of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of inidual learners,” she says.An inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of inidual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools – such as Immersive Reader – are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text – students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.It’s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: “Children develop if they’re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child’s education.”Five tips to support online education1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn’t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children’s concentration.2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help – not all children are used to doing so.4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.5. Remember that you’re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you’re still learning too, and approach it together.Interested in finding out more about how to support your child’s online learning experience?

The total figure is, however, dwarfed by the more than £20,000 billed by the former Speaker, John Bercow, for work to the apartment in 2009.Although Hoyle’s bill is lower, it includes £7,523 on new mattresses and bedding. A lengthy note accompanying the spending states: “The replacement of mattresses and bedding was required as these had become damaged andor worn and no longer deemed suitable for new occupants. This cost included like-for-like replacement for four mattresses and associated bedding as well as bedding for other overnight accommodation provision on the parliamentary estate.”Hoyle became the 158th speaker in November last year, with the Lancastrian promising to bring calm to the chamber, which has seen bad-tempered debates in recent years, particularly over Brexit. The MP for Chorley, who has represented the constituency since 1997, was deputy speaker for nearly a decade before taking up the post.A spreadsheet of spending on “works to prepare the residence for the new Speaker’s occupancy” shows that £2,292 went on “works to flooring” and £1,300 on “heritage furniture polishing work”, as well as a further £1,300 on cleaning of non-heritage furniture. Supplying and installing “light pulls” cost £111 and removing redundant small wall fittings cost £110. The work took place in November and December 2019.Separately, £89,506 was spent in May and June 2020 on asbestos removal to support fire safety works. In June, July and August, fire safety works took place, costing another £9,243. A further £400 was billed for “heritage watching brief in support of the fire safety works” in May, as well as £3,715 for “heritage furniture disassembly in support of the works”. Maintenance to the heating system in April cost £2,120 and repairing a door lock in June cost £80. It means that in total, since Hoyle became speaker, £117,700 has been spent on the apartment.Bercow prompted controversy after being elected to the post in 2009 when figures emerged showing he spent £20,659.36 refurbishing the Speaker’s house in parliament. The spending was defended as necessary to make the apartment child-friendly for Bercow’s young family.A spokeswoman for the Speaker said: “After 10 years of use by the previous post holder and his family – who used it as their primary home – the Speaker’s residence needs renovating, updating and fire safety improvement work to take place. Unlike any other property, the Speaker’s residence is located within the Palace of Westminster, which is a Grade 1 listed building and a Unesco world heritage site, so alterations, repairs and replacement of soft furnishings need to be in keeping with the historic nature of the building.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61345c75dc90e987eb43e4009482fe5a9b071cbc/0_278_5298_3178/master/5298.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84d06771b225859d35b749b509eeba83","title":"number of uk citizens emigrating to eu has risen by 30 since brexit vote","story":"Analysis of data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Eurostat shows that migration from Britain to EU states averaged 56,832 people a year in 2008-15, growing to 73,642 a year in 2016-18.“These increases in numbers are of a magnitude that you would expect when a country is hit by a major economic or political crisis,” said Daniel Auer, co-author of the study by Oxford University in Berlin and the Berlin Social Science Center.According to interviews, half chose to leave the UK quickly. “Another important finding from the empirical evidence associated with Brexit is reduced levels of consideration and level-headedness in decision-making, with increases in levels of impulsiveness, spontaneity and corresponding risk-taking,” the researchers said.While the withdrawal agreement signed in January enshrines the residency, work and social rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in the rest of the bloc, it failed to guarantee the free movement rights of British migrants, restricting future employment and residency prospects in other member states.Co-author Daniel Tetlow said that “Brexit was by far the most dominant driver of migration decisions since 2016”. The jump in citizenship was “further evidence that an increasing number are making migration decisions to protect themselves from some of the most negative effects of Brexit on their lives”, the report said.The key loss for British nationals is the freedom to move country within the EU or to work or offer services across a border. This does not apply to EU nationals in the UK who retain free movement rights beyond Brexit courtesy of their EU member state citizenship.It means that unless British nationals take out citizenship in their host country, they can no longer work in or offer a service to another EU member state, impacting professions including accounting, law, architecture, translation and health.The biggest jump in migration was to Spain, where an estimated 380,000 British nationals live. Registration has not been essential in the country so many have lived there without being included in official Spanish immigration data, with an average of just 2,300 a year registering as migrating to the country between 2008 and 2015. After the referendum, this jumped fivefold, with 21,250 registrations in the two years between 2016 and 2018.The second most popular country for British nationals was France, which does not require registration of EU migrants. Between 2008 and 2015 the number of registrations was just over 500 a year. After the referendum this rose tenfold with 5,000 registrations over the following two years.In Germany, 14,600 Britons had dual nationality in 2019 compared to 622 in 2015. A total of 31,600 applied and received German citizenship in the three years after the referendum (2016 to 2019) with another 15,000 German passports expected for 2020. Overall half the estimated 120,000 Britons in Germany are expected to have dual citizenship by the end of this year.Interviews with migrants in Germany for the study found those who had made the move to the EU since 2015 considered it a “big risk” but were prepared to make the trade-off to secure future residency and employment routes across 27 countries.Tetlow said the rise in naturalisation numbers was a striking commitment “to integrate or socially embed”, with an increase in language learning and community involvement. “We’re observing a new social integration phenomenon and a redefining of what it means to be British European. In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians,” he added.Andreas Mitchell’s family moved from Scotland to Germany in 2018 after the 20-year-old was diagnosed with a form of leukaemia and they feared Brexit could delay medicines or treatment.Andreas said: “About six months after the referendum I was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. I was getting treatment but these kind of things can start deteriorating over the years, and eventually we decided we should probably leave in case things started to get difficult.“We had a fear that if a hard Brexit came there could be delays at the border with medicines coming through and my treatment would have to be prioritised and it would get interrupted by two or three weeks. With leukaemia you can’t wait a few weeks.”He added: “It became a question of should we stay, things deteriorating financially for the family – petrol into Aberdeen every day mounts up cost-wise and there was a risk if my treatment got postponed.”Mitchell’s German-born mother, Uschi, says they loved their life and home in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and they miss their family and friends there – but the town and area have already changed significantly because of Brexit.“Even without Covid-19 the economy had started to contract. People and investors alike became increasingly cautious when it came to spending money,” she said.They also considered Ireland and Italy, but Uschi got a job in Germany. Fear over Brexit was “the main factor”, she added. “Where we were wasn’t brilliant for work so we thought we would not be able to sustain ourselves and Andreas’s diagnosis was a big scare, so Brexit was the big push in the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/392ec09a98c10065e008bf46fcd22c7c0efb83ac/0_378_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=670e7d1f66351dfc757ddeac6bc5a2f4","title":"coronavirus alternative dwellings in the uk have you made a big change during lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from people who may have moved from homes to campers, canal boats and tents due to coronavirusWe would like to hear from people that have turned to alternative modes of outdoorsy living during the lockdown in the UK – such as campers, canal boats and tents – and ask whether they intend to ever return to conventional homes.

It is able to do really straightforward cases but the minute they get more complicated it struggles,” he said.Burnham said that in more deprived areas people were not returning calls from contact tracers because they cannot afford to self-isolate, and did not want to hand over contacts for them also to be told to miss work.He added: “The only way you can deal with these problems is a more local approach – door knocking and support for all employees to self-isolate. If anyone gets a request to isolate from test and trace, they should be able to do it immediately on full pay on the same principle as jury service.”Under the national system, call handlers aim to make contact with all infected people and those they have come into contact with, to advise them to self-isolate. If they cannot make contact after 10 calls, they are advised to move on to the next case.Tim Swift, leader of Calderdale council, said there was “two or three gaps” in the national system that it would plug with its own model, which it hopes to begin next Wednesday.He said the national call centre-based approach was fine for some areas, but was failing to understand “something as basic as getting names right” in communities where full names do not always “fit neatly into a first-name-surname function”.“We understand that and find it easier to handle,” he said. “You don’t want to just know someone is a private hire driver, but also where they work. And also you want to be able to follow up when people do not give full information and sometimes the only way to do that is to knock on a door.”Ben Leaman, consultant in public health at Calderdale, said the council would use native speakers of Urdu, Czech and Slovak to knock on the doors of people the national system had been unable to reach. All positive cases would get a text message from the council with a local number to call – a recognition of the fact many people were unwilling to call an 0300 number, often believing it to be a hoax. If they don’t reply within 24 hours they get a knock on the door.It is understood that the government is looking to ramp up its support for the worst-hit areas in England, including by assigning ring-fenced groups of contact tracers and providing them with scripts supplemented with local information.A spokesman for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said it was in discussions with Public Health England about establishing a similar operation to Blackburn, enabling it to contact people the national system had not been able to reach “of whom there are still too many”.Cumbria launched a local test and trace system at the end of May, when its director of public health, Colin Cox, was “deeply worried” that England’s lockdown restrictions were about to be relaxed without a national system in place.Cox said its programme was “making connections between cases that the national system is not making” and he would be happy to take on all contact tracing for the region “if we had the resources”.An example of the locally-driven approach, he said, was how they dealt with an outbreak in a pub. The national system would have simply told the infected person’s contacts to self-isolate, whereas local officials would contact the pub and try to reach all of its customers and issue a targeted local appeal.A government spokesman said: “Our priority is to curb the spread of this virus and save lives, and local action to tackle outbreaks and keep people safe is a crucial part of the national NHS test and trace service.“We continue to work closely with all local authorities and are providing targeted, additional support where needed, including in Blackburn with Darwen where we have assigned a ring-fenced group of NHS contact tracers to follow up positive cases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d387badd9cf6cb237b1e836eb222ad8dee792dc/0_206_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67f661367a39c8f132dc61295949055c","title":"online gamblers should prove they can afford losses report finds","story":"Social Market Foundation will call for a £100-per-month ‘soft cap’ on online lossesOnline gamblers should not be able to lose more than £100 a month without proving they can afford it, according to a report that will also call for betting websites that base themselves offshore to face stiffer taxes.Proposals from the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank build on growing clamour for the government to make sweeping changes to how the industry is regulated, following a string of high-profile stories about problem gambling.Among wide-ranging recommendations due to be published on Wednesday, the SMF will call for:The report recommends online gambling should be regulated much more like land-based bets, include a stake limit of between £1 and £5 on online slot machines, echoing similar proposals from a group of MPs.The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was cut from £100 to £2 from 2019 but at present there are no stake limits online.“Remote gambling is on the rise, yet remains outside the same controls applied to its land-based equivalents,” the SMF said.“It makes no sense that the same ‘obligation’ to reduce harm through limits to stake and speed should not be applied to an online sector which provides the most accessible content of all.”One of the most eye-catching proposals is a £100 “soft cap” on monthly losses, with customers who want to spend more subjected to strict affordability checks by an independent gambling ombudsman.Industry trade body the Betting \u0026amp Gaming Council (BGC) said its members already carry out affordability checks in some cases.“We disagree with the suggestion of an arbitrary and random low cap on spending and can think of no other area of the economy where the government determines how much an inidual can spend,” the BGC said.“Measures must be proportionate, evidence-led and fully thought through so as not to jeopardise the 100,000 jobs the industry supports or the over £3bn in tax revenues it generates for the Exchequer.”But the report questions whether the industry is paying its fair share, outlining reforms that would have significant ramifications for betting firms.The government levies a duty on online bets to ensure at least some tax is collected from firms that base themselves in offshore centres such as Malta and Gibraltar.But the SMF proposed tax incentives for companies that have a minimum “footprint” in the UK, to boost corporation tax receipts.The report’s authors said this would also create jobs and promote compliance with British gambling licence conditions, including the protection of vulnerable people and addicts.A similar proposal would bring an end to so-called “white label” agreements, where foreign firms with little incentive to protect UK consumers can buy access to the British market via an existing gambling licence holder.The SMF added its voice to calls for an overhaul of the 2005 Gambling Act, introduced under Tony Blair’s Labour government, citing changes in technology that “could not have been foreseen when the legislation underpinning that regulatory framework was first drafted”.The government has pledged to review the law and the public policy thinktanks called on ministers to consider redesigning the regulatory architecture it created.The report proposes a more strictly defined framework of sanctions available to the regulator, the Gambling Commission, which has admitted it is underfunded and has come in for criticism in two parliamentary reports.Changes would include a kitemarking scheme to promote good behaviour and additional regulators to beef up scrutiny of the sector and engage multiple government departments in oversight of the sector."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/318dfe95b31fbb92944d775ead52162210c35d73/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85d8aab3538e10e156152959d196af73","title":"tell

A brilliant run chase, masterminded by Ireland’s captain and vice-captain, Andy Balbirnie and Paul Stirling, centurions both, produced a stunning victory by seven wickets with one ball to spare. The target of 329 was one more than was required in the epic Ireland win in Bangalore in the World Cup in 2011. But in some ways this victory was more unlikely given the frailty of the Irish batting in the first two games.Here the senior men, Middlesex mates, came to the fore in a partnership of 214, which sealed the match and tormented England’s captain on the field. After Eoin Morgan had struck a century earlier in the day he was unable to take charge during the Irish innings because of “tightness in the groin”. So Moeen Ali took over, an experience that he may not remember with undiluted joy. On one occasion he yielded a no-ball as there were not enough fielders inside the ring.Stirling peppered the square boundaries from the start in his idiosyncratic style, creating width when there appeared to be none. He also calculated where to aim his sixes, namely to the shorter leg-side boundary, which Adil Rashid was defending in his first five overs. It may have been a mistake to use Rashid, the best trump card, at that end since Stirling cleared that boundary three times against him. Along the way Stirling gave two very tough chances to James Vince. Meanwhile Balbirnie paced his innings superbly his strikes were not so violent yet he scored almost as quickly as his partner, expertly minimising risks, hitting the gaps.The only way this pair could be parted was via a run-out when Stirling was (correctly) sent back. Balbirnie soon holed out in Rashid’s last over but then the young and old, Harry Tector and the hero of Bangalore, Kevin O’Brien, took over. They needed eight runs from the final over from Saqib Mahmood and a high full toss, given as a no-ball, sealed England’s fate. After the drab fare on the previous two games this was a terrific climax, except for the England camp.England’s innings was another helter-skelter affair, betraying the fact that some of the batsmen feel as if it’s still early April while others are in mid-season form. Jason Roy is in the first category and was caught at second slip in Craig Young’s first over Jonny Bairstow was in the second on Saturday but here he swung and missed against Mark Adair.However, a more significant failure came from Vince, who may have to return to the sidelines after another exasperating innings there was one more sublime cover drive and then he fell again in an odd fashion, this time to an inside edge off Young. Morgan soon put a stop to this nonsense. He timed the ball from the start and once again was the living embodiment of England’s approach – no matter what the situation, attack. Ireland peppered him with bouncers too often he can be vulnerable to such deliveries but here they came too frequently and too slowly, usually from Josh Little. Morgan latched on to them eagerly sometimes they landed among the bucket seats, which may have accounted for Ireland’s slow over rate.Morgan completed his 14th ODI century from just 78 balls to restore order but after he had sliced a drive to backward point the innings stuttered badly. Alongside Morgan, Tom Banton played his best innings for England so far, 58 from 51 balls. There were strokes of surprising power off the back foot and some thumping drives. He makes it look so easy that he leaves you waiting more. He soon followed Morgan back to the pavilion when surprised by a skidding leg break from Gareth Delany, a good option explored by Balbirnie. But this was an advance for Banton.Moeen is one of the batsmen in early April mode. Here he scrambled a rushed single and then a leading edge from a shortish delivery lobbed to extra cover.Suddenly batting has become an alien occupation for him. We assume he is in poor form but he hasn’t really been at the crease long enough for us – or him – to be sure. Then the emphatically in form Sam Billings was caught at mid-on and England had lost four wickets for 26.David Willey is doing his best to make himself an indispensable cricketer in this series. He was soon striking the ball with power and authority in his second ODI fifty from just 42 balls. With Tom Curran a dependable ally England recovered to 328. It should have been enough. It wasn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d402e1e0aeaa068b068a2d28ec1309809148b309/0_407_6149_3692/master/6149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4dd61536ccea9ceea7c13dd913cec3","title":"which sports and exercises have you been enjoying for the first time in uk","story":"During the lockdown, many people only left home for exercise.

What was exciting about Fame was the way it showed you’re in it because you’re prepared to commit your life to building a craft. It was a more realistic version of the industry. It captured hunger and desire and hard work.Going to performing arts school was life-changing for me. I went to Tring Park aged 11. I’d gone from my school in the West Midlands, where I was absolutely not popular, making up my own dances in the playground, to being in a place where people understood me and it made me thrive. Suddenly I had worth and a skill, and the fact I was passionate made me a cool person, which was the opposite of before. In my memory, the constant desire to create and perform that you see in Fame is absolutely truthful. We would be on our way to science in the morning and be spinning down the corridor, running up and down stairs tap-dancing. That was the way we communicated.I met Alan Parker when I choreographed Bugsy Malone at the Lyric Hammersmith in 2015. We were all really nervous about him watching the show, but he was so supportive. He had such a warmth and you could see the joy he got from watching the brilliant young performers. He was quite quiet sitting in the rehearsal room, holding his cards close to his chest, but he was really listening and watching, really paying attention. He was very complimentary about the choreography, but he said I could do better with the song Down and Out. The next year, when we revived the show, we started that scene again from scratch, and he was right.My love of Alan Parker began in 1987. I’d just made a record with Courtney Pine called Like Dreamers Do, and Alan used Courtney on the soundtrack of Angel Heart. Angel Heart was such a life changing film for me, as a person of colour especially. Alan brought race into his films in a way that was so true and honest. He was very ahead of his time in that way. The guy who played Leroy in Fame, Gene Anthony Ray, it was revolutionary to see a black man dancing like that, not just doing street dance but to turn it round into this classical thing.I toured in a musical of Fame based on Alan’s film, not on the TV series. I’ve done loads of theatre, but I’d never stayed on a musical more than six months. I did Fame for two years – that’s how much I loved the show, because the story is so good. It wasn’t the twee version, it was the real one. In the 80s everything was given sugar, soft filter, glamour, but Alan went dark.I was 17 when I signed to Island Records. You become famous, suddenly you have this power, then the vultures come out. You get people who are very jealous, people who wish it was them and they come to destroy you. This is the industry. Alan always showed the reality, and that’s why I loved him.It must have been the early 80s when I saw Fame and it had a massive effect on me. I always loved musicals but I remember being struck, as I always have been by Alan Parker’s films, by how he isn’t scared of letting the darker tones seep through. There were these brilliant moments of joy – when they were dancing on top of the cab, going crazy – but mostly everyone was struggling, and I remember how much hard work it all looked, the cost of it. Because a lot of students are quite vulnerable, that’s why they end up falling into the arts, because it’s somewhere for them to explore that vulnerability in a safe place.I went to Sylvia Young theatre school when I was 14. The TV series was on then, and there was this mad craze with everyone wearing their leg-warmers and headbands and me thinking I was so lucky because I was at a school where we did that. Does it reflect what training’s really like? Yes and no. The competition and jealousy, I don’t remember that at all. At Silvia Young, it was very bohemian, we’d all be jumping around dancing and doing improvisation or a hardcore ballet class and then trying to settle down to double maths. We did all feel like we were the kids from Fame. We’d get on the tube and all sing and it was exhilarating. That’s what I remember: the world of possibilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf36ac524f799b764bacbfcb78adc2036a464923/0_298_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6af53163f31b9a2aefa62eb640c4198","title":"christmas panto cancellations theatres uk industry","story":"They fill the coffers, nurture audiences and enable venues’ other activities. Pantomimes are pivotal for the UK stage industry – a year without them could be catastrophicIt’s like a scene from Dr Seuss’s Grinch. Week by week, pantomimes across the land are being cancelled. For many families, there will be no date with the dame this Christmas due to uncertainty about easing lockdown restrictions for theatres. Though it is only August, pantos take months to prepare and many venues and producers have been unable to commit to spending money on shows that might be scrapped. Theatr Clwyd in Mold, the Tron in Glasgow and Sheffield Theatres are among those that have postponed their pantos until next year. On Monday, Canterbury’s Marlowe theatre did the same. Its Christmas production is normally seen by 100,000 people.Michael Harrison, joint owner of the huge Qdos Pantomimes operation, has been calling for greater clarity about the timing for stages four and five of the UK government’s roadmap to reopening theatres, which would permit larger audiences for indoor performances. For Qdos’s panto season to happen “as we know it”, Harrison said he needed to know target dates for reopening by the start of August. With culture secretary Oliver Dowden’s recent confirmation that a timeframe is now unlikely to be given until November at earliest, Qdos says it is “left with no choice but to begin the consultation process with our partner theatres about the viability of each show”.Many UK households who consider a panto trip one of the essential trimmings of Christmas will be disappointed. But the effects of cancellations will be felt deeply for theatres themselves long beyond the festive season. As Andrew Lloyd Webber recently said, pantos are the “lifeblood” of regional theatre.Gayle Knight is the creative director of Civic Arts centre and theatre in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire. Christmas, she says, is “our big income generator, like for every other theatre in the country”. They get packed houses for the panto for two straight weeks and attract many school groups. “We’ve already heard from headteachers in the area that they won’t be coming to the panto this year because it will be too difficult,” she says.Indoor performances with social distancing are set to be allowed from later this month. If still in place by winter, the rule would mean the 457-seat theatre would have an audience of 140. “That makes it completely unviable at our traditionally busiest period,” says Knight. “If we don’t have a good Christmas then we really struggle in January and February, which is our quietest time.”The Civic would have been celebrating its 10th anniversary this month. The venue is in an area currently under stricter lockdown rules than other parts of the UK, and Knight is planning to reopen in September. Her team of eight has been furloughed. “If we can’t open fully for Christmas then that’s when we’ll have problems,” she says. The theatre may put on an Easter panto instead. They have had small grants from the local council and from Arts Council England’s emergency fund, and have fundraised. Knight hopes the government will consider extending the furlough scheme beyond October for small venues like hers, rather than ending it at a time when full indoor performances may still not be permitted. Otherwise, she says, the Civic will be open but unable to trade properly and “it negates the good work that the government has done done on job retention”.The Civic has a vital role in the community. Before the pandemic, the building was buzzing. As many as 2,000 people a week visit the centre, not just to watch shows but for activities including dance classes, drama groups, knitting and photography classes. Knight remembers when a group of parents came to see their children’s drama show and enjoyed it so much they decided to put on their own production. If the Civic wasn’t there, its community would have to travel a considerable distance for a similar provision, she says. When a small theatre in a small town closes, she adds, it will likely remain closed for ever.Panto has given generations of people their first taste of theatre. There is a risk, this year, that a new intake of panto fans will miss out – and these would be the theatregoers of the future. “If we don’t have panto this year, are families going to fall out of the habit and not return next year,” asks Worthington. And if audiences get used to watching theatre online, he adds, will they come back for the real thing?The thing that makes panto special – its boisterous interactivity – is what makes it problematic during a pandemic. These are shows that shower the audience with sweets, dragoon audiences into ridiculous situations on stage and involve as much shouting as possible. The Tron in Glasgow, which is postponing The Wonderful Wizard of Oz written, directed and performed by Johnny McKnight, said in a statement that, beyond the financial risk, “we very much feel that pantomime needs to be enjoyed in a packed auditorium”. Interaction is integral to the experience, it said, and anything different “would be shortchanging our audiences”.Pantomime, Worthington stresses, is at the heart of the theatre ecology. He quotes the title of a book about Salisbury Playhouse: Putting on Panto to Pay for the Pinter. The Christmas box-office bounty enables regional theatres to stage a variety of other work. Those venues are themselves inseparable from the more prominent, better-funded organisations in bigger towns on the UK theatre map. Snobbery about panto and regional theatre persists. Small, rural theatres such as the Civic are often thought of as a “poor relative to the larger venues”, says Knight, but are a “breeding ground for talent. Without us, many of the stars of the West End wouldn’t be where they are today. We are equally as professional as larger venues but on a more modest budget and with more modest ambition.”Worthington is concerned that the government’s £1.57bn emergency culture funding will show a bias to arts “with a capital A” such as what Dowden called the “crown jewel” buildings. “In the rural locations we go to,” Worthington stresses, “these regional venues are the crown jewel to that community.” The great fear is that by next Christmas, for some regions, it won’t just be a panto that is missing – but the theatre itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159804e20a5e2052ecd1e0e5d4641be21599400d/0_359_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9fa88fba633ad6516ac883940fa5f7d","title":"first time uk campers tell us about your experiences","story":"Lockdown restrictions and desire to remain within country caused so-called ‘staycation’ boom as people flock to campsitesWe would like to hear from readers who have gone – or are about to go – on a camping holiday in the UK for the first time due to travel restrictions and a desire to stay within the UK.Why are you a newbie camper?

Among her favourite guests are the Swiss man who she nicknamed “James Bond” for his flash white sports car (which looked a tad out of place in the hamlet of Specchia Gallone, especially alongside her Mini ) the interior designer from London the couple who asked her to witness their wedding and the six lesbians from Canada who she hung out with by the pool, chatting and laughing.“Those women were such great fun,” said the 61-year-old. “The most beautiful thing about this job is getting to know people.”But this year, owing to the coronavirus pandemic, there are few people to chat to.“It is a strange year, and sad to see something that was so lively now so quiet. We were like one big family,” said Gilda, whose two daughters help her manage the business when they can.“We were fully booked for the season by January: many people were returning guests, but then they cancelled their bookings because of the pandemic,” said Gilda.For Palazzo Siena, as with other hotels that have reopened, trying to stay afloat has meant reducing prices. The season began late because of the national lockdown. The pricing strategy prompted a trickle of bookings in June and July August is looking more promising. Another selling point is that Salento and the wider Puglia region have been fairly unscathed by Covid-19, with fewer than 5,000 confirmed cases since the onset of the pandemic in February.The majority of Palazzo Siena’s guests usually come from the UK, the US and Canada. This year, the foreign visitors who have made the journey so far are from neighbouring countries. Austrian Sylvia Fragapane, her Italian husband Fabio, and their daughter drove 14 hours from their home in Switzerland and booked a three-night stay at Palazzo Siena. It was the family’s first visit to Puglia.“We chose Puglia because there are few Covid cases,” Sylvia said. “And we were careful when picking a place to stay – we could tell Palazzo Siena was a beautiful home to stay in, nice and spacious and unlike normal hotels.”Palazzo Siena is somewhat of an oasis amid a pandemic. The building, once owned by a family of rich merchants, had lain abandoned since the 1960s before Gilda caught wind that it was for sale during a conversation with a fellow diner at a pizzeria in nearby Otranto, while on holiday there in 2010.“It was destroyed, but as soon as the door opened it hit me how beautiful it was,” said Gilda, who had never undertaken a project of its kind before. After a brief tussle with another keen buyer, the property was hers.It took a year to restore. Customers soon started to arrive, mostly by word of mouth. The nine airy rooms are impeccably furnished, retaining the building’s original features. Guests fall asleep to nothing but the sound of chirping crickets and wake up to the sound of church bells. Centuries-old vines cover the ancient colonnade in the vast garden, which is home to fig, walnut and almond trees. The vegetable patch provides ingredients Gilda uses in local dishes, including pumpkin flower risotto with burrata, the mozzarella-like cheese from Puglia, and courgette tart. While there’s no restaurant as such, meals can be ordered in advance and served either on the terrace or in the dining room.The pool – which is cleaned by the same person who cleans the pool at the holiday home of actress Helen Mirren in Miggiano, about a half hour’s drive away – offers respite from the afternoon heat.“This is a holiday for people who want peace and to relax,” said Gilda. “Many wake up early, to swim and do some exercise. There are lots of quiet spots to read. There are walking and bike trails nearby. People don’t have to think about dressing up or putting on makeup. For me, this is the real Salento – simplicity.”Specchia Gallone is a neat hamlet of fewer than 500 people, with little entertainment beyond a bar and restaurant. It can be reached by car from Brindisi airport, or by once-daily bus from the baroque city of Lecce, from where you can catch a train to the nearby town of Poggiardo. However, a car is essential for exploring the pristine beaches and remote villages of the Salento.The closest beach to Specchia Gallone, a 20-minute drive away, is Porto Badisco, an inlet with a small sandy beach and rocks from which local youth plunge into the clear water. As legend would have it, the Trojan hero Aeneas made a stopover in Porto Badisco after his escape from Troy.On a recent Thursday morning, the beach was packed, with little social distancing in evidence.“Fewer people are coming but it’s still impossible to find a parking space,” said resident Gino Castaldi.The beachgoers are mostly locals and other Italians on holiday.“I usually like to travel abroad, but this year I’m discovering Italy more,” said Claudio Ressa, an IT specialist from Milan, in Lombardy, the region worst-affected by coronavirus. “The situation in Milan was so heavy. But here I feel relaxed, as there are not so many cases. The people are also welcoming.”More breathing space can be found in Alimini, north of Otranto, where a long stretch of beach is backed by sand dunes and pinewoods. Most of the beach is taken up by private establishments, with lounger and umbrella rental for about €8 a day. The beach businesses must follow strict coronavirus rules, including maintaining adequate space between loungers and disinfecting the beds between customers.Salento’s economy was once fuelled by the tobacco industry, but all that remains today of that era are abandoned factories. Olive oil is a major product, but growers have been badly affected by another infectious disease – Xylella fastidiosa – a plant pathogen that has killed tens of thousands of olive trees in recent years. That leaves the region heavily dependent on tourism. Villages would usually draw visitors through cultural events and sagre, food festivals showcasing local specialities. But these have mostly been cancelledthis year.“It all went up in smoke,” said Remo De Pascalis, a bakery owner in Giuggianello, close to Specchia Gallone. “All the women usually collaborate to make traditional dishes. Sagre bring small communities together but also attract plenty of tourists – they are the event of the year.”Restaurants, especially those with ample outdoor space, are managing to hold up.“We lost April and May in the lockdown but since we reopened in early June, there has been a steady flow of people,” said Barbara Vincenti, co-owner of Matisse, a restaurant in Uggiano la Chiesa, near Specchia Gallone and recommended for its seafood. “We have a garden so we manage to distance the tables well. For the moment, we are not doing too badly. But I worry about the winter, as people might not want to eat inside. Plus, we don’t know what awaits us with the virus.”The season at Palazzo Siena wraps up in October, when Gilda returns to her home in Bari. She’s not expecting much from the next few months, but hopes to see her friends return in 2021.“This year has been different,” she said. “I just hope that nothing else happens and that we can soon get back to normal.”• Palazzo Siena has a special rate of €190 a night for its comfort rooms in August and September (normal rates in August from €223-€366).

The BBC are set to produce a scripted comedy based around one such facility, partnering with an organisation who works with young people who have been removed from mainstream education.The pilot, titled PRU, is a collaboration between the corporation’s online-only channel BBC Three, targeted at 16- to 34-year-olds, and the youth production company Fully Focused. Aiming to “authentically capture the unpredictable nature of PRU life, a world seldom seen by the public”, it will follow four “complex but seemingly self-destructive kids who say the unsayable and do the undoable”.Director Teddy Nygh and writers Alex Tenenbaum and Nathaniel Stevens have experience working with young people, including those in referral units, while Fully Focused helps young people from underrepresented backgrounds enter the creative industries.The young people Fully Focused works with have “‘lived experience’ of the issues we portray in our drama, comedy and documentaries”, Henry said. “This includes young people who’ve attended PRUs, have experience of the youth justice system and are known to borough youth offending teams.” As well as providing support and mentoring, Fully Focused allows young people to use their own experiences to inform their work with the organisation.Shane Allen, the BBC’s head of comedy commissioning, described the script as crackling with “terrific dialogue from sharply drawn characters in a world we haven’t seen before in sitcoms – all imbued with truth, heart and hilarity. Fully Focused bring their ethos and emphasis on authenticity and representation of young voices both on and off camera.”Previous BBC Three pilots or Comedy Slices include People Just Do Nothing and Liam Williams’ Ladhood.Founded in 2010, Fully Focused channels its profits into training programmes, and runs a YouTube channel, Million Youth Media, featuring short films aimed at young people of colour. PRU’s four teenage leads will be found via an open casting call, which launches online today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/614056ada66123352e8081bd0784334e5c214fcb/81_0_2263_1359/master/2263.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e6ec2f783e6d2b269065536f7be2751a","title":"cursed shock despair beirut explosion rocks city lebanon","story":"Lebanese capital in state of chaos as people grapple with scale of blast that has injured thousandsAs a ghostly brown haze began to clear, the streets of east Beirut emerged in apocalyptic ruin. Even 4km from the centre of  the blast each building had lost some, if not all, of its windows. It was just after 6pm. Smoke, dispersed with pockets of pink gas, shrouded some of the carnage. Huge shards of glass covered roads – some jagged pieces had ripped through cars. Trees were shredded, and pools of blood formed puddles in the streets.Blood trails led to the cars and motorbikes that had sped the injured away to clinics or hospitals, which within minutes of the explosion were struggling to cope with the number of dead and injured.Ambulances wailed along the city’s boulevards, speeding past intersections gridlocked by the sheer numbers of cars trying to flee and the weight of hazards they had to pass. The mushroom cloud that had billowed over the nearby port was being pushed to the east, but it towered in some form for almost half an hour.Walking down through the east Beirut suburb of Ashrafieh to Gemmayze and towards the site of the blast at the port, the devastation was even more comprehensive. Dozens of buildings had clearly sustained structural damage. Shops, and restaurants were almost all severely damaged. A whole nightclub district was virtually wiped out. Weeks of sustained artillery shelling had not caused the same amount of ruin, even during the peak of the civil war.Men, women and children were walking, bewildered, from somewhere near the blast site. Few were hurrying. Many were abandoning what remained of their homes, heading for nowhere in particular. It was just as difficult to get past the debris on foot as it was by car.It takes a lot to shake Beirut, which has risen and fallen under bombs before. But in a city inured to explosion, this was something new. An economic implosion had left a country on edge. Now a devastating explosion of a dimension that few could comprehend. “We’re cursed,” said one man, in his early 20s, blood streaming down his wrist from a glass cut. “Even if this was an accident, it’s the last thing we could afford.”The last time a blast anywhere near this size had rocked Lebanon was in February 2005, when the former prime minister Rafik Hariri was killed by a car bomb outside a waterfront hotel. More than 15 years later, a result in the trial of his accused killers is due in The Hague on Friday, and there were fears the explosion could be a harbinger of the verdict.“Nothing happens without a reason here,” said Sobhi Shattar, as he swept debris from the front of the former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn’s house in a well-to-do street. “This could be a message for everyone to back off.”The focus quickly became what had blown up and how, with everybody having a theory. The blast wave was felt as far away as south Beirut, and was heard 80km (50 miles) away in northern Lebanon. There were reports that the sound of the explosion was heard 250km (160 miles) to the west in Cyprus.“Only huge quantities of high explosives could do that,” said Riyadh Haddad, a local engineer. “Something at the port either blew up by itself, or got targeted.”Like his neighbours in the entertainment district of Gemmayze, Haddad had a lot of work to do to make his house habitable. “Look at it,” he said. “How do we recover? There are at least 1m windows missing across the city, and that’s the least of our worries. No money, jobs, power, fuel. And now this. Will it be a wake-up call, or will there be a war?”In the early aftermath, Lebanese officials were blaming the chaos on a storage of fireworks igniting in a catastrophic accident. That version was debunked by the sheer size of the explosion and reach of the blast wave.The Interior minister, Mohamed Fehmi, later told the MTV Lebanon channel that the explosion appeared to have been caused by “huge quantities of ammonium nitrate” being stored at the port. But the announcement was not enough to put an end to rampant speculation.“Was this a weapons storage centre?” asked one man, frantically trying to phone his friends. “Did the Israelis hit it? There was a small explosion, then a bigger one. What caused the first?”Rumour and intrigue spread as fast as the shockwave, and by nightfall, Lebanon’s security chief, Gen Abbas Ibrahim, had debunked the fireworks theory and blamed an industrial accident in a warehouse depot, which he said had housed highly combustible chemicals.Not everyone was convinced. “In all the history of Lebanon, there has never been anything like this,” said another man, in his 30s, as he swept glass out his front door. “This was almost thermonuclear, and I think it was a lot of military-grade explosives that went up. Will they ever be truthful about it? I doubt it.”As night closed in, Beirut was darker than ever. The waning electricity that recently could barely keep the city going was barely needed, for once. The city was rapidly emptying. The lights were no longer on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3602fed3cf169e70beb8bee84bcd465041162001/405_0_1736_1042/master/1736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ed90895e3f7291825177147aee23cc4","title":"hiroshima bombing 75th anniversary racism atomic","story":"On the 75th anniversary of the A-bomb, a Japanese American writer speaks to one of the last living survivors – and traces connections from Malcolm X to the fight to end nuclear warI keep a red file folder, its edges faded from nearly three decades of exposure to dust and light. Inside, the title words I typed in 1991: “The Atomic Bombing of Hiroshima.” It is the first research paper I ever wrote. Tucked inside of the folder’s front flap are three stapled index cards, each with reference titles written in smudged pencil. The first book listed is the one that mattered to me most: the journalist John Hersey’s 1946 nonfiction classic Hiroshima. The book’s scenes, vivid and wrenching, are lodged inside my memory. Particularly this one, about the Rev Kiyoshi Tanimoto, pulling bomb victims from a sand pit: “He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge, glove-like pieces.”Hersey introduced me to Mr Tanimoto, a man who wore his hair parted down the middle and moved through crowds of mangled, dying people, bringing water and apologizing: “Excuse me for having no burden like yours.” At a time when Japanese people were roundly excoriated in the US, portrayed as demons, yellow monkeys, and savages deserving of death, one historian claimed Hersey’s book transformed “subhuman Japs back into Japanese human beings”. His omniscient, controlled voice felt godlike and all-knowing, free from authorial editorializing. He was hailed as a writer who “let ‘Hiroshima’ speak for itself”.When I first read the book in 1991, I was struggling to make sense of my place among some Americans who still – 46 years after the bomb – saw someone like me as subhuman. I was a child with a Japanese immigrant father (he was born three years after the bomb) and a white mother. I grew up in a small midwestern town as one of only a handful of Asians. There was name-calling: “Chink.” “Gook.” “Jap.” There were days when white kids threw rocks at me on the playground or recited the all-too-common phrase: “Go back to where you came from.” Being anti-Asian was an easy fallback for your garden-variety middle school bullies. I have memories of hiding in a blue paint-chipped bathroom stall, wondering what was wrong with me.White mothers do their own kids of color no favors by claiming colorblindness. But my father did not mention such racial matters either. There is a phrase in Japan, “ba no kuuki wo yomu”, which means “to read the air”. It is an unspoken practice of sensing a person’s feelings, or a situation, without words. Decades later, when I had my own kids, my mother would tell me that she and my father watched a documentary together, early in their marriage, about the internment of Japanese Americans. It ended, and they sat there in silence. Neither knew how to talk to the other about racism, much less their own kids. Uncomfortable facts fluttered in the atmosphere, never to be addressed.When my teacher, Mrs Ott, assigned a book report about a historical event in middle school, I asked my father what I should write about.“What about the atomic bomb they dropped on Japan?” he said, as if we had discussed this event my entire life. I had no idea what he was talking about. I only knew that once I had stumbled across my father cleaning the hot tub he had built with slabs of wood in our backyard. Staring at the sky as it began to drizzle, he muttered something about how Americans never knew “black rain”.Reading Hiroshima, I learned how Mr Tanimoto ran to look for his wife and baby, encountering hundreds of fleeing people along the way. “Many were naked or in shreds of clothing,” Hersey wrote. “On some undressed bodies, the burns had made patterns – of undershirt straps and suspenders.” The shapes of flowers from kimonos seared on to their skin.My personal torment suddenly fit into a context of racism and war. Classes at school did not teach me about the internment of Japanese Americans, nor about all of the rest of the groups deemed subhuman. So, as a teenager, I went searching for more books that did.I was 15 when my grandmother in Osaka died. I flew to Japan with my father and brother. We lit incense and prayed at an altar inside of my grandmother’s home, which smelled grassy from the tatami mats. Her house slippers lay on the kitchen floor, her purse hung on a door, her bedroom closets stacked with satiny kimonos wrapped in tato-shi paper.Late at night my family shared stories of my grandmother. My uncle told me how she ran from second world war bombs, holding him as a baby in her arms. A few days later, we boarded a bullet train bound for Hiroshima.Mr Tanimoto did end up finding his family on the day of the bomb. His wife had been at home when everything around them exploded. She told her husband how “the wreckage had pressed down on her, how the baby had cried”, as Hersey wrote. “She saw a chink of light, and by reaching up with a hand, she worked the hole bigger, bit by bit.” She climbed out with their daughter, Koko, wearing a blush-colored baby gown.Koko Kondo’s story began where Hersey’s book left off. Kondo, I would later learn, grew up with an unfiltered view of the bomb’s devastation. Orphan girls showed up at her church when she was a child, their lips burned into their chins, eyelids seared off, fingers melted together. Her father founded the Hiroshima Maidens project, to raise money for reconstructive surgery and health care for Japanese women and girls scarred and mutilated by the atomic bomb. Kondo hated the people who did this to them.When Kondo was 10, she boarded a plane to America. Her father was already en route to the US to speak on behalf of the Hiroshima Maidens. Her mother had been summoned, along with Kondo and her three younger siblings. They did not have passports and did not know why it was so important for them to come to the US right away. But when they arrived at the airport, one of its employees greeted them and said: “We have been waiting for you.” Within minutes, her family members received their passports.They landed in Los Angeles, and after settling in, Kondo’s family was whisked to the NBC studios, where her father was already waiting backstage to appear on the television show This Is Your Life. What happened next would go down as one of reality television’s most exploitive moments. I cannot watch the clip without feeling queasy and disgusted.Mr Tanimoto thought he was there primarily to talk about the Hiroshima Maidens. He did not know that he would end up walking through the day of the bombing before a live audience, fake sirens blaring on stage, a melodramatic host narrating with tawdry music and theatrics, in between commercials for nail polish. Tanimoto, in the black-and-white video, looked confused, emotional, and even frightened as people from his life walked on stage one by one. Then, a shadowy figure behind a screen spoke into a microphone: “Looking down from thousands of feet over Hiroshima, all I could think of was, ‘My God what have we done?’”Kondo and her family had no clue before they arrived, but the producers had invited Robert A Lewis, the co-pilot of the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. “You’ve never met, you’ve never seen him,” the host said, “but he’s here tonight to clasp your hand in friendship.” Lewis emerged, taller and stockier than Tanimoto, who seemed solemn and tense as he shook his hand. Lewis said it again: My God, what have we done?The other pilot flying the Enola Gay, Paul Tibbets, died without ever expressing regrets. But when Kondo heard Lewis reveal his conscience on TV that day, she realized: “He’s a human being like me.” Today, Kondo tells audiences that in that moment, she decided to hate war instead of him. “I walked slow, just like a crab, toward him,” Kondo would later recall. She reached for his hand, and he held hers in return. Kondo would speak of feeling grateful to Lewis, for helping her realize this shared humanity.But when I watch that television moment from 1955, seeing Kondo as that empathic little girl, thrust into such a grand orchestration, I can’t muster that same mercy and reconciliation. I can’t help but think of how people of color, throughout history, have been expected to forgive their oppressors and murderers so white audiences can feel better.I also know that every story is more complicated than our meaning-seeking brains sometimes allow them to be. I know a human being can be a living contradiction of evil and good. A heart can feel compassion for the same person for whom it also holds contempt. And I know that a single soul can hold within it two opposing sides of the same war. No matter the nuances, I know too that at some point one side always wins.In the days after my grandma in Osaka died, I carried a spiral notebook through Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park and its museum, taking notes on the video testimonies from survivors: “I remember seeing a picture of hell once,” a survivor said, “but it had green in it. Hiroshima had only three colors, red, black and brown … and in the middle people were screaming.”I stood before cascades of multicolored paper cranes. I photographed the charred tricycle of three-year-old Shin-ichi, who had been riding in front of his house when his father saw the flash of light. “He died that evening,” I wrote. “The father buried the young boy in his backyard alongside his tricycle, so it would continue to be his playmate.” Shin-ichi’s father later removed his son’s remains for a proper burial and donated his tricycle to the museum.If there is genetic predisposition to becoming a writer, mine most likely came from my mother’s side. Her father, my grandfather, fought in the US army in Germany during the second world war. He also taught memoir writing classes to retirees at his local community center until he was 88. Four of his five adult children wrote their own books.My American grandfather was a gentle, jovial man who tutored me in math and encouraged my journalism. In his own life chronicles, he wrote of his platoon assignment in Lucherburg, Germany: “The now crusted route along a lonely dirt road led past a pair of dead horses, which smelled bad enough for us to walk around. Then, past a face-up fourteen-year-old lad in enemy uniform. Tough for them, unimportant to us.” My grandfather never actually wanted to be there, fighting in a war. His own mother had emigrated to the US from Germany.It was through my grandfather’s stories that I also learned more about my grandmother’s brother, Jim, a graduate student of the University of Wisconsin who studied nuclear physics. Jim had been recruited right out of college to work on a top-secret project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Years later, the family would come to find out what Jim had been working on all of that time: the Manhattan Project. My American great-uncle, as it turned out, helped build the very same atom bombs that destroyed Hiroshima, and three days later, Nagasaki.It was a stunning piece of family information that didn’t really sink into my psyche for years.Was the family proud of his work? I eventually asked my aunt.“Yes. Americans were told that this was what ended the war,” she replied. Scientists “were there to split atoms. Each person had their job to do – a small part of the big picture. Very few people knew what the end result was supposed to be.”And with those words, my mind flashed again to that end result: Mr Tanimoto lifting slimy living bodies and carrying them away from the tide, as Hersey described. Tanimoto repeating to himself: “These are human beings.”With Hersey’s Hiroshima, and with the story of my great-uncle Jim, I grappled with my own contradictions. We are often taught to embrace nuance, in literature and in life. In Latin, the word nuance began with “nubes”, or clouds, floating in the air. In French, nuance became shades of color, the mixing of colors, variations in tone. Check more than one box, I learned growing up. Include every part of yourself. Be ambiguous.For me being biracial meant figuring out on my own that this society, actively racist against me, also wanted to fold me into a kind of racelessness. When it really came down to it, I realized such a middling existence was a lie. I love all of my family. But I have only ever walked through this world as an Asian American. If internment came, my whiteness would not have spared me then, just as it would not now.The atomic bomb spared Koko Kondo’s father’s life. But somehow it seemed to steal him away from her too. Her father never abandoned his mission to help survivors. It so completely consumed him that for much of Kondo’s life, she felt as if he had forgotten her.Kondo explained this reality to me, these contradictions she harbored growing up, nearly three decades after I first read about her as the Rev Kiyoshi Tanimoto’s baby in Hersey’s book. I felt humbled in her presence, even though we were 5,500 miles apart, meeting over Zoom in the midst of our shared Covid-19 reality.Kondo, now 75, is a spirited woman with a crown of silvery hair, wispy eyebrows, and a beauty mark on her left cheek. She sat in the back of her church, in the city of Miki, Japan, raindrops tapping on the rooftop, her back facing the empty pews and pulpit.When she was a child, her father, the reverend, was always traveling, speaking, working on the Hiroshima Maidens project. “I wanted to go out for a walk with him, or sit on his lap, but there was no way I could do that,” Kondo told me. “I missed him so much.”As Kondo grew older, she learned that the radiation inside of her body had ravaged any chance of her bearing children. A man she had hoped to marry left her because of it. Kondo became an atheist. She went to college in the United States. With every anniversary, her father continued to speak about the bomb, living his commitment to help those that it hurt. Meanwhile, Kondo told herself that her father’s service-driven path would not be hers.Kondo did not have to be a frontline activist for people to know that she hated the atomic bomb. They could sense that much without articulation. The survivors of the atomic bomb – known as “hibakusha” – often found themselves shunned in Japanese society, viewed as contagious or abnormal. Some hid their hibakusha status from their own family members, or pledged never to speak of the bomb, for fear of discrimination or alienation. Noble as her father’s activism was, Kondo told herself for a long time that his mission would not be hers to follow.But there is no playbook for what happens to the little girl who realizes that little girls like her can be hated, maimed or murdered for who they are and where they are from. Parents cannot predict whether their child will grow up broken by such harsh truths. Or whether she will figure out a way to one day feel empowered to speak out.When her father was the same age Kondo is today, he tripped and tumbled to the ground. Mr Tanimoto broke his chin and jaw. Suddenly, the man who had spent his whole life speaking up for Hiroshima survivors had lost his ability to talk at all. He never regained his words.He died soon after. By then, Kondo’s outlook on his life’s mission had changed. She was one of the hibakusha, whose ranks grew thinner each year.You can live a kind of middling existence for a long time. Not firmly outspoken on a side. “Reading the air” is a kind of social and emotional intelligence, a way of silently tuning into other’s feelings. But it can also be about following a majority, reading the room to fit oneself ambiguously into a scene without disruption.Kondo had lived in the US during the height of the civil rights movement, first at a junior college in New Jersey, and then as a student at American University in Washington, DC. She learned about freedom protests for Black Americans, and she came to admire the Rev Martin Luther King Jr, who wrote: “The tendency of most is to adopt a view that is so ambiguous that it will include everything and so popular that it will include everybody.”Kondo realized her own calling when it came to social justice was to take on the legacy of Hiroshima. She decided she did not just want to see nuclear weapons controlled or curtailed. She wanted them abolished. And she knew that for as long as she still had her voice, she would continue to tell their story – Hiroshima’s story – to anyone who would listen. Today, Kondo has one unequivocal pursuit: a nuclear-weapon–free world. “For the sake of the children,” she told me.The second time I visited Hiroshima, in 2017, I brought my daughter. She was just four, standing before the skeletal remains of the Atomic Bomb Dome, a structure that had been directly underneath the explosion yet somehow avoided total destruction. My daughter, in a peachy pink button-down dress and purple sneakers, curled her fists and furrowed her brows. We tried to explain the atomic bomb that day. The senseless loss of lives. I would not show her the charred tricycle, which is still inside of the museum.My mixed-race daughter, who has my Japanese and white ancestry, is Black. Her father, my husband, was born in Jamaica, raised in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where he was slammed on the hoods of police cars by cops when he was a kid playing tag with his friends in the streets. He was harassed so often for “fitting the description of a suspect” that his mom, fed up after the last time she sent him out for milk and police stopped him, filled out a scholarship application for a boarding school in Connecticut. When he was accepted, she sent him away at 14. “I didn’t want anyone to take him away from me at that age,” she told me. “Man, those policemen were a pain in my neck, you hear me?”Neutrality is not a stance on racism. There cannot be racists on one side, anti-racists on the other. There is one, and then there is the other. Today, our daughter, now seven, has memorized George Floyd’s name. She knows he was killed by police. She has asked us: “Would police ever hurt a little Black girl?” To which my husband replied: “They might.”My daughter is an empathic child, three years younger than Kondo was when she met the co-pilot of the Enola Gay. She has marched with Black Lives Matter protesters and stared at the remains of the atomic bomb. There is no playbook for what happens to the little girl who realizes that little girls like her can be hated, maimed or murdered for who they are and where they are from. You can shield her from charred tricycles and viral police brutality videos, but one day she will know.When I was a teenager, understanding Hiroshima and the history of racism against Japanese people while simultaneously experiencing prejudice myself awakened my own interest in civil rights, putting me on the path to follow in Hersey’s footsteps and become a journalist.In Hiroshima, Hersey chose his subjects carefully: the widow raising kids, two doctors, a German Jesuit priest, the young woman working to support her parents, and the Rev Kiyoshi Tanimoto. If you read between the lines of the book, Hersey’s subjective choices of who to include, and how to unfurl carefully culled details through his subjects’ eyes, did not just give the book its emotional power. Taken together, these choices laid out a clear point of view against the atomic bomb. Hersey’s son told the New Yorker that the journalist had “a strong sense of right and wrong”, which colored his approach to reporting and writing the story.Hiroshima sparked my interest in reading other books not assigned in classes. By high school, I started with Ronald Takaki’s Strangers From a Different Shore. Monica Sone’s Nisei Daughter. I moved on to read Booker T Washington. WEB DuBois. Malcolm X. I did not know until many years later how some of the same Black voices I grew up reading and thinking about were among the earliest voices to speak out so urgently against the atomic bomb.Martin Luther King called for the abolition of nuclear weapons, linking the idea to racial harmony: “We must transform the dynamics of the world power struggle from the negative nuclear arms race, which no one can win, to a positive contest to harness man’s creative genius for the purpose of making peace.”Setsuko Thurlow was 13 when the bomb hit. “I found myself crushed, pinned under the collapsed buildings,” Thurlow, now 88, recently recalled. “Then I started to hear the whispers of the girls around me. ‘Mother helped me. I am here. God help me.’ So I knew I was not alone in that total darkness. I was surrounded by my classmates.” Thurlow described how she managed to escape the rubble. But about 30 girls who had been in the room with her ended up burning alive. Over the years she came to realize that the atomic bomb was not dropped out of military necessity. Historians, Thurlow said, had uncovered a “racist reason”.One of these historians, Vincent Intondi, in his painstakingly researched 2015 book, African Americans Against the Bomb, laid out how Black leaders placed nuclear disarmament into broader discussions of civil rights, colonialism, militarism, racism, peace and human rights. Writers such as Langston Hughes, as Intondi pointed out, saw the decision to bomb Japan as racially motivated. Hughes asked: “Why did the United States not drop atomic bombs on Italy or Germany?” Meanwhile, DuBois advocated for outlawing atomic energy used for bombs, and connected Japan’s nonwhite victims to the freedom struggle. “If power can be held through atomic bombs,” DuBois wrote, “colonial peoples may never be free.”In 1964, the JapaneseAmerican activist Yuri Kochiyama invited a group of hibakusha to her Harlem apartment. She also invited Malcolm X, who surprised everyone when he showed up and knocked on the door. “You have been scarred by the atom bomb,” he told the Japanese survivors. “You just saw that we have also been scarred. The bomb that hit us was racism.”Eight months later, Malcolm X was gunned down in a ballroom in New York. Kochiyama had developed a friendship with him and was in the ballroom when he was shot. As others fled, she rushed toward him, picking up his head and putting it in her lap, begging him to stay alive.As Ronald Takaki and other historians have documented, President Harry Truman, who gave the thumbs-up to drop the bomb, penned a letter to his future wife, Bess, in 1911, more than three decades before Hiroshima and Nagasaki: “The Lord made a white man of dust, a nigger from mud, then threw up what was left and it came down a Chinaman. He does hate Chinese and Japs. So do I. It is race prejudice I guess. But I am strongly of the opinion that negroes ought to be in Africa, yellow men in Asia, and white men in Europe and America.”Today, the nuclear weapons system is still sanctioned by structures of white supremacy and power, under claims of safety and self-defense. It continues to protect those in power, while nuclear testing harms people of color around the world, contaminating food and water resources and exposing residents to radiation. In the 1960s, France conducted nuclear tests in the Sahara Desert in Algeria, and in French Polynesia until 1996. There has been little to no compensation for victims of those tests. The US also conducted nuclear tests in the South Pacific, to the detriment of impoverished indigenous populations.As Black Lives Matter supporters call to defund militarized police departments that claim to protect citizens while using bloody and deadly violence against them, Kondo, along with other hibakusha, question why the same countries that claim to never want to see another atomic annihilation like in Hiroshima or Nagasaki continue to upgrade and preserve their nuclear weapons. We can live with this kind of middling existence for a long time. But there comes a point where it feels like a lie.From her church in Miki, Kondo talked to me about the strangeness of time, how it all seems to come around full circle. She left atheism years ago to rejoin her father’s Christian faith. As I sat across from her virtually, the blush-colored baby gown she wore through the bombing sat folded on a table beside her. She held up her signed copy of the book Hiroshima, its pages faded from years of exposure to dust and light. She turned to a page depicting her father in those first hours after the bomb, looking for his wife, and the baby they had named Koko.After decades of hiding or staying silent, in recent years more hibakusha have come forward, reclaiming their place in society, becoming proactive and outspoken, a force in the movement to abolish nuclear weapons. They have done so on the heels of hibakusha like the Rev Kiyoshi Tanimoto, one of the earliest survivors among them who dared to disrupt the atmosphere.“My father told me we might not change the whole world,” Kondo told me before we signed off. “But if we tell our story, person to person … someday.”And as I looked at Mr Tanimoto’s daughter’s face, in that moment I could picture the reverend. The man in my literary memory, with his hair parted down the middle, lifting naked, dead bodies out of a stationary boat, saying out loud and into the air: “Please forgive me for taking this boat. I must use it for others, who are alive.”This story, originally published by Narratively, is a collaboration with the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.

It remains unclear what caused the chemical to ignite.Ammonium nitrate is a common industrial chemical used mainly for fertiliser because it is a good source of nitrogen for plants. It is also one of the main components in mining explosives.It is not explosive on its own, rather it is an oxidiser, drawing oxygen to a fire – and therefore making it much more intense, according to Gabriel da Silva, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Melbourne.However, da Silva said, it ignites only under the right circumstances, and these are difficult to achieve. “You need extreme circumstances to set off an explosion,” he said.While ammonium nitrate can in fact put out a fire, if the chemical itself is contaminated, for example with oil, it becomes highly explosive. “I think that’s what’s happened here,” said da Silva.While the chemicals in the air should dissipate fairly quickly, lingering pollutants can cause problems later, for example if they acidify rain.“If you look at the smoke that came from the blast it’s this kind of blood red colour. That’s because of the nitrogen oxide air pollutants in it,” he said.If the 2,700-tonne figure is accurate, that would make the ammonium nitrate explosion larger than the 1947 Texas City Disaster, when a consignment of 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded, killing nearly 500 people. The blast created a 4.5-metre (15ft) tidal wave.The images coming out of Beirut are also horribly reminiscent of the destruction inflicted on the Chinese city of Tianjin by a 2015 warehouse disaster that killed more than 170 people and left hundreds injured.On the night of 12 August a series of cataclysmic detonations rocked an area of warehouses where large quantities of hazardous chemicals, also including sodium cyanide and potassium nitrate, were being stored, in some cases illegally.Chinese authorities later claimed the first explosion had been triggered when the summer heat caused a highly flammable compound called nitrocellulose to spontaneously ignite. Nearby stores of ammonium nitrate then caught fire and exploded in the major port city, which lies 110km (70 miles) south-east of the capital Beijing.Firefighters who rushed to the scene reportedly attempted to extinguish the initial blaze with water – only to inadvertently exacerbate the situation because of the presence of hazardous flammable chemicals. The majority of those killed were firefighters, including at least one teenager.Such was the force of the Tianjin explosions that they registered as small earthquakes.Then, as now, witnesses filmed apocalyptic, almost surreal footage showing the scale of the inferno."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21de47ed085db32b257a7ced29625c03907bae83/0_314_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ced51a4561505c64a0f1be6f23326356","title":"beirut blast what we know so far","story":"An explosion in the port of Lebanon’s capital on Tuesday devastated the city, with a national day of mourning declared for Wednesday"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7a9cb7f75b7d3ec53b86b2042dc14e0981279bd/919_661_4062_2438/master/4062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bc27f4d2e77532d42004e65bd60c18e","title":"englands contact tracers making handful of calls a month","story":"Agents report ringing numbers that don’t exist and occupying time with barbecues and quizzesIt was hailed as a “world-beating” service by prime minister Boris Johnson at its launch, but three months on and contract tracers hired to work on England’s test-and-trace system say they are making only a handful of calls every month and are occupying their time with barbecues and quizzes.Agents told the  they were often calling people who had already been spoken to by another contact tracer, and making calls to numbers that did not exist or that went straight through to voicemail. Employees at Sitel – one of the companies contracted to provide the service – said they were being given quizzes by team leaders to keep them occupied in the day and that prizes were even being offered to those making the highest number of calls to keep up morale. One contact tracer said that in one instance £50 was awarded to the highest ranking caller in each team, who was then put in a draw at the end of the month to win a TV.The details come amid growing frustration among local health officials about the national test-and-trace system, which was launched in May and was seen as vital to easing England out of lockdown. Run by the former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding, it involves more than 20,000 contact tracers, paid around £10 an hour, employed by private firms such as Serco.One contact tracer said they had made just a few calls in two months of work, two of which had been fake numbers. “I’ve heard of tracers claiming to be sat in the garden having a barbecue so that they can stay logged in and clock up the hours,” he added. “They aren’t alone – there’s hundreds, if not thousands, of similar stories.”Another agent said that they were sent daily icebreakers which included questions such as “what’s your favourite flower?”, and that they had to do pub quiz-style questions as a part of the team “to pass the time and keep people active”.He said: “It’s very juvenile, particularly when they treat us with extreme scepticism and negativity when calls aren’t coming in.”Data seen by the  provided by an employee at the company Intelling, hired through outsourcing firm Serco, appears to show the scale of inactivity among employees, with 471 agents making just 135 calls in two days – around 0.14 calls per agent per day. This figure includes calls to incorrect numbers, voicemails, or multiple calls made to the same inidual. One tracer working at the company said that one inidual had been called by tracers 20 times.Serco said they have no record of someone being contacted 20 times and that it was better to have too much capacity in terms of staff than too little.Another tracer for a company contracted through Serco said they had been working for two and a half months and made just four calls, with the last one over a month ago and two that went to voicemail. She said she had seen a spreadsheet showing around 15 calls a day were being made by a team of over 55 people. Some of her colleagues had still not made a single call, she said.“We could easily make 30 calls a day,” said a tracer at Intelling. “I’ve worked hundreds of hours and only made a handful of calls, and all of them have gone to voicemail.” has seen progress reports from another contract tracer working at Sitel, which showed his team was averaging around 10 cases per person over nine weeks. He said that he had done a handful of calls, of which only one had connected and that person had already been contacted.Contract tracers reported that phone calls that had taken place were not being logged properly on the system, due to a lack of training. They said this meant some people were getting called multiple times a day by agents.“From a personal perspective I am a medical student so public health initiatives like track and trace is something I care about and meant something to me,” said one tracer. “I understand the consequences of really good public health initiatives and this was an opportunity to do something powerful and make a huge difference.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “In just eight weeks NHS test and trace has tested over 2.6 million people for coronavirus and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive, in order to break the chain of transmission.“We have over 27,000 contact tracers in place to undertake this vital work and anyone with symptoms should book a test.”When contacted for comment, Sitel merely sent a link to a webpage about the impact of the pandemic on its operations. Intelling did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e866f04bd8707a1d18bb3391f0f39c4c14bea98/0_208_3480_2089/master/3480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f744e4c95db88d053fae2eeb4893e852","title":"sri lanka election vote coronavirus rajapaksa","story":"Rajapaksa expected to dominate elections held five months after president Gotabaya Rajapaksa sacked parliamentary assembly Sri Lankans have begun voting in parliamentary elections twice delayed by the coronavirus, with results expected to further entrench the Rajapaksa family’s dominance of the island’s politics.Voters have been asked to observe social distancing and bring their own pens to the polls – with special booths set up for those who are quarantining – for a contest that will end months of constitutional limbo in Sri Lanka.The country has been without a parliament since president Gotabaya Rajapaksa sacked the assembly in March and then postponed polls scheduled for April citing the Covid-19 outbreak.Rajapaksa dismissed a constitutional article requiring him to summon parliament by early June, and has instead overseen one of the world’s most stringent responses to the pandemic without the input or oversight of the legislative branch.Sri Lanka appears to have contained the virus, recording 2,823 cases including 11 deaths.He has appointed at least seven presidential taskforces to manage the country’s affairs in the meantime, which civil society groups have said are staffed mainly by ex-military and police personnel, some of whom are accused of human rights violations.The Colombo-based Centre for Policy Analysis has warned the lack of oversight or checks and balances “have serious ramifications for a free and open society and liberal democracy”.The Rajapaksa-run SLPP, a Sinhalese-Buddhist nationalist party, is forecast to win a parliamentary majority on Wednesday that would cement the president’s brother Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister with senior roles for another brother, Chamal, and Mahinda’s son Namal.Mahinda Rajapaksa, a charismatic strongman, served two terms as Sri Lanka’s president from 2005. He oversaw the brutal end of the country’s 26-year civil war against Tamil insurgents and was credibly accused of curtailing civil and political freedoms and committing human rights abuses against Tamils and political opponents.The major challenger among a bitterly ided opposition is Sajith Premadasa, who was defeated in November’s presidential contest, and then broke away from the United National party (UNP) to form his own group. A faction of the UNP, led by former prime minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, is also contesting the polls.A win for the SLPP would be another step in a remarkable comeback for the Rajapaksa family, which appeared to have been cast out of the country’s politics when forces from across the Sri Lankan political spectrum united to beat Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2015 presidential elections.It was regarded as a rebirth of Sri Lankan democracy and a repudiation of the family’s authoritarian style of politics, with human rights NGOs returning to Colombo, newspapers freer to criticise authorities and reforms enacted to limit the power of the presidency.But the coalition government that won the 2015 polls quickly stagnated due to disagreements between key figures that culminated in a months-long political crisis three years later.The confusion and ision that followed that stalemate was cited as a key reason why Islamic State-inspired terrorists were able to carry out the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings that killed 269 people.It also smoothed the way for the return of the Rajapaksa family to power, with Gotabaya announcing he would run for president in the days after the attack, on a platform of security and centralising power.The SLPP hopes to win a two-thirds majority in parliament that would allow it to repeal some of the reforms to limit the power of the presidency passed by the previous government.Results are expected to be announced by Thursday afternoon in Colombo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62a7cd26ee7b8426a28804c981ccaa1b7ae8c594/0_166_3796_2278/master/3796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f83848a67ba213214580b92a34663781","title":"us deep south racism poverty fuel coronavirus pandemic","story":"Poor access to healthcare, failed political leadership and the endurance of segregation and generational racism has contributed to a surge in Covid-19 deathsIt was only two years ago that Pamela Rush travelled from Lowndes county, Alabama, to Washington DC to testify in front of a panel of US lawmakers, describing the conditions of crippling poverty and predatory lending in an area still blighted by generations of racial inequality.“They charged me over $114,000 on a mobile home that’s falling apart,” she said. “I got raw sewage. I don’t have no money, I’m poor.”And it was only last month that she died of Covid-19.Her death from the virus, wrote the civil rights and moral movement campaigner the Rev William Barber, was “a death caused by structural poverty”.The same could be said of many deaths in black belt counties in the deep south, where a combination of poor access to healthcare, failed political leadership and the endurance of segregation and generational racism has contributed to a surge in Covid-19 deaths in recent months.As the rain pounded her raised front porch, Sandy Oliver, one of Rush’s best friends from high school, took a moment to reflect on those she had lost to Covid-19. Sitting in her rocking chair, she counted them in her head, gazing to the roof where an old ceiling fan whirred gently. “At least 10,” she said. “All within the last month and a half.”Oliver knew many of the 24 people who have died from the virus here. A few days earlier Rush had been commemorated at a nearby socially-distanced funeral.“I felt terrible because I know it could have been me too,” said Oliver, who recovered from the virus a few weeks earlier. “My heart just goes out for her, and for her two kids.”For many communities in the deep south, the story of death, loss and suffering at the hands of the virus has been borne of the same entrenched issues.Decades ago, during the civil rights movement, the county was referred to as “Bloody Lowndes“ due to its long history of lynchings, white supremacy and KKK activity. In 1965, voting rights marchers led by Martin Luther King Jr and the late John Lewis crossed the county on the way to Montgomery from Selma.Although the Trump administration has pledged federal aid to hospitals treating uninsured patients for Covid-19, the stigma and fear associated with no formal coverage left some here struggling to seek help.When Rickey Lewis, Sandy Oliver’s son-in-law, got the virus, causing pneumonia in both his lungs, delirium and fever, he didn’t call an ambulance but drove himself to the hospital. He has no insurance and worried about ambulance bills. He also knew it could take hours for paramedics to arrive. By the time he made it, he said, he couldn’t walk and had to be carried inside.Lewis spent four days at Vaughan Regional hospital in Selma before being discharged. Although he still had symptoms, he said, he drove himself home to avoid the risk of financial penalty.“I had the faith I would survive,” Lewis said, now recovered. “I had to.”But his wife, Quanita Oliver, felt less confident.At Montgomery city hall, Mayor Steven Reed looked out of his boardroom window and considered the news of the day. His office is a few hundred feet from the state capitol building where governor George Wallace, on 6 March 1965, sanctioned the use of force against peaceful marchers in Selma, and where 19 days later Dr King delivered his How Long, Not Long speech after the march was finally completed.“Maybe it will help to de-escalate some of the political rhetoric around wearing a mask and doing other things that are necessary to win the battle in this pandemic,” said Reed, the city’s first Black mayor.Montgomery found itself at the centre of the mask wearing culture wars in June, after the city council voted down a mask ordinance despite soaring deaths and testimony from hospital doctors urging them to pass legislation. The council, which consists of five white members and four Black members, voted largely on racial lines. Doctors who attended the vote walked out in disgust as the result was announced.Following a national backlash, at the beginning of July the council eventually took another vote and passed the mandate.But the council president, Charles Jinright, a conservative who changed his ballot the second time around, was frank about his motivation for doing so, and spoke openly about his own skepticism that mask wearing had an effect on transmission, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary.“It was public opinion at that point,” he said of what changed his vote. “You get different stories from the White House, different stories from doctors, and then you see stuff that’s online – there’s so much information out there.”Jinright, who is white and has sat on the council for over two decades, conceded that the June city council meeting was the first time he had heard of the racially disproportionate death toll in his city. His district is majority white.Mayor Reed remained diplomatic when he heard of Jinright’s recent realization. “I think people often live in a cocoon of who and what they’re familiar with,” he said. “If you don’t venture out in terms of trying to get more information, it’s very easy to become trapped in the narrative that you find easiest.”Last week governor Ivey extended the statewide mask wearing ordinance.Dr Rachael Fraught found it difficult to hide her exhaustion. One of only two ICU doctors at the Greenwood Leflore hospital, which serves many counties in the rural Mississippi delta region, over the past month she has seen a surge of critical cases that have often left the hospital overwhelmed.She has watched three members of the same family die from the virus. In recent weeks, as the county experienced a second surge in cases following a fresh wave of community spread, the 12 bed Covid-19 unit reached capacity and some patients were transferred out of state.Patients coming in with severe symptoms are disproportionately black.She walked up to a wing, converted from a ward into sleeping quarters for doctors and nurses working overtime, and showed her makeshift bedroom, where she naps and sometimes sleeps the night on a hospital bed.“It’s a rollercoaster of emotion,” Fraught said. “There are times when I feel very prepared and motivated to take care of people because I’m the one who’s trained to do this. But at times you can get a little desperate. Especially when we were having a lot of death.”Dr Fraughtwas frustrated with the fact that Mississippi was one of the first states to reopen after going into lockdown too late. The hospital has become more adept at treating Covid patients by establishing routine, and has seen some success with the use of the antiviral drug remdesivir. But, like many rural hospitals in America, it faces financial uncertainty and still goes through waves of PPE shortages, meaning staff are often forced to reuse masks, gowns and face shields.“This is my hometown,” she said. “And in a lot of ways the care here is personal. I have less than six degrees of separation from everybody that I treat.”Greenwood, on the banks of the Yazoo River and the largest city in the county, has its own rich history from the civil rights era. In 1962 numerous organizations descended on the town to start voter registration drives. In 1966, in front of a crowd of 3,000 people, Stokely Carmichael coined the phrase “Black Power” during a speech here following his arrest during “The March against Fear” from Memphis to Jackson.At the city hall, where his grandparents were once denied the right to vote, Tavaris Cross reflected on that history in the context of the pandemic.“Things have changed but so much has stayed the same.” Cross, an organizer with the Poor People’s Campaign, said. “We still have low salaries, low wages, the worst housing conditions, poor schooling and a healthcare system that needs a lot of work.”A few feet from the city hall stands a confederate monument erected in 1913. Following Mississippi’s recent decision to remove the confederate battle flag from its state flag, the county voted to take the monument down as well. Cross was heartened by the move, but remained cautious of the long term effects on race relations in the city.“It’s a double edged sword, because the reality is our white counterparts are the employers in this community. This statue represents their history and their heritage. And it’s not coming down by choice. It’s coming down by force.”He has worked with Covid survivors in the community, some of whom, like Patrick Ivory, lost their jobs when taking sick leave.Ivory sat out on his neatly mowed lawn and listed his symptoms from last month. A temperature of 104F s and pneumonia on his right lung. “It felt like fire,” he said, describing how his wife Davuchi would place ice on his body only for it to melt instantly.He spent one night in the ICU after his blood oxygen levels plummeted and then returned home with oxygen support. It took two weeks for his symptoms to subside, but by that time his employers at a local hardware store, Home Front, had terminated his job. He was unable to claim unemployment.A manager for the store, Richie Fulgham, declined to comment on Ivory’s sacking.“He did everything right,” said Davuchi. “But after he got sick they didn’t want anything to do with us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6f9f806e667ccb038c390f59f242752ed51b42e/0_641_2447_1468/master/2447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5774fc6c43172c626c556199235c269a","title":"wednesday briefing strife torn lebanon reels from beirut port explosion","story":"Hospitals overwhelmed as president calls for two-week state of emergency … MPs blast Covid border policy … man graduates from university aged 96Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the top stories.A day of both mourning and a massive search, rescue and relief effort has begun in Beirut, Lebanon, in the aftermath of the chemical explosion at a port that killed at least 78 people and caused extensive damage for miles around. Authorities said a huge store of the highly reactive chemical ammonium nitrate ignited and blew up, sending a shockwave across the city, shattering windows, collapsing roofs and destroying homes. We are covering the situation live this morning.Lebanon’s president, Michel Aoun, said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years. He is due to convene an urgent cabinet meeting today and is calling for a two-week state of emergency. The country is grappling with an economic crisis, which has slashed incomes and jobs and led to soaring nationwide poverty, and also rising tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group along Lebanon’s southern border. Boris Johnson confirmed that UK nationals were among those caught up in the aftermath. Staff at the British embassy were accounted for, some having sustained non-life-threatening injuries, he said.Coronavirus latest – Schools should be last to close and first to reopen if there is a second wave of Covid-19, with regular testing for pupils and teachers, the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, has insisted. Pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops should be shut ahead of schools in the case of emergency restrictions, with attendance of children in nurseries and primaries prioritised over secondaries if necessary. The government’s failure to impose special border measures such as mandatory self-isolation in the run-up to lockdown was “a serious mistake”, MPs conclude in a damning report in which they cite evidence suggesting thousands of cases arrived from overseas as a result.Just 36 out of the UK’s 100 biggest companies reduced CEO pay in light of the coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis, according to analysts. FTSE-100 CEOs are now handed, on average, the same as nearly 120 full-time workers and of the 36 companies that did cut CEO pay, measures were “superficial or short-term”.

Beirut governor Marwan Abboud later told a local radio station that more than 100 people remain missing, including several firefighters, the newspaper reports.“Beirut has never gone through what it went through yesterday,” Abboud said.As is common after major disasters, there has been some confusion over the death toll. A named Red Cross official was earlier quoted by local broadcasters saying that the number of fatalities was expected to reach 100. However, it now appears that the number of deaths has passed this grim milestone. Today’s edition of al-Akhbar newspaper, which shows a photo of a destroyed port with the words: The Great Collapse.Residents, desperate to reach their loved ones, are sharing pictures of missing relatives, as well as phone numbers online. On Instagram, a page, locatevictimsbeirut, has also been set up to try to locate people in the aftermath of the blast. Rappler news in the Philippines reports that 12 Filipinos are missing in Beirut.The head of the Lebanese Red Cross, George Kettana, has told Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International that there are over 4,000 people injured, some in a serious condition, and that the number of fatalities may reach 100. Some victims are still trapped under rubble, Kettana said.This has not been confirmed by officials. Rescue teams have worked through the night into Wednesday morning, in the hope of recovering survivors. “There are many people missing. People are asking the emergency department about their loved ones and it is difficult to search at night because there is no electricity,” the health minister Hamad Hasan told Reuters. Officials expect the death toll will rise further. So far, 78 are confirmed to have died. Yesterday, relatives of the missing scrambled at the port for news of their loved ones, AFP reported:“It’s a catastrophe inside. There are corpses on the ground. Ambulances are still lifting the dead,” a soldier at the port said. A woman in her twenties stood screaming at security forces, asking about the fate of her brother, a port employee.“His name is Jad, his eyes are green,” she pleaded, to no avail as officers refused her entry.This image, taken by a drone, shows a destroyed events and exhibition hall near the scene of an explosion.

He said the Cypriot embassy in Beirut, which was closed at the time of the blast, was extensively damaged.“Cyprus is ready to accept injured persons for treatment and send medical teams if required,” Christodoulides told state broadcaster CyBC.Tuesday’s explosion was heard throughout Cyprus, which lies about 100 miles (160km) away. There are reports that six medical workers are among those who were killed in the explosion, though it is not possible to confirm this. Several hospitals were damaged in the blast, with parts of their ceilings collapsing, windows shattered and electricity cut off.Throughout the night, TV and radio presenters in Lebanon read the names of the missing or wounded, reports Sarah El Deeb, Associated Press correspondent. Many residents, desperate to reach family members, are sharing online messages with phone numbers and the names of their relatives. In Beirut, residents are waking up to scenes of devastation this morning. The scale of the disaster is immense. Dr David Caldicott, emergency consultant and senior clinical lecturer in medicine at the Australian National University, has provided the following analysis on the scale of the explosion. Ammonium nitrate is an important fertiliser, but also a key component in improvised explosives around the world. The Oklahoma bombing in 1995 involved 3-4 tonnes of the material, and it has been alleged that as much as 2,600 tonnes has been involved in Beirut’s case. Following the Oklahoma bombing, federal restrictions in the US were introduced. Our research group computer modelled the possible effects of merely a 5 tonne ammonium nitratefuel oil (ANFO) device on the Adelaide CBD in the mid-‘00s, and the results were several 100 dead and 1000s injured. Shortly after, more stringent accounting of an agent the clearly still has utility in agriculture was introduced in Australia.This explosion can be considered as a ‘high order’ explosion, with an obvious blast wave seen to be propagated from a massive secondary explosion, that followed on from the event. This has significant implications for the number and types of casualties that might be expected.My colleague Ben Doherty, has the following update:The full scale of the calamity was laid bare when the capital woke on Wednesday with rescue teams searching through the debris of ruined neighbourhoods for the missing, and hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of casualtiesA two-week state of emergency has been recommended by the president, after authorities blamed a huge store of the highly reactive chemical ammonium nitrate for the explosion that sent a shockwave across the city, shattering windows, collapsing roofs and rendering homes uninhabitable.The blast, at 6:08pm local time on Tuesday, was so powerful it was felt in Cyprus, 120 miles away.It left cars with blown out windows strewn on highways and a city in shock. Footage posted on social media showed whole neighbourhoods in ruins.“There are many people missing. People are asking the emergency department about their loved ones and it is difficult to search at night because there is no electricity,” Health Minister Hamad Hasan told Reuters.President Michel Aoun declared a three-day mourning period, and said the government would release 100 billion lira (£50.5m $66m) of emergency funds.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has tweeted that he is “shocked and saddened” by the explosion in Beirut, adding: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families and the injured.”In the video below, Beirut residents describe the impact of the explosion. “I’ve seen war, I’ve felt war,” says one man. “It’s a catastrophe.

Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

File photograph: The The Government is to launch a study into a proposal to build a €15 billion high-speed train line from Belfast to Dublin and on to Cork and Limerick, the Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has said.The study would be “the most significant” review of the intercity network on the island since the strategic rail review in 2003, and would examine how it could operate with the existing broader network.Mr Ryan said the Department of Transport would shortly launch “a significant procurement process” of about 500km of high-speed line from Belfast-Dublin-CorkLimerick.On Tuesday a spokesman for the department said that on foot of commitments in the Government’s national planning framework and national development plan, as well as under the New Decade, New Approach agreement made by the Irish and British governments to support the full restoration of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, it was proposed to conduct a study of rail speeds along the Belfast-Dublin-CorkLimerick core corridor. The new study would “take a strategic view on the potential of high-higher speed rail to support the relevant national strategic outcomes of the National Planning Framework through developing high-level design and operational proposals” for the Belfast-Dublin-CorkLimerick corridor, said the spokesman.The Department of Transport said the study would consider including conventional rail, higher and high speed rail links along the route.The spokesman for the department said that a procurement competition would be launched in the next few weeks, and that work on the study should commence by November.Feasibility studyThe Department of Transport said in response that it was not aware of any official feasibility study in relation to the development of a rail line from Dublin to Derry via Navan and Letterkenny. “Therefore any estimates given are highly speculative and must be treated with extreme caution. In addition the costs below are purely related to construction costs only, and do not include the annual costs that would arise each and every year in relation to maintenance and renewal of the line and the operation of actual services on the line, both of which would require extensive Exchequer support. “Based on an indicative range of €25 million to €30 million per kilometre and a distance of approximately 500km it is estimated that a Dublin to Derry rail link via Navan and Letterkenny could cost between €12 billion to €15 billion approximately. The final costs may include items beyond simple laying of track (such as compulsory purchase of land).”Last December the former minister for transport Shane Ross said a review would be undertaken this year into the feasibility of reopening a rail line between Dublin and Navan. Separately, official documents show that details about the cost of a potential rail line from Dublin to Derry via Navan and Letterkenny were sought as part of the recent talks on the formation of the new government.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4322128.1596573492!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hume brought to derry as candles in windows light his way","story":"Though restricted through Covid-19 the people of Derry pay tribute to John Hume through candles and condolences.

In the doors and windows, candles were burning to light his way.Due to the coronavirus pandemic the Hume family had asked that, rather than line the streets as the cortege passed, people should light a candle for peace either in their home or at their door.When the hearse arrived at St Eugene’s Cathedral a socially distanced guard of honour lined the path from the gate to the door as Mr Hume’s coffin was brought inside. Those in the guard of honour also held candles in memory of Mr Hume, who died on Monday morning aged 83.The wicker coffin was received by the Bishop of Derry Dr Donal McKeown. The extended Hume family, including the Nobel Laureate’s wife Pat, wore masks as they entered the cathedral.A short time earlier in Co Donegal, several hundred people gathered near the Hume home outside Moville to pay their respects to the former SDLP leader.As the cortege emerged onto the main road those watching began to applaud. “We’re sorry. He was a great man,” one bystander shouted as the hearse passed.The clapping continued, the sound rippling along the road as the procession made its way slowly towards Moville, and then to the Border and into Derry City.“He was one of the most exceptional figures in Irish history, and we wanted to make sure we were here this evening to pay our respects,” said Ellen Barr. “We all have so much to thank John Hume for.”“He made this his home, and he was part of this community,” said Brian McDermott. “He needed to be given his proper send-off.”Among those who had gathered to pay their respects were the mayor of Donegal, Rena Donaghey, and Fianna Fáil TD and minister of state Charlie McConalogue. “John was a Derry man through and through but he was also as close to a Donegal man as you can get,” said Mr McConalogue.Because of coronavirus around just 120 people will be allowed into the cathedral for the funeral Mass on Wednesday morning, most of them family and close friends.Mayor of Derry Brian Tierney urged people to follow the wishes of the Hume family by watching or listening to the funeral service on television, radio and live stream."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4322133.1596573739!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pubs to stay closed until september at least as restrictions tightened significantly","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMulligan\u0027s pub owner Gary Cusack at work in the Poolbeg Street bar today ahead of the Government announcement on phase-four reopening. But the Coalition decided to delay the already-paused opening up of society for a further three weeks. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs will remain closed until September at least, the Cabinet has decided, in a significant tightening of societal restrictions to curb the recent increase of Covid-19 cases in Ireland.In a blow to the licensing industry, the Government yesterday decided to delay the already-paused phase four of reopening society for a further three weeks.Besides pubs remaining shut until at least September 1st, the current strict limits of 50 on numbers congregating indoors, and 200 outdoors, will remain in place, a move that disappointed many sporting bodies and wedding venues. The numbers had been due to increase to 100 indoors and 500 outdoors.In a press conference following the Government meeting, Taoiseach Micheál Martin also announced face masks will become mandatory in all shops and retail centres from Monday, and pubs serving food and restaurants will be required to close at 11pm.Separately, the Cabinet also decided to remove five states or territories from the “green list” of 15 from which passengers arriving into Ireland would not need to quarantine. They are Malta, Cyprus, San Marino, Gibraltar and Monaco.The decision to keep all restrictions in place came as a surprise.Increase in casesMr Martin justified the decision in light of recent coronavirus figures which have seen the 14-day incidence of cases triple in the last month.“I know that this will come as a blow to pub owners and I want them to know that I have enormous sympathy for their plight.“This virus is taking away their ability to earn a living.”He continued: “International evidence shows very clearly that pubs and nightclubs reopening too early leads directly and inextricably to increased community transmission. \u0026nbsp“And that is the very worst thing that could happen here. It would be very damaging for our economy in the longer term, it would be very damaging for our plan to reopen schools safely and it would of course be very damaging for our public health.”Vintners’ representatives responded angrily to the decision saying the Government had abandoned the 3,500 smaller pubs across Ireland now facing a “full-blown crisis”.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said Ireland had lost some ground in its battle with coronavirus. “The truth is the pandemic is blazing around the world. In fact it is worse than ever,” he said.“Even in Europe the number of new cases is rising again,” he said, though he said it was largely under control in the EU.The decision to retrench the current phase of lockdown came after a further 45 confirmed cases was confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Tuesday.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the average number of cases had increased in 14 of the 15 “green list” territories and countries over the past two weeks.Ireland had moved from 20 new cases to 53 new cases per day. Two weeks ago there were 120 new cases, last week 284, he said.“NPHET’s view is the situation is ‘finely balanced’ and it would not take much for these cases and new clusters to spill into community transmission,” said Mr Donnelly.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Three men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty Images Britons have rushed for the exits of Brexit Britain, a new study suggests, sparking a brain drain on a scale last seen during the 2004 EU accession of central and eastern European countries – but in the opposite direction. The joint research report, by Berlin’s Social Science Centre and the University of Oxford’s new Berlin outpost, shows that post-Brexit immigrants in Germany are prepared to accept higher risk and even lower pay and conditions to start a new life outside the UK.Outward migration from the UK to EU neighbours has jumped 30 per cent in the last four years, to around 17,000 people annually, with about half attributable to what researchers term the “collective uncertainty” Brexit vote.That uncertainty is visible, too, in naturalisation applications. Compared with pre-Brexit figures, UK citizen applications for another EU passport have jumped 500 per cent – and 2,000 per cent for Germany.“We’re observing a new social migration phenomena and a redefining of what it means to be British-European,” said Daniel Tetlow, a co-author of the study. “In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians.”During the same period migration among other EU member states showed no comparable spikes and, in many cases, stagnated.As well as migration data, researchers Daniel Tetlow and Dr Daniel Auer conducted 46 qualitative, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with British migrants across Germany – a popular destination for a erse cohort of UK emigrants in the last decades.The interviews, covering arrivals from 2007 to 2019, showed a clear ide between pre- and post-Brexit arrivals. Two-thirds of the latter group were prepared to accept a pay cut, or a pay freeze as part of their UK escape plan. They were also significantly greater risk-takers than earlier arrivals: a 40-something male IT consultant said he was still hunting for work in Germany but that “the advantages still outweigh the uncertainty that Brexit brought on my family”.Brexit pushA third of the post-Brexit arrivals conceded they would not have moved had the UK voted to remain in the EU in June 2016. Within 12 weeks of that vote, half of them had departed the UK, compared to the 12 months a majority of pre-Brexit arrivals spent planning their move.“The referendum happened in 2016 – and we immediately changed our minds about buying a house in Bristol,” said one interviewee, a 40-something male academic. “Our whole emigration decision hung on the referendum result.”One-third of the recent group said Brexit had caused direct mental health problems or depression and, in what researchers called an “irony” of Brexit, new arrivals expressed a greater determination to integrate into German society, in particular by learning German, than in the past.A 30-something female translator who arrived in 2015 said, in her subjective experience, many UK citizens in Germany “do not recognise Britain any longer, and feel ashamed to call themselves British, drawing instead on regional and local identities like Scottish, Welsh, Lancastrian, from Yorkshire.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Gil Cohen-MagenAFP via Getty ImagesAs countries around the world anxiously consider how to reopen schools, Israel, one of the first to do so, illustrates the dangers of moving too precipitously.Confident it had beaten the coronavirus and desperate to reboot a devastated economy, the Israeli government invited the entire student body back in late May. Within days, infections were reported at a Jerusalem high school, which quickly mushroomed into the largest outbreak in a single school in Israel, possibly the world.The virus rippled out to the students’ homes and then to other schools and neighbourhoods, ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers and relatives. Other outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close.Across the country, tens of thousands of students and teachers were quarantined. Israel’s advice for other countries? “They definitely should not do what we have done,” said Eli Waxman, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and chairman of the team advising Israel’s National Security Council on the pandemic. “It was a major failure.”The lesson, experts say, is that even communities that have got the spread of the virus under control need to take strict precautions when reopening schools. Smaller classes, mask wearing, keeping desks two metres apart and providing adequate ventilation, they say, are likely to be crucial until a vaccine is available.“If there is a low number of cases, there is an illusion that the disease is over,” said Dr Hagai Levine, a professor of epidemiology and chairman of the Israeli Association of Public Health Physicians. “But it’s a complete illusion.”“The mistake in Israel,” he said, “is that you can open the education system, but you have to do it gradually, with certain limits, and you have to do it in a very careful way.”The United States and other countries are facing similar pressures to fully reopen schools, and President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold funding for districts that don’t reopen. But the US is in a far worse position than Israel was in May: Israel had fewer than 100 new infections a day then. The US is now averaging more than 60,000 new cases a day, and some states continue to set alarming records.‘Jobs, jobs, jobs’Israel’s handling of the pandemic was considered successful at first. The country of nine million quickly closed its borders, shuttered schools in mid-March and introduced remote learning for its two million students. In April, Passover and Ramadan were celebrated under lockdown.By early May, infection rates had fallen from over 750 confirmed cases a day to double digits. The youngest pupils, and older students taking final exams, returned in small groups, splitting the week to take turns using classrooms.Emboldened by the dropping infection rates, the government completely reopened schools on May 17th, the day a new government was sworn in. In his inaugural speech, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu promised a new budget that would deliver three things: “Jobs, jobs, jobs.” His new education minister, Yoav Gallant, said the school system’s “immediate mission” was to allow parents to return to work with peace of mind.Inna Zaltsman, an education ministry official, said administrators also wanted “to return the children to routine as much as possible, for their emotional and pedagogic well-being”. Shopping malls, outdoor markets and gyms had already reopened, and soon houses of worship, restaurants, bars, hotels and wedding halls did too. Netanyahu told Israelis to grab a beer and, while taking precautions, “Go out and have a good time.”In hindsight, that advice was wildly premature. That same day, a mother phoned a teacher at Jerusalem’s Gymnasia Ha’ivrit high school. Her son, a seventh-grade student there, had tested positive for the virus. By the next day, the school confirmed another case in the ninth grade.Ultimately, Israeli officials said, 154 students and 26 staff members were found to be infected. “There was a general euphoria among the public, a sense that we had dealt with the first wave well and that it was behind us,” said Danniel Leibovitch, Gymnasia’s principal. “Of course, that wasn’t true.”The education ministry had issued safety instructions: Masks were to be worn by students in fourth grade and higher, windows kept open, hands washed frequently and students kept two metres apart whenever possible.But in many Israeli schools, where up to 38 children squeeze into classrooms of about 45 sq m, physical distancing proved impossible. Unable to comply with the rules, some local authorities ignored them or simply decided not to reopen at full capacity.Then a heat wave hit. Parents complained that it was inhumane to make children wear masks in steaming classrooms where open windows nullified the air conditioning. In response, the government exempted everyone from wearing masks for four days, and schools shut the windows.That decision proved disastrous, experts say. “Instead of cancelling school in those days, they just told the kids ‘okay, well you have to stay in the class with the air conditioning on and take your masks off’, so you have no ventilation really,” said Dr Ronit Calderon-Margalit, a professor of epidemiology at Hebrew University-Hadassah Braun School of Public Health. “You have the ideal circumstances for an outbreak.”Petri dishThe Gymnasia became a petri dish for Covid-19. When the first case was discovered, the student’s classmates, teachers and other contacts were quarantined. After the second case, which was not directly linked to the first, the school was closed and everyone was instructed to quarantine for two weeks. All students and staff were tested, often waiting in line for hours.About 60 per cent of infected students were asymptomatic. Teachers suffered the most and a few were hospitalised, the principal said. Parents were furious. Oz Arbel told Israel’s Army Radio that for a school project, his daughter’s classmates sat at a table and passed around a mobile phone with a teacher who was showing symptoms. His daughter and wife became infected.One Gymnasia student, Ofek Amzaleg, told Kan public radio that a teacher who coughed in class and joked that he didn’t have coronavirus was among those who tested positive. Ofek also became infected. Leibovitch, the principal, said he had no knowledge of any teacher coming in with symptoms.Seeking to contain the contagion, the education ministry vowed to shut any school with even one Covid-19 case. It ultimately closed more than 240 schools and quarantined more than 22,520 teachers and students.When the school year ended in late June, the ministry said, 977 pupils and teachers had contracted Covid-19. But the health ministry, lacking the necessary infrastructure and resources, did not make contact tracing a priority. In the Gymnasia case, Waxman said, nobody even identified which buses the students had taken to school.Proms were cancelled, but graduating seniors in the central city of Ra’anana held an underground prom party anyway. Dozens contracted the virus. A nursery schoolteacher, Shalva Zalfreund (64), sent a note to parents saying she believed she had been infected in her school, where some parents had sent their children from homes with cases of the virus. She died in July.Outside school walls, the coronavirus returned with a vengeance. Covid wards that had closed with festive ceremonies in late April began filling again, with confirmed infections spiralling to about 800 a day by late June and over 2,000 a day by late July.Some blamed the hasty school reopening as a major factor in the second wave. Siegal Sadetzki, who resigned in frustration last month as Israel’s director of public health services, wrote that insufficient safety precautions in schools, as well as large gatherings like weddings, fuelled a “significant portion” of second-wave infections.But others said singling out schools was unfair when the real problem was that everything reopened too quickly. “The single super-spreader event in the Gymnasia just happened to be in a school,” said Dr Ran Balicer, an Israeli health care official and adviser to the prime minister on the pandemic. “It could have happened in any other setting.”Coronavirus czarNow Israel is confronting the same questions as other countries, trying to learn from its mistakes in planning for the school year that begins September 1st.Public health experts worldwide have coalesced around a set of guidelines for reopening schools. A major recommendation is to create groups of 10 to 15 students who stay together in classrooms, at recess and lunchtime, with teachers assigned to only one group. Each group has minimal contact with other groups, limiting any spread of infection. And if a case of Covid-19 emerges, one group can be quarantined at home while others can continue at school.Other key recommendations include staggering schedules or teaching older students online, keeping desks several feet apart, sanitising classrooms more frequently, providing ventilation and opening windows if possible, and requiring masks for staff and students old enough to wear them properly.On Sunday, the government approved plans for returning only grades 2 and lower (aged about 6 to 7) to school in full-size classes in the fall. Younger children are less likely to become seriously ill, and there is growing evidence that they are less likely than adults and teenagers to transmit the virus to others.The plans also call for splitting older students into capsules of 18 and for mostly online instruction for grades 5 (older primary school) and above. Principals will have the flexibility to adjust their school’s policies based on local conditions. Even those measures may not be enough. Menashe Levy, president of the Israeli High School Principals Association, arranged desks two metres apart in a standard classroom. It could accommodate 14 students, not 18.Israel is plunging ahead. Only one option has been ruled out: closing the schools. “This is a long-term pandemic,” said Dr Nadav Davidovitch, a pandemic policy adviser to the government. “We cannot close schools for a year.” – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318845.1596206285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk outlines brexit talks timetable running into october","story":"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue discussing a free trade deal until October 2nd, British chief negotiator David Frost said on Friday.“Negotiating rounds will take place in August and in September, unless agreed otherwise between the parties,” according to a document Mr Frost posted on Twitter.A fifth round of Brexit talks between ended last week with both sides saying they were still far from reaching an agreement.

The UK recorded 670 new cases today and more than 305,000 cases in total, as well as more than 46,000 deaths, by comparison.Also today, Spain reported 1,178 new coronavirus infections in the past day, mainly in the regions of Madrid and Aragon, and the death toll rose to 28,498.The next instalment of Geoff Dyer\u0027s A-Z of travel is a festival that has no merchandise and no rubbish.

Everything! Read his full account to learn more.Black Rock City, at a festival like no otherNearly three million jobs in the UK - and 197 million worldwide in the tourism sector - look set to be lost due to the collapse of travel, according to the World Travel \u0026amp Tourism Council (WTTC).WTTC economic modelling conducted less than two months ago predicted this ‘worst case scenario’ would occur if barriers to global travel, such as quarantine measures and blanket travel restrictions were to remain in place. While some travel bans have been removed, many others remain, with new restrictions likely to come into force.The group estimates that the UK now looks close to losing a staggering $186 billion (£142bn) from the sector’s contribution to our GDP, equating to a 73 per cent drop compared with 2019.It’s heartbreaking to see our worst fears coming true. The jobs and livelihoods of millions of people who work throughout the sector are disappearing by the day, despite our warning this could happen.However, we still have time to turn this around if we act together now as one and replace ineffective quarantines with comprehensive rapid testing, a worldwide accepted standard of contact tracing and widespread face mask usage. Employing the latest technology, combined with mass adoption of protective face coverings, will help restore confidence to the traveller.Ireland might have to consider reopening pubs on a county by county basis, according to Mike Ryan, executive director with the World Health Organisation.Owners (and customers) of pubs across Ireland are currently waiting for the outcome this evening of a cabinet meeting about returning to business on August 10, a move which had already been delayed amid concerns over the spread of the virus. The move relates to pubs that do not serve food.“You can use a much more localised strategy – by county, by province, whatever it is in the Irish context – but to do that you need very localised data and a localised response capacity.” Parisian city authorities want to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in certain outdoor areas in order to prevent a new spike of coronavirus infections, Le Monde has reported.The paper said that mayor Anne Hidalgo would put in a formal request with the Paris prefecture about ordering the use of face coverings in specific areas, after the Government on Friday gave local authorities the power to order the wearing of masks in outdoor public spaces.Oui or non?Would this be a deal-breaker for you?

Here\u0027s the view today from the historic city of Ston.Tourists walking the walls of StonThe 15th-century wall is 5.5km in length and is one of the world\u0026#39s longest preserved fortification systemsRead more: Dubrovnik without the crowds? 10 reasons why Croatia should be your next holidayThe hotel quarantine system has come under renewed scrutiny, as have government employment policies, reports Giovanni Torre in Perth:Stories emerged from whistleblowers of little to no training at the hotels, inadequate protective equipment, inadequate staffing levels, and sub-contractors being allowed to work across multiple sites.There was at least one allegation that a security guard slept with one of the quarantine residents.A returned traveller who spent two weeks in quarantine in April told The Australian that at the hotel mental health workers were called in to sedate guests who were “screaming” and “begging to be let out and running for the doors”.He said the guards appeared unprepared to control guests desperate to be released.Read the full report here. No fresh air and £27,000 fines: Inside Australia\u0027s strict (but luxurious) 14-day hotel quarantineA sizeable majority of Canadians would support, or somewhat support, returning to lockdown in the event of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in their country, according to a new poll.The survey, conducted for The Globe and Mail by Nanos Research and published today, recorded that more than seven in 10 respondents indicated some level of support for shutting down most businesses and implementing self-isolation.“Even with the economic uncertainty, Canadians are quite receptive to a shutdown of the economy again if there was a resurgence,” Nik Nanos, who oversaw the polling, told the newspaper.“It’s pretty clear that Canadians understand that even though we may be doing okay, this is not over.”One in four Canadians expressed some degree of opposition.It might just be. The remote island of Alonissos is not on many radars, writes Heidi Fuller Love,  and thank goodness for that:At Kyra-Panagia we anchor in a deserted cove and wade ashore to visit the gaily-painted 16th-century monastery and its attendant church, and then wander in the courtyard where tombs dating back to the sixth century were recently discovered.Later, anchored off the tiny, uninhabited island of Peristera the captain tells us about the Mediterranean’s first underwater museum some 30 meters beneath our blue-painted hull, which opened last month.Read her full story here.Virgin Atlantic could run out of money by the end of September if creditors do not approve a £1.2 billion bailout package, a court has heard.PA has the details: Without a restructuring and injection of new cash, it is projected that the airline\u0027s cash flow would drop to critical levels by the middle of next month and it will run out of money altogether by the week beginning September 28.The airline unveiled a restructuring plan to secure its future, involving only private funds, last month.The proposal needs to secure approval from creditors under a court-sanction process.At a High Court hearing on Tuesday, David Allison QC, for Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, told Mr Justice Trower that the Virgin Atlantic Group has a fundamentally sound business model which was not in any problems at all before the Covid-19 pandemic.Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, referred to as the company in written submissions, forms part of the Virgin Atlantic Group, which was referred to as the group.In written submissions to the court, Mr Allison said: The group\u0027s financial position has been severely affected by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which has caused unprecedented disruption to the global aviation industry.Passenger demand has plummeted to a level that would, until recently, have been unthinkable.He said: As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the group is now undergoing a liquidity crisis.Absent a restructuring and an injection of new money, it is projected that the group\u0027s cash flow would drop to a critical level by the week commencing 21 September 2020.US regulators have outlined a path for Boeing’s beleaguered 737 Max to return to the skies, demanding a series of key changes to the passenger jet that will make it fit for service.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said that alterations to the plane’s wiring, flight control software, display software and procedures for flight crew would be needed for the 737 Max to be ready.The plane has been grounded for more than a year after two fatal crashes, plunging Boeing into crisis and dragging on airline companies that had invested heavily in upgrading their fleets.The FAA said its proposals would be subject to a 45-day public consultation period in a major step towards the 737 Max being approved to fly again.However, training requirements and work to refit the planes mean it is unclear if the plane will return to commercial use before the end of this year. International regulators are also assessing the next steps to return it to service.The proposed adjustments to the flight software are intended to stop a feature known as MCAS, which can tip the plane’s nose downward, from mistakenly activating. Read the full story. August is upon us, meaning it is ‘now or never’ when it comes to booking that last-minute summer holiday. So where should you go?if you do decide to head abroad, we recommend you first read this checklist of considerations, drawn up by our travel consumer expert Nick Trend.Convinced? Then here are Greg Dickinson\u0027s best options for a last-minute getaway.Greece is on the listEasyJet has announced it will be returning more of its fleet to service than previously planned this summer thanks to stronger bookings than anticipated.Even in the face of ongoing travel restrictions, the budget carrier said late-season sales were “performing well” and that it will fly 40 per cent of its capacity for the rest of the summer, as opposed to its earlier target of 30 per cent.The airline\u0027s key competitors are also posting promising figures. Ryanair, currently flying at about 40 per cent of standard capacity, says it plans to increase this to 60 per cent in August. In July, it flew with a 72 per cent load factor. Wizz Air, the first European airline to recommence flying back in May, is at 70 per cent, and aims to be at 80 per cent of pre-pandemic passenger numbers by the end of the year.BA, meanwhile has retired its once-daily, all-business-class route between London City and New York after nearly 20 years of service. The offering, which flew 32 seats aboard an Airbus A318 aircraft, operated under the iconic BA001 and BA002 flight numbers that were previously used by Concorde.Aid agencies warned on Monday that the island nations were scrambling to adapt storm shelters to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and stock up on supplies, with thousands of people already evacuating their homes as the hurricane season gets underway. Hurricane Isaias hit the Caribbean over the weekend, killing two people. A busier than normal Atlantic Ocean hurricane season has been predicted for 2020, and the coronavirus could spread easily in crowded emergency shelters where social distancing would be difficult, said Unicef, the United Nations\u0027 children\u0027s agency.In the coming days and weeks, children and families will be at risk of being hit simultaneously by two disasters, COVID-19 and hurricanes, said Bernt Aasen, Unicef\u0027s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean.This is the perfect storm we fear for the Caribbean and Central America, he said in a statement.Storm Isaias has already battered Santo Domingo in the Dominican RepublicSpace tourism could become a reality as early as 2021, with Sir Richard Branson acting as a guinea pig passenger, according to Virgin Galactic.The company, founded by Sir Branson, said on Monday that it “expects to advance to the next phase of its test flight program this autumn with two manned flights.Assuming both flights demonstrate the expected results, Virgin Galactic anticipates Sir Richard Branson\u0027s flight to occur in the first quarter of 2021, the company said in a statement.Virgin Galactic has pushed back the suggested date it will transport the first tourists outside earth’s atmosphere several times.Yet the demand for its proposed service is clear: the company said 600 people have paid $250,000 (£191,400) to book a seat.Emma Featherstone has the full story.A Harry Potter-inspired walking tour in London has been announced as the best travel experience in the UK, according to Tripadvisor and Viator users. The Traveller’s Choice Awards highlight the world’s top tours and activities, based on the opinions logged on the travel reviews website and booking platform. Winners were determined using an algorithm founded on reviews and ratings for bookable experiences over a 12-month period.The Harry Potter tour explores real-life locations that inspired fictional sets including the Leaky Cauldron pub, Diagon Alley and the Ministry of Magic. The two-hour trip, which costs from £18.36 per person, also takes in London landmarks that featured in the film adaptations of the books, such as Millennium Bridge and St Paul’s Cathedral. A good choice for a socially distanced outing, the open-air tour promises small group sizes to ensure a “personalised experience”.Meanwhile, a Dubai desert barbecue and camel ride experience claimed the number one spot worldwide. The all-day trip also includes sand-boarding and costs from £53 per person. Only 71 per cent of Brits, Americans and other English speakers around the globe followed guidelines set by their governments during the Covid-19 lockdown, according to a new study from Durham University Business School.This was drastically lower than French and Italians – where 89 per cent of respondents followed guidelines.The research was conducted at the end of April 2020, the height of the global pandemic, when many countries were at the strictest stage of their lockdowns.Comment: If masks are normalised, we all become subservientRussia has reported 5,159 new cases of the coronavirus, pushing its national tally to 861,423, the fourth largest in the world.Poland has reported its fourth record daily increase in coronavirus cases in a week,  with 680 new infections and six deaths. It comes as the country considers introducing stricter restrictions, including mandatory testing for travellers returning to Poland and quarantine for those coming from certain countries.Mainland China, meanwhile, announced 36 new cases across the country, down from 43 the previous day. No new deaths were registered , leaving China\u0027s total at 4,634 among 84,634 cases reported since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.UK-based P\u0026ampO Cruises has confirmed that it plans to take delivery of its new ship, Iona, before the autumn, reports Ben Parker. It\u0027s some good cheer for cruise fans, given the disappointment many will have felt given the events of the last few days.Iona will be the largest cruise ship ever built for the UK market, at 185,000 tonnes, 345m in length with 17 guest decks. The vessel will also be the first British cruise ship to be powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG). Iona\u0027s yet unnamed sister ship is expected to be delivered in December 2022.An artist\u0026#39s impression of IonaPaul Ludlow, president of P\u0026ampO Cruises, said “Whilst our operations as currently paused, we are delighted that we have more clarity on the arrival of these two new ships. The final outfitting of Iona is almost complete and is looking stunning and we will take delivery of her before the autumn. We also now know that her sister ship will join the fleet at the end of 2022.“Both ships are eagerly anticipated by our guests and we are seeing strong demand for the future. The space on these two ships will allow for extraordinary experiences visual entertainment displays new dining concepts and many new areas for relaxation and indulgence.”... so says Teresa Machan, who laments the loss of cruise this year:Say what you like about cruising – and many have over the past four months – but children love it. Why wouldn\u0027t they? Modern, family-friendly ships are like mini adventure parks but without the queues and poor food. In the current climate, certainly there are places where large ships clearly should not be. But is a family of four cruising from Southampton worse than four or more people boarding a plane and driving around in a car for a week or two?Read her full comment here.While many Unesco heritage sites around the world are slowly reopening, Australia has taken the decision to close the national park that is home to the sacred site of Uluru. The news comes after members of the local Aboriginal community blocked the main entrance to the park, fearing virus-carrying visitors would flock to see the monolith sometimes known as Ayers Rock. The protest started when a flight from Brisbane, considered a Covid-19 hotspot, landed at Ayers Rock airport on Saturday with 42 tourists on board. A number of flights to the area have since been cancelled. Thalia Bohl-Van Den Boogaard, the representative of a group of Indigenous Australians protesting against visitors, told Reuters: “It’s up to tourists to stay away if they come from hotspots or are sick.”She added: “People here have been locked in their communities for months and months to contain the spread, and now it’s not up to them to do the right thing.”Around 350 tourists have visited the park since state borders reopened in July.Closed to visitorsThe Philippines has reinstated a stricter lockdown on its capital, Manila, from today after warnings from medical groups over the weekend that hospitals are losing the battle against the coronavirus.Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president, apologised as the number of Covid-19 cases breached 100,000 and he reintroduced a “modified enhanced community quarantine” that will restrict the operations of non-essential businesses and only allow people to leave home for work or to buy food. We\u0027re doing our very best. Sorry, Manila, said Mr Duterte during a televised broadcast late on Sunday evening. The 103,185 case count and 2,059 death toll is second only to Indonesia in Southeast Asia, despite bringing the economy to its knees by previously imposing one of the longest and strictest quarantine periods in the world, from March 15 to June 1. Empty check-in counters in Manila today as domestic flights were cancelledIt\u0027s the question on many lips at the moment: how is the FCO making decisions about which countries aren\u0027t safe to visit at the moment?Analysis by the , carried out in the wake of Portugal’s second exclusion from the Foreign Office’s ‘safe’ list, found that the country had lower Covid-19 rates than many “green” countries Britons were allowed to visit.Likewise, Spain was frustrated when the travel ban was extended to cover its popular islands, despite the likes of Majorca and Ibiza having low infection rates. Hugh Morris asked an expert how they would manage the situation if were they in the hot seat.Here\u0027s what Lloyd Figgins, a former soldier turned travel risk advisor, had to say:In the case of Spain, you have to look at data from the entire country. Domestic tourism had been open for a while before Spain accepted international tourists. In regions such as Aragon, the infection rate has risen by more than 200 per cent in two weeks and invariably residents of these badly infected areas have travelled to other regions of Spain, including the Canary and Balearic Islands. Travel decisions need to be based on sound risk management facts and by understanding who might be harmed and how. Making decisions based on commercial or emotional requirements simply don’t work in a time of crisis. They are ineffectual and cloud the facts.Read his full verdict here.The bosses of Britain’s biggest independent travel agent called on Boris Johnson to save summer by restarting flights to the Spanish islands as they cut up to a fifth of their 4,500-strong workforce, reports Oliver Gill.Hays Travel owners John and Irene Hays said some of the 878 jobs at risk could be saved if the Government introduces “regional travel corridors” to the Spanish islands. The firm is being forced into sweeping cutbacks after ministers re-imposed a blanket quarantine on arrivals from Spain on July 25, dealing a brutal blow to the industry on the first weekend of the summer school holiday season.The decision sent sales back to where they were at the start of lockdown when demand had totally collapsed, Ms Hays said. Coupled with a gradual tapering off of the taxpayer-funded furlough scheme, it left Hays with no alternative to cuts:When Spain was cancelled down at such short notice it had an impact on customer confidence more widely. People who were just beginning to get their confidence back … that situation changed overnight. It took us back to where we were in April.Read the full report here.By the end of the year, the iconic Hollywood establishment will be even harder to get into,  reports Eilidh Hargreaves. Approved members will be granted access to a private dining area, a personal butler and the freedom to leave their belongings and come and go during extended stays, according to a statement from the hotel.

So why on earth hasn\u0027t he set foot in Athens, the country’s iconic capital? He writes:I’m a history buff. On holiday, often to my wife’s irritation, I seek out relics of the past with the same relish that most people my age search for “Instagrammable” cocktail bars.

People were screaming and running, bleeding, said a Reuters witness. Balconies were blown off buildings. Glass in high-rise buildings shattered and fell to the street.Video was shared online of the moment an enormous explosion erupted near the Beirut waterfront, sending an immense shockwave tearing through downtown neighbourhoods.Moments before, a fire could be seen burning at the base of a billowing grey tower of smoke, apparently from an initial explosion near the port area. The major blast was preceded by a smaller one 10 minutes earlier in the same port area of the city (see the map below).Local media showed images of bloodied people trapped under rubble following the explosion, the cause of which was not immediately clear.Hospitals called for blood donations and the Lebanese Red Crescent sent out an alert to paramedics, calling on them to rush to dispatch centres.Beirut City Governor Marwan Aboud said: Beirut is a disaster city and the scale of the damage is enormous and called the blast a national disaster akin to Hiroshima.Early reports in local media suggested the incident may have been an accidental explosion of fireworks stored at the port.A Hizbollah source told Lebanese media that the blast was unrelated to recent tensions between Israel and the militant group on Lebanon\u0027s southern border, saying there was no truth in everything that is being circulated about an Israeli strike on Hizbollah weapons in the port. The blast damaged balconies and blew out windows miles away, with the explosion heard across the city and some districts losing electricity.It comes as Lebanon faces its worst financial and economic crisis in decades.The country\u0027s powerful Hezbollah movement said all of the country\u0027s political powers must unite to overcome the painful catastrophe.Video showed damage to the offices of local newspaper the Daily Star, where the ceiling collapsed and shattered glass and dust covered overturned furniture.Buildings are shaking, tweeted one resident, while another wrote: An enormous, deafening explosion just engulfed Beirut.

Those responsible for this catastrophe will pay the price.Two huge explosions in Beirut\u0027s port sent an enormous blast across the city.At least 78 people are dead and more than 4,000 are injured.The blast has been blamed on 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that was stored at a warehouse.Lebanon\u0027s prime minister has vowed: Those responsible will pay the price.Hospitals already hit by coronavirus are struggling to treat victims.The blast was heard in Cyprus, 150 miles away.The explosion in Beirut has been blamed on thousands of tons of the chemical. But what is it?Ammonium nitrate is an industrial chemical used for fertiliser. It is also used for mining explosives.It is not explosive on its own, but as an oxidiser it can suck oxygen into a fire. However, Gabriel da Silva, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Melbourne, said it ignites only under the right circumstances.“You need extreme circumstances to set off an explosion,” he told .Ammonium nitrate can actually smother a fire, but if the chemical itself is tainted or contaminated, for example with oil, it becomes explosive. “I think that’s what’s happened here,” said da Silva.The chemical in the air should disappear quickly but pollutants can have long-term effects, he said.A wounded man is evacuated by boat from the portA BBC reporter was carrying out an interview when the blast struck in Beirut. As she spoke on the Zoom call, the explosion erupted and shards of glass were seen on the floor.After the explosion, she crawled out from under a desk and appeared to be unharmed.It is unclear whether the air in the city has become dangerous to breathe following the blast.The US Embassy in Beirut released a statement advising that people wear masks and stay indoors, following “reports of toxic gases released in the explosion”.Many people’s windows have been shattered by the blast, making it difficult to avoid breathing the air outside.The windows of Lebanon\u0026#39s Government Palace were blasted outAn Australian was killed and the country\u0027s embassy damaged in the Beirut blasts.It\u0027s my deep regret to inform you that one Australian has been killed in this horrific blast, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told The Today Show.Australia\u0027s embassy was considerably damaged by the effects of the blast and some staff had been injured, Marise Payne, the Foreign Minister, told ABC radio.I\u0027m advised that about 95 per cent of the windows in the front of the chancery of the embassy have been blown out and that staff have been affected by a number of glass injuries, she said.Fortunately they are relatively minor and they have all been treated.President Trump has said the Beirut blast looks like a terrible attack and told reporters at the White House that he met with US generals who believe it was an attack.Mr Trump then suggested it was a bomb of some kind. The cause of the explosions is not yet certain, but Lebanese officials have not suggested that it was an attack.The US president also said that Washington would provide assistance. We have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon and we will be there to help, he said. Trump insisted his generals had told him the blast was a \u0026#34bomb\u0026#34Lebanon\u0027s Supreme Defence Council has recommended declaring Beirut a disaster-stricken city following a massive explosion, declaring a two-week state of emergency in the capital and handing over security responsibility to military authorities.President Michel Aoun has decided to release 100 billion Lebanese pounds (about £50 million) in emergency allocations from the 2020 budget.It also recommended ahead of a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday that a committee be tasked with investigating the blast and present its findings within five days to mete out the maximum punishment for those responsible. A fund worth about £50 million has been set up for emergency assistanceLebanon\u0027s president has said a state of emergency should be declared in Beirut for two weeks.Michael Aoun, in remarks published on the Presidency Twitter account, said it was unacceptable that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate was stored in a warehouse for six years without safety measures and vowed that those responsible would face the harshest punishments.Mr Aoun also called for an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday.Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, has said: I’d like to extend my deepest condolences to all those affected by the massive explosion at the port of Beirut today.  We are closely monitoring and stand ready to assist the people of Lebanon as they recover from this tragedy.Our team in Beirut has reported to me the extensive damage to a city and a people that I hold dear, an additional challenge in a time of already deep crisis.  We understand that the Government of Lebanon continues to investigate its cause and look forward to the outcome of those efforts.The \u0027s Josie Ensor reports that Lebanese media are suggesting that thousands of tons of nitrate may have gone up in the blast.The head of the Lebanese American University Hospital is calling for evacuation of Beirut due to the hazardous materials in the air from the explosion.Lebanon’s Health Minister has said that those who can leave the city should, saying the remnants of the explosion can have long-term deadly effects.A colossal fireball erupted, sending a huge shockwave tearing through entire districts of Beirut and momentarily obscuring the sun, Abbie Cheeseman and Campbell MacDiarmid write.The force of the blast threw some of the amateur cameramen off their feet. Further out the blastwave tore balconies from apartment buildings miles away.As dust covered the city, an enormous mushroom cloud rose overhead. It was like a nuclear explosion, said Walid Abdo, a 43-year-old school teacher in the neighbourhood of Gemayzeh near Beirut.Rumbling aftershocks continued for several minutes, as piercing screams rose as bystanders rushed to pull bloodied bodies from the rubble of damaged buildings. The explosion near Beirut\u0026#39s waterfront flattened much of the port areaFire crews struggled to contain the blaze after the explosionsA firefighter helps a wounded man at the sceneResidents described balconies being blown off and buildings collapsingEmergency teams rushed to the scene of the blastA small number of staff at the UK embassy in Beirut sustained non-life threatening injuries in the explosion and where necessary are receiving medical attention, a Foreign Office spokesperson told Sky News. No one from the embassy was killed.Some buildings in Beirut still standing bear the scars of the explosionsLebanon\u0027s Prime Minister Hassan Diab has urged friendly countries to send help after the catastrophe.I am sending an urgent appeal to all countries that are friends and brothers and love Lebanon, to stand by its side and help us treat these deep wounds, he said in a televised address.President Macron has tweeted his support to the people of Lebanon: I express my fraternal solidarity with the Lebanese after the explosion which claimed so many victims and caused so much damage this evening in Beirut.France stands alongside Lebanon.

Many have lost jobs, while the worth of their savings has evaporated as the currency has plunged in value against the dollar. The result has thrown many into poverty.It also comes amid rising tensions between Israel and the militant Hezbollah group along Lebanon\u0027s southern border.The explosion was reminiscent of massive blasts during Lebanon\u0027s civil war and took place only three days before a UN-backed tribunal was set to give its verdict in the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a truck bombing more than 15 years ago. That explosion, with a ton of explosives, was felt miles away, just like Tuesday\u0027s explosion.It was the latest chapter for a country that has suffered a 15-year civil war, repeated conflict with Israel, political assassinations and various other crises including the current unprecedented financial and economic crisis.FCO Spokesperson said: “We are closely monitoring the situation in Beirut following reports of an explosion”Tobias Ellwood, Chairman of the Defence Select Committee and Former Middle East minister said today’s explosions “takes Lebanon into a darker chapter than it’s already experiencing, given the state of the economy and the unstable political environment”.“You can’t rule out a deliberate intention to further destabilise an already fragile country,” he told The . “We know the complexities of Beirut. It simply isn’t coping given the tense neighbourhood it finds itself in. We need to provide greater international support for this country that for too long has been suffering from the fall out of the Syria conflict, on top of its own internal political ision.”Hundreds of people who were injured in the Beirut port blast were taken to hospitals but many remain trapped in homes damaged by the explosion, the head of the Lebanese Red Cross said.George Kettaneh told local media there was no exact figure of how many were injured as many were still trapped in homes and within the area of the blast. Others were being rescued by boat.Lebanese broadcaster LBCI quoted Hotel Dieu Hospital in Beirut as saying that was treating more than 500 injuries and was not able to receive more. Tens of injured needed operations, the hospital said appealing for blood donations. James Rothwell in Jerusalem writes:Within minutes of the explosion, spurious rumours began to circulate online that Israel had played some role in the blast at the port of Beirut, which occurred at around 6pm local time. Some Arabic news channels falsely reported that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, had claimed responsibility for the attack.In fact, Mr Netanyahyu had issued a statement about an unrelated Israeli airstrike in Syria, which was in retaliation for an attempted terror attack at Israel\u0027s northeastern border with Syria earlier this week. This was then misattributed to the incident in Beirut, according to Elizabeth Tsurkov, a leading Syria analyst. Israeli officials have stressed that they had nothing to do with the explosion.Tensions between Israel and Hizbollah, a Lebanese militant group backed by Iran, have soared in recent weeks at the border between Israel and Lebanon, as well as at the Israel-Syria border. Hizbollah has vowed revenge for an airstrike attributed to Israel which it says killed one of their fighters. Israel says it recently thwarted an attempted attack by Hizbollah at the Lebanese border, firing on a group of armed men as they crossed into Israeli territory. Even Hizbollah has denied Israel played any role in the Beirut explosion, according to Lebanese media, which quoted a Hizbollah source who distanced the group from the rumour. Lebanon\u0027s Head of General Security says the blast was caused by a fire in a depot of highly explosive material, including Sodium nitrate, at Beirut\u0027s port. He said that material was confiscated from a ship months ago and stored there.The US Pentagon said: We are aware of the explosion and are concerned for the potential loss of life due to such a massive explosion.At least 10 bodies have been taken to hospitals following a massive explosion in Beirut\u0027s port area, a Lebanese security source and a medical source told Reuters. Coronavirus latest news: Quarantine failure allowed 10,000 infected travellers into the UKWhy Beirut’s explosion was years in the makingUS announces highest-level visit in decades to TaiwanIsaias kills at least six people as Tropical Storm pounds United StatesUp to 10,000 Covid-infected people entered UK to fuel spread of disease after Government lifted restrictions, say MPs\u0026#39Silver streamers\u0026#39 discover Netflix as lockdown Britain is glued to the TVComment: Useful idiots like Jeremy Corbyn are making the lives of Britain\u0026#39s enemies easierBeirut explosions: What is ammonium nitrate and why did it cause the blasts?Beirut explosions: Huge blasts rock Lebanon\u0026#39s capital, killing at least 100 and wounding more than 4,000Quarantine fiasco allowed 10,000 infected arrivals into the UKRoss set to be crowned Scottish Tory leader as no challengers emergeLockdown creates cultural class ide as wealthy watch more TV, study findsVJ Day: Duke of Edinburgh to feature in \u0026#39then and now\u0026#39 montageFuneral service advert banned for claiming competitors \u0026#39took advantage of vulnerable customers\u0026#39Some nursery staff paid less than £5 an hour as high turnover hits children\u0026#39s education, report saysPatients who received poor maternity care could be part of new panel rating Government\u0026#39s performanceDuchess of Cambridge bursts into tears after hearing about young family struggles during lockdownBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new emperor penguin colonies discovered using satellites","story":"Emperor penguins have been hiding from us, satellite images have revealed, after scientists discovered 11 additional colonies in the Antarctic.The new colonies, three of which were previously identified but never confirmed, provides a welcome boost to population numbers by around 25,000 to 50,000 - bringing the global total to around half a million.But the researchers, of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), warned the locations are likely to be impacted by climate change, signaling potential disaster for the great birds.It follows previous studies which have estimated the species could drastically decline by the end of the century due to global warming.The findings, reported in the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation, were made using images from the European Commission\u0027s Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite.The powerful satellite enabled the researchers to monitor existing colonies and discover the new ones quickly by scouring the images in search of “brown pixels”, which would indicate penguin colonies.The 11 colonies were located on Antarctica’s coastline, two in the peninsula region, three in the west and the remaining six in the east.They included two new breeding sites on ice shelves, as well as two off-shore sites.The latter colonies were more than 100 miles offshore on sea ice which had formed around grounded icebergs, in what the researchers said was “a surprising new finding”.“Recognition that emperor penguins can breed a long way from the coast is important it confirms that potential breeding habitat exists in areas not previously documented,” the researchers said.But as the new areas are further north, meaning they will be in warmer temperatures, they are more likely to be susceptible to melting ice, they added.And, using data from a 2019 study which mapped areas most likely to be impacted by climate change, the researchers found the new colonies are all located in areas where colonies are expected to be extinct or quasi-extinct by the end of the century.Although the small size of the colonies does suggest there could be even smaller ones elsewhere, their existence would be unlikely to contribute greatly to global populations, they said.“It is evident that future climate change is likely to affect them,” they said. “Our findings therefore suggest the possibility of an even greater proportion of the global population will be vulnerable to climate change, than previously considered.”Dr Phil Trathan, Head of Conservation Biology at BAS, said: “Birds in these sites are therefore probably the \u0027canaries in the coalmine\u0027 - we need to watch these sites carefully as climate change will affect this region.Dr Caroline Coch, Polar Specialist at WWF, said urgent action was needed to protect the penguins, including marine protected areas and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.“Emperor penguins, though adapted to the most extreme and remote frontier of our planet, now find themselves living on the frontline of the climate crisis.

The businesses need the customers but we would just like a bit of respect back for the town that they claim to love,” town mayor Nikki Turnton said. Her plea comes amid rising tensions in the UK between rural residents and British tourists looking to holiday in the countryside, as nearly one third of people are having a staycation this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic. Farmers from the Lake District to North Wales have reported cases of amateur ‘wild campers’ leaving festival-style mess in the middle of fields, abandoned tents on the side of mountains, and lighting open campfires in irresponsible places. Instagram influencers are driving a huge interest in wild camping in the UK this summer, experts say, as people have been “penned down” for months and want to create the “authentic experience” they see on social media now more than ever.Richard Prideaux, who teaches wild camping skills in North Wales, said a blog post he wrote two years ago about where to wild camp in the UK has received 30,000 hits in the past few weeks alone. “There is definitely a massively increased interest in wild camping at the moment,” he told the . “People who would have gone on a cheap holiday overseas are this year looking at doing something in the UK.”But with the increased crowds come increasing amounts of litter - so much so that the term ‘wild camping’ has recently become synominsed to ‘dirty camping’ in the outdoor industry. “The rubbish is a particular concern,” Mr Prideaux added. “My friends who live in various villages in North Wales have been seeing bags of rubbish dumped on the side of quiet roads and people having fires right next to the road. “This year the magnitude is definitely worse because everyone was penned down in lockdown and now they want to go out and do stuff and they have fewer overseas options to do it.”Mountain rescue teams are also struggling with the increasing number of Britons swapping Lake Como in Italy for the Lake District this summer. Richard Warren, chairman of the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association, said the “tidal wave” of lost and injured staycationers is pushing them to breaking point. Of the 19 call outs they have handled since Friday, 11 were “truly avoidable”. Meanwhile, police in Aberystwyth, West Wales, warned against the fashionable wild swimming trend after a nine-year-old boy and his mother were swept away in a river. The pair survived the incident, but the coastguard said the rescue was like a scene from Apocalypse Now and urged inexperienced swimmers not to try swimming in open water to make up for pools being closed. Julian Glover, who wrote an independent review for the Government on England’s national parks last year, called for more education on how to respect the UK’s rural areas. “It is a good thing that people want to come out of towns to walk and enjoy the landscape. We should support that. We can’t close the countryside off. But in return we need to make sure that the people who come protect what is special about those places,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beirut explosions ammonium nitrate","story":"Ammonium nitrate, which Lebanese authorities have said was the cause of the Beirut blast, is an odourless crystalline substance commonly used as a fertiliser that has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the decades.These include at a Texas fertiliser plant in 2013 that killed 15 people and was ruled deliberate, and another at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in 2001 that killed 31 people but was accidental.When combined with fuel oils, ammonium nitrate creates a potent explosive widely used by the construction industry, but also by insurgent groups like the Taliban for improvised explosives.It was also a component in the bomb behind the 1995 Oklahoma City attack.In agriculture, ammonium nitrate fertiliser is applied in granule form and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen - which is key to plant growth - to be released into the soil.Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab said 2,750 metric tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored for years in a Beirut portside warehouse had blown up, killing dozens of people and causing unprecedented damage to the Lebanese capital.However, under normal storage conditions and without very high heat, it is difficult to ignite ammonium nitrate, Jimmie Oxley, a chemistry professor at the University of Rhode Island, told AFP.I am assuming that there was a small explosion that instigated the reaction of the ammonium nitrate - whether that small explosion was an accident or something on purpose I haven\u0027t heard yet.That\u0027s because ammonium nitrate is an oxidiser - it intensifies combustion and allows other substances to ignite more readily, but is not itself very combustible.For these reasons, there are generally very strict rules about where it can be stored for example, it must be kept away from fuels and sources of heat.In fact, many countries in the European Union require that calcium carbonate be added to ammonium nitrate to create calcium ammonium nitrate, which is safer.In the United States, regulations were tightened significantly after the Oklahoma City attack.Under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, for example, facilities that store more than 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) of ammonium nitrate are subject to inspections.Despite its dangers, Jimmie Oxley said legitimate uses of ammonium nitrate in agriculture and construction had made it indispensable.We wouldn\u0027t have this modern world without explosives, and we wouldn\u0027t feed the population we have today without ammonium nitrate fertiliser, she said.We need ammonium nitrate, we just need to pay good attention to what we\u0027re doing with it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beiruts explosion years making","story":"It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong for Lebanon. The country - described in better times variously as the Paris of the Middle East for its exuberant glamour and the Switzerland of the region for its exemplary banking sector - had looked to be thriving in recent years.Tourist numbers were up, the beaches along its beautiful Mediterranean coastline were packed. The middle classes appeared more comfortable than they had ever been.For those who had money at least, Lebanon was a pleasant enough place to live. But the image belied a much more complicated reality - something I witnessed first-hand as a correspondent in the capital, Beirut, for The .Lebanon had borrowed up to its eyeballs and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst. Corruption and greed among its ruling class - warlords who had held onto power since the end of the civil war in 1990 - had helped bleed the country dry. The politicians didn’t even bother trying to hide it, simply blaming one another for the empty coffers.Infighting between the competing religious sects over who would be awarded the spoils had left them virtually incapable of governing. The problem with Lebanon, as Marwan Muasher, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it, is that “corruption has been democratised, it’s not sitting centrally with one man. It’s all over.”Many in Lebanon had predicted an explosion, though few could have imagined it would come in the form of the 2,750-tonne blast that would devastate half the city.Beirutis on Tuesday began cursing the country’s politicians before an official investigation was even underway. Experience had taught them that either incompetence or negligence would be behind the disaster, which has claimed the lives of at least 75 people and injured as many as 3,000 more.Initial reports suggested that authorities had seized several thousand tonnes of highly combustible ammonium nitrate a number of years ago and had been storing it at the seaport. The blast was suspected to have been triggered by a welder\u0027s fire.Questions will soon be asked as to who signed off on the idea to keep such a large quantity of a volatile and explosive substance stored in a densely populated civilian area. “What exploded today in Beirut is not just ammonium nitrate. It is above all corruption, mismanagement, incompetency and cynical disregard for the security and lives of people,” wrote Lebanese national Dyab Abou Jahjah, expressing the thoughts of many of his countrymen.“They killed us financially. They killed us economically, added Sara Asaaf. They killed us physically. They killed us morally. They killed us chemically. There’s not one form of death they haven’t used with us. Damn our political class.Lebanon had for months been teetering towards ruin.By the time I left Beirut in February after a four-year reporting stint, there were daily street protests against government corruption. Saad Hariri, the prime minister (of course the son of a previous premier) stepped down only to be replaced by another equally loathed businessman.Then the coronavirus hit. Lebanon had the sense to shut down - fearing that its already beleaguered hospitals would not be able to cope with a major outbreak. But the lockdown sent its poorest - rendered jobless - spiralling into even deeper poverty.At the same time, the country was beginning to feel the full effect of its freefalling economy. The country’s currency lost 60 per cent in value in a matter of weeks. Last month it became the first in the Middle East in history to experience hyperinflation.Food prices soared 200 per cent. A jar of instant Nescafe coffee peaked at $50 - a week’s wages for many.Beirut\u0027s once proud and thriving middle class have been forced to sell possessions online. Some have even begged for money for nappies. They knew there was no point looking to the government for help, it had been unable to provide the basics to its people - including water and electricity - even during the “good times”.On Monday, the country’s foreign minister resigned, warning that a lack of vision and a will to implement reforms risked turning Lebanon into a “failed state.” There is little to suggest it can do much now to avoid its wretched fate.Thousands in the Lebanese capital would have had a restless sleep in their dark, hot and windowless homes last night, contemplating what has befallen them. The windows may have been knocked out by the blast, but the darkness was of the country’s own making.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 5th august 2020","story":"Museum Technician Andy Monk cleans the 27 foot glass Rotunda Chandelier by Dale Chihuly, which is made up of 1,300 blue and green glass elements, at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, as it prepares to reopen to the publicCoronavirus latest news: Quarantine failure allowed 10,000 infected travellers into the UKBeirut explosions: Blast detonated 2,750 tons of chemicals - latest news and videoWhy Beirut’s explosion was years in the makingUS announces highest-level visit in decades to TaiwanIsaias kills at least six people as Tropical Storm pounds United States\u0026#39Silver streamers\u0026#39 discover Netflix as lockdown Britain is glued to the TVComment: Useful idiots like Jeremy Corbyn are making the lives of Britain\u0026#39s enemies easierUp to 10,000 Covid-infected people entered UK to fuel spread of disease after Government lifted restrictions, say MPsBeirut explosions: What is ammonium nitrate and why did it cause the blasts?Beirut explosions: Huge blasts rock Lebanon\u0026#39s capital, killing at least 100 and wounding more than 4,000Quarantine fiasco allowed 10,000 infected arrivals into the UKRoss set to be crowned Scottish Tory leader as no challengers emergeLockdown creates cultural class ide as wealthy watch more TV, study findsVJ Day: Duke of Edinburgh to feature in \u0026#39then and now\u0026#39 montageFuneral service advert banned for claiming competitors \u0026#39took advantage of vulnerable customers\u0026#39Some nursery staff paid less than £5 an hour as high turnover hits children\u0026#39s education, report saysPatients who received poor maternity care could be part of new panel rating Government\u0026#39s performanceDuchess of Cambridge bursts into tears after hearing about young family struggles during lockdownBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"useful idiots like jeremy corbyn making lives britains enemies","story":"Given the questionable company Jeremy Corbyn has kept throughout his political career, it is no surprise that he should find himself at the centre of a Russian email-hacking scandal.During his unmemorable stint as Labour Party leader, Mr Corbyn rarely missed an opportunity to demonstrate his credentials as one of Moscow’s more reliable useful idiots. Arguably the high point of his Russophilia came in the aftermath of the Salisbury poisonings two years ago, when he declined to criticise Moscow in the face of incontrovertible evidence that the attack was carried out by Russia’s GRU intelligence service.Mr Corbyn’s natural inclination to side with one of Britain’s most committed foes was entirely in keeping with decades of anti-British activity, from supporting the IRA at the height of its terrorist campaign against the British state to his more lucrative association with Iran’s ayatollahs, where he earned around $30,000 as a contributor to Tehran’s Press TV – until the channel was banned by British regulators for its part in filming the detention and torture of an Iranian journalist.Now, as revealed by The Daily  yesterday, it transpires that, during last year’s general election campaign, Mr Corbyn made use of classified documents that had apparently been stolen from the email account of Dr Liam Fox, the former international trade secretary, by Russian hackers.The documents, which Mr Corbyn did not know had been obtained through hacking, referred to sensitive details concerning US-UK trade negotiations and were used by the Labour leader during an election rally to attack the Government for putting the NHS “up for sale”.The fact that Mr Corbyn had employed material stolen by Russian hackers to gain the advantage in a British general election was made public last month by the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, who revealed that “Russian actors” had sought to influence the election result by leaking illicitly acquired government documents.What makes Mr Corbyn’s conduct even more contemptible is that it now appears the documents were obtained after Russia hacked the private emails of a serving cabinet minister.Dr Fox himself is not entirely beyond reproach when it comes to safeguarding sensitive material, as he has something of a reputation for being accident prone in terms of breaches of sensitive information. On the eve of the 2010 general election, when Dr Fox was shadow defence secretary, he prompted a major security scare when his laptop computer was stolen from his London flat.On another occasion, as defence secretary, he was forced to call in the police after a personal letter to David Cameron warning of “draconian” defence cuts was leaked to this newspaper.The suggestion that Russian hackers were able to access Dr Fox’s account multiple times between July and October last year certainly raises some important questions as to whether measures put in place by the National Cyber Security Centre to protect government communications are effective against hostile states, such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.Moreover, there is no shortage of useful idiots operating at the highest level of British politics who have no qualms about associating with hostile states.For example, the most striking conclusion reached by the recent investigation conducted by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) into Russian meddling in British politics was Moscow’s involvement in attempts to influence the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.At the time Alex Salmond, the then SNP leader, made no secret of his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he “publicly admired” certain aspects of his involvement in Crimea, which led to Moscow’s unlawful annexation of the province.Since standing down as SNP leader, Mr Salmond has become a regular fixture on Moscow’s state-run RT propaganda channel. Moreover, Mr Salmond has resisted pressure to end his association with RT, despite the ISC report accusing the channel of putting out “serious distortions” in its coverage of British politics.Nor is the willingness of Britain’s useful idiots to champion the interests of hostile states confined to Moscow. The recent political controversy over the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has exposed an array of senior political and business figures who appear quite comfortable defending the interests of Beijing’s communist rulers.Indeed, it is entirely feasible that Britain’s sizeable pro-Beijing lobbying community would have succeeded in protecting Huawei’s stake in the country’s 5G network, with all the implications that would have had for our national security, had it not been for the intense pressure Downing Street came under from Washington to end the company’s involvement.It is crucial, therefore, that we do not underestimate the importance of useful idiots like Mr Corbyn in helping hostile states like Russia and China to achieve their nefarious objectivesMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/04/17/shutterstock-editorial-5881960i.jpg","title":"bryan cranston malcom in the middle reunion cast when","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Reunion is happening later this weekThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A more effective test and trace system is needed to make schools and parents feel more confident as students return in September, headteachers have told The Independent following a recent study into the programme. Simon Smith, who leads a primary school in Yorkshire, said test and trace was a “key element” in keeping schools safe. “Parents need to feel all the systems are there,” he told The Independent, ”and that if something does happen, things will happen very, very quickly in terms of the actions that schools will take”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Track and trace is a key part of that,” the headteacher at East Whitby Primary Academy said.His comments come after a study has suggested the government must scale-up its test and trace system - which tells people if they have been contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and to isolate for two weeks – to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections as schools fully reopen. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyOne of the authors, Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the current testing system has “about 50 per cent coverage”.A government minister said the plan for English schools to welcome all students back next month is “not up for debate” on Tuesday following the study’s publication. Speaking about test and trace, Mr Smith from East Whitby Primary Academy said: “As a headteacher, I feel very little confidence at the moment around the fact we would be informed, or everybody is being informed that should be informed.“It may be people are wandering around with the virus without knowing.”Pepe Di’Iasio, a headteacher near Rotherham, said a scaled-up test and trace system would help his school feel better prepared for the September return. “I think we would all feel better if we had confidence in the system and obviously with four weeks to go,” Mr Di’Iasio, who is also vice president elect of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told The Independent. “We would rather have that confidence as quickly as possible.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers from University College London and LSHTM simulated various scenarios to examine the possible implications of schools reopening in the UK coupled with broader reopening of society, such as more parents returning to the workplace and increased socialising within the community.The authors of the modelling study – published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health - found that “with increased levels of testing... and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.“Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave,” Mr Bonell from LSHTM said.“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage,” he added.The NAHT, a school leaders’ union, said the new research showed “just how many factors there are to preventing a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, most of which are entirely outside a school’s control”.Efficient test-trace-isolate system needed to reopen schools- studyMinisters still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMPs criticise school meal voucher scheme for covering M\u0026ampS but not LidlPaul Whiteman, the general secretary, said: “The success of September’s return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within.”He added: “The government needs to ensure that everyone knows what actions they should be taking to keep everyone safe – we’re all going to need to work together to be successful.”Meanwhile, Richard Bettsworth from ASCL said: “It is very clear that an effective test, trace, and isolate strategy is vital in suppressing the rate of infection, and keeping schools open.” The director of public affairs added: “The government has to make sure that this works at the scale that is necessary.”Schools are expected to fully reopen to all students in September.  A government spokesperson said: “We have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 16 million tests have been delivered so far and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.“Plans have been put in place to ensure schools can re-open safely. Local health officials, using the latest data, will able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases.They added: “The NHS Test and Trace service has now and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive – in order to break the chain of transmission.”Additional reporting by Press Associationtest and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The race to find a Covid-19 vaccine continues to gather pace at lightning speed, with a total of 26 candidates currently in the clinical evaluation stage of development, according to the World Health Organisation.A process that typically takes between 10 and 15 years, vaccine production is being worked on by governments and leading pharmaceutical companies, who are hoping to find a vaccine— and a way out of the coronavirus pandemic — by the end of the year.Of the 26 candidates that are being trialled on humans, only a handful of these have entered into phase three of testing — the final stage before regulatory approval is then secured (or denied).Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAlthough it is too soon to say which of these candidates will be successful, here we take a closer look at the leading vaccine prospects, what stage they are at and what we can expect to see in the coming months:How does it work?Oxford’s candidate is a viral vector vaccine and is made from a genetically engineered virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees. It has been weakened to ensure it does not trigger any disease in humans and is modified to express the spike protein seen on Sars-CoV-2 – the tool used by the virus to invade human cells.‘Vaccine nationalism’: Is it every country for itself?When this genetic material enters the human body, it “helps teach the immune system to recognise the Sars-CoV-2 virus”, according to professor Andrew Pollard, the study lead.What’s the latest?In research published last month in the journal Lancet, scientists said the vaccine produced a dual immune response in 1,077 volunteers aged 18 to 55 — provoking a T-cell response within 14 days of vaccination and an antibody response after 28 days.More trials will need to be conducted to establish how long these cells last within the body. It is also unclear whether the vaccine can prevent people from falling ill or lessen the symptoms of Covid-19.Phase two and three trials evaluating the vaccine’s effectiveness have been expanded beyond the UK to South Africa, Brazil and the US, where infections rates are still high, to allow researchers to assess whether the candidate can block or limit transmission among large populations.Oxford University has partnered with AstraZeneca to produce the vaccine globally, with the pharmaceutical giant committed to making two billion doses if it proves to work.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHow does it work?The Chinese biopharmaceutical has developed an inactivated vaccine that uses a non-infectious version of the virus to provoke an immune response.What’s the latest? The Beijing-based drug maker’s vaccine, called CoronaVac, induced neutralising antibodies in “above 90 per cent” of people who were tested 14 days after receiving two injections, two weeks apart. There were no severe side effects reported.The preliminary results were from a 600-patient, placebo-controlled phase three study.Sinovac last month moved into phase three trials in Brazil and will recruit nearly 9,000 healthcare professionals throughout the country.Demonstrating that vaccines provoke an immune response and protect people from the virus requires data on 20,000–40,000 people who have been split into control and test groups and then followed closely for several months, scientists say. Concern has therefore been raised whether Sinovac’s trials will be able to collect enough data, and whether it will be suitable given healthcare workers wear proper PPE and might not face greater exposure to the virus compared to the rest of the population.How does it work?The American biotech firm is one of a handful of companies attempting to develop a mRNA vaccine. Whereas the more traditional methods of vaccine development introduce an inactivated or weakened form of Sars-CoV-2 to the body, the mRNA approach delivers genetic material to human cells that instruct them to make the ‘spike’ proteins seen on the surface of the coronavirus.An immune cell then perceives the spike proteins as if the body has been infected. It kicks off a sequence of events that results in the creation of antibodies and other defences.No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved for an infectious disease, and Moderna has never brought a product to market. But proponents of the vaccine say it could be easier and quicker to mass produce, as only small quantities of the virus are used for gene sequencing and vaccine testing.US coronavirus vaccine reaches final stage of testingWhat’s the latest?Moderna’s experimental vaccine provoked an immune response in all 45 healthy volunteers who took part in the first stage of its study. However, a second injection, four weeks after the first, was required before the vaccine produced a dramatic immune response.No study volunteers experienced a serious side effect, but more than half reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site.Moderna’s phase three trial, launched late last month, will involve an estimated 30,000 participants tested at 89 sites spread across 30 states and the District of Columbia. The aim is to determine if two doses of the mRNA vaccine prevent people from catching Covid-19, stop those with the disease from dying, or both.Dr Anthony Fauci, the White House’s chief coronavirus advisor, said last month that results from the trial might be available by November. How does it work?US drugmaker Pfizer and German biotech firm BioNTech are collaborating to design a mRNA vaccine which makes use of the same technology adopted by Moderna.What’s the latest?Early last month, BioNTech said testing of two dosages of its BNT162b1 drug on 24 healthy volunteers showed that after 28 days they had developed higher levels of Covid-19 antibodies than typically seen in infected people.It said the higher of the two doses – both administered via two injections within three weeks of one another – was followed by a short fever in three out of four participants after the second shot.Pfizer and BioNTech last month launched a phase three trial that will recruit 30,000 people from 39 states in the United States, and from Brazil, Argentina and Germany.The US government announced in July that it had reached a $1.95 billion deal to buy 100 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine by the year’s end, but only if the trial proves it safe and effective. A total of 120 million doses will also be delivered to Japan, starting in 2021. CanSino Biologics: The Chinese biopharmaceutical is still in phase two of its trial, but in June it received limited approval from the government to use its vaccine among military personnel, for one year only.Sinopharm: China’s state-run pharmaceutical company last month launched its phase three trial among 15,000 volunteers —aged 18 to 60, with no serious underlying conditions— in the United Arab Emirates. Murdoch Children’s Research Institute: The paediatric medical research firm, based in Melbourne, is conducting a phase 3 trial using a nearly 100-year-old tuberculosis vaccine.Although the WHO has said there is no evidence to suggest this form of vaccine protects people against Covid-19, it has been suggested it might boost the body’s non-specific immune response.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Joaquin Phoenix and Alicia Silverstone are pleading with the owners of a farm where goats were brutally attacked to hand the animals over to sanctuaries.The Hollywood actors, together with singers Moby and Leona Lewis, Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch and Downton Abbey star Peter Egan, have signed an open letter to the farm, which is linked to the UK’s best-known goat milk producer, St Helen’s Farm. Government, council and trading standards officials are investigating conditions at Far Marsh Farm in East Yorkshire, where three members of staff were sacked and one given a final warning after The Independent exposed shocking scenes of animal brutality behind closed doors.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWorkers were secretly filmed punching, kicking and hitting goats with a pole animals were also painfully slammed on their backs, had their tails twisted or were held by the neck.“We ask you only to do the right thing – allow as many of your goats as possible to be rehomed to sanctuaries, and transition Far Marsh Farm away from animal farming to ensure that no others will ever be abused there again,” the letter says.Activists work to save goats at farm where workers attacked animalsLewis, who is vegan and trustee of an animal sanctuary in Essex, contacted Surge animal rights group, who had first received the footage, after reading The Independent‘s piece exposing the brutality.Marks \u0026amp Spencer and all the big supermarkets except Morrisons said they pulled St Helen’s Farm products, including milk, cheese and butter, from sale after seeing the footage. Angus Wielkopolski, founder of Yorkshire Dairy Goats, which owns the farm, told The Independent last week he may have to close the 4,000-animal site if he cannot salvage its reputation.But since then, Mr Wielkopolski has not been contactable, and the fate of the 4,000 animals is unknown. The Independent is seeking his response to offers to rehome the goats in sanctuaries and to help him find ways to keep his business going without using animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMore than 40,000 people have signed a petition also calling on Far Marsh Farm’s owners to put the goats in safe hands.Farm at centre of goat cruelty scandal may have to close, owners saySurge drew up the celebrity letter to St Helen’s and its parent company Kavli UK, and has found places for some of the animals.The organisation is also pressing farm bosses to accept help in ending goat farming.This could be done through Refarm’d, a company that specialises in helping dairy farmers to switch to producing plant milk and convert their land into sanctuaries, Surge says.A move “from goat milk to oat milk” would be environmentally beneficial and offer a sustainable income, the letter argues. Other uses of the land include arable crops, growing pulses and produce for human food, and to rewilding, it saysIt adds: “The farming we propose may be referred to as alternative today, but one day it will be the main form of agriculture, making best use of land and resources and addressing growing environmental pressures production of  their lands.”Phoenix, the star of Joker and also a vegan, is to be an executive producer, with his wife Rooney Mara, of a new documentary on links between factory farming and pandemics.Mara, her actor sister Kate, actress Alexandra Paul, Olympic athlete Dotsie Bausch and actor Lucy Watson also signed the letter.Supermarkets drop goat-milk firm after violent attacks on animalsAt the same time, questions are being raised over the links between Far Marsh Farm and the St Helen’s Farm brand.St Helen’s Farm said Far Marsh Farm was just one of a number of its suppliers, and that it cut ties with the farm after the cruelty was revealed.But it can be revealed that Yorkshire Dairy Goats (YDG), which owns the farm, was previously called St Helen’s Farm Goats, and is registered at St Helen’s Farm’s main office.YDG is part-owned, through a minority investment, by Kavli Investments Ltd, part of Kavli UK Ltd, which also owns the St Helen’s Farm brand.But Kavli has declined to comment on the future of the goats, when pressed by The Independent.A spokeswoman for Kavli UK said answers must come from YDG, adding: “Day-to-day operations and managerial control of Far Marsh Farm is held by Angus and Kathleen Wielkopolski.Goats punched, hit and ‘left lame’ at farm supplying supermarket milk“The fact that St Helen’s Farm stopped taking milk from Far Marsh Farm immediately after we were informed about this mistreatment of animals demonstrates both our commitment to animal welfare and that we will not accept anything other than the highest standards from all of our suppliers. “Under no circumstances will we accept that any of the goats on our supplying farms are mistreated in any way.”Kavli UK bought the St Helen’s Farm dairy from the Wielkopolskis in 2013 and so has full ownership and management responsibility of St Helen’s Farm, she added.“At that time, a minority investment was also made in Yorkshire Dairy Goats, with one of its two farms being Far Marsh Farm, the farm at the centre of this issue.”East Yorkshire council health officers say they are investigating together with government officials from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).An APHA spokesperson said: “We are investigating the allegations of animal welfare legislation breaches. Where welfare regulations are breached, appropriate action is taken.“We do not comment on inidual cases.”The RSPCA says it may take action if APHA does not.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Helping their families through these extraordinary times.”Kate Middleton shares rare photo on anniversary of British Red CrossKate Middleton and Prince William share unseen photo of Prince LouisKate meets families at children’s hospice as she helps plant gardenDuke and Duchess of Cambridge share new photos of Prince GeorgeBaby banks found themselves under increasing pressure as demand for their services mounted during the coronavirus crisis and they were unable to accept second hand donations for fear the virus may spread through contaminated surfaces.Having previously visited Baby Basics in West Norfolk, Kate encouraged donations from 19 brands and high street retailers to Baby Basics, Little Village and AberNecessities, who run baby banks across the country.She helped unpack donations of clothes, toys and other necessities during her visit in Sheffield and spoke to parents about the invaluable support provided to them by the baby banks.Cat Ross, CEO of Baby Basics, told Kate: “Often in a world where there is a lot of judgement and stereotyping about being poor, that additional stress can be even more difficult for parents who are doing amazing things to keep their families going with such strength, such determination.”Ms Ross added there is a lot of “fear and worry” among people about what will happen when furlough periods come to an end and “what it means for families”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The prince has previously denied Ms Guiffre’s claim she was at a London club with him in 2001, saying he was at home after visiting the Woking branch of the pizza restaurant on the night she mentioned. Lisa Bloom, a US lawyer representing trafficking victims of Jeffrey Epstein, said she has passed information on to the FBI from a woman supporting Ms Giuffre’s version of events. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs Bloom said Shukri Walker allegedly remembers seeing Prince Andrew at the club with Ms Giuffre – then known as Virginia Roberts – and Epstein’s girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who was recently arrested in the US. The lawyer said Ms Walker “credibly alleges that she was there at the Tramp nightclub in 2001”. Prince Andrew’s ‘stamp of approval’ legitimised Ghislaine MaxwellCourt papers detail Prince Andrew’s alleged sex with Epstein victimPrince Andrew ‘lobbied US government for better plea deal for Epstein’She said the woman “specifically recalls Prince Andrew being there with Virginia Roberts Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell”, adding: ”She had never been in the presence of a royal before or since and so it was very memorable to her.”Ms Bloom said Ms Walker was “disappointed” when she saw the Duke of York deny being at the nightclub in a Newsnight interview. When quizzed about Ms Guiffre’s claim Prince Andrew was at the club with her on 10 March 2001, he replied he was at home that night. The prince said he had taken his daughter, Beatrice, to Pizza Express in Woking in the afternoon and returned home.When asked by Emily Maitlis how he remembered those details from nearly 20 years ago, he said it was because going to the pizza chain in the Surrey town was “an unusual thing for me to do”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Chicks exported to the EU will die unless they can be rushed through the chaos expected at UK ports next year, the government has admitted.A new document warns that Brexit will bring up to 10 months of disruption, with emergency traffic control measures in Kent to last until “the end of October 2021”.The report admits a 27-acre “clearance centre” being built near Ashford – which Michael Gove denied would become a giant lorry park – will, in fact, hold around 2,000 trucks.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it raises fears for live products, which lose up to 60 per cent of their value if they fail to reach EU destinations “within one to two days” – in particular day-old chicks. “They cannot be fed in their vehicle, and delays risk dehydration and mortality,” the document, published by transport secretary Grant Shapps, states.Government says medicines must be stockpiled for no-deal BrexitThe threat to live animals was described as “horrifying” by Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat leadership candidate, while a freight organisation said the proposals amounted to “an internal UK border”.It comes after the government advised medicine suppliers to begin stockpiling again for a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period, by building up six weeks’ worth of drugs.However, new port checks will be necessary even if the UK avoids crashing out without a deal, because even an agreement will not allow the free-flow of goods that takes place now.When the 2016 referendum was held, Brexit campaigners repeatedly denied such checks would be required – but now describe them as inevitable, under the prime minister’s clean-break plans.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The \u0027Timbuktu tumblers\u0027 from Kenya perform their balancing act on the Southsea waterfront as Zippos Circus reopens in PortsmouthPelicans interact with a visitor in St James\u0027s Park in LondonLewis Hamilton drives with a puncture towards the finish line to win the Formula One British Grand Prix at Silverstone Arsenal\u0027s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates with the trophy and teammates after winning the FA Cup, as play resumes behind closed doors following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease People enjoy the sunny weather at a Bournemouth BeachAn artist puts the finishing touches to a wax figure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the entrance line at Madame Tussaud\u0027s in London, as the attraction prepares to reopen to the public following the easing of lockdown restrictions in EnglandA member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

The current proposals leave too many questions unanswered and very little time available in which to identify and implement solutions to keep the country trading.”Ms Moran said: “We cannot afford this kind of chaos at our ports at a time we could be in the middle of fighting a second wave of coronavirus.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In June a pharmaceutical industry memo said original stockpiles meant for no deal had been “used up entirely” and that it might not be possible to replenish them before December, when the UK is due to leave the single market.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoris Johnson refused to extend the Brexit transition period last month despite disruption caused by coronavirus and the fact the UK is facing a cliff edge at the end of the year. Flagging trade talks mean it is increasingly likely that Britain will leave the single market without any trade agreement at all, with disruption to trade and supply chains expected.Why you shouldn’t lose any sleep over a no-deal BrexitNorthern Ireland customs rules not settled six months after Brexit“Holding additional stock in the UK provides a further buffer against some disruption and we believe, where it’s possible, it’s a valuable part of a robust contingency plan,” the letter, signed by Steve Oldfield, chief commercial officer at the department of health and social care, says.“We recognise that global supply chains are under significant pressure, exacerbated by recent events with Covid-19. However, we encourage companies to make stockpiling a key part of contingency plans, and ask industry, where possible, to stockpile to a target level of six weeks’ total stock on UK soil. DHSC stands ready to support companies with their plans if required and understands that a flexible approach to preparedness may be required that considers a mixture of stockpiling and rerouting plans as necessary.”But the memo reported earlier in the year from the pharmaceutical industry warned that there would be “less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products” thanks to the pandemic.It continued: “We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries.”Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers, from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that with increased levels of testing and effective contact tracing “an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyHowever, they warned: “Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave.”“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage.”Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, a lecturer in mathematical modelling at the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL and lead author of the study, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that if test and trace is “not done effectively, then there is a risk of an occurrence of a second wave later this year”.Pressed on the study, Mr Clarke told Sky News: “It’s obviously vital that we always continue to keep up the progress that we’re making with test and trace, which is a massive national undertaking and it is working, I really would emphasise that.” The housing minister said over 184,000 people have so far been contacted by the NHS test and trace programme after a contact tested positive for the virus. He added: “Those people have been allowed to self-isolate, be removed from the community at a time where they could be at risk of spreading the virus and that’s obviously a massive success.

So this is a programme, which is delivering and which is helping to keep us all safer. There’s always more to do, we continue to work very hard to boost our testing capacity – we’re on track to deliver half a million be the end of October. “But one thing is clear: schools are going to reopen in full in autumn, that is not up for debate.”Speaking in the Commons after the decision to drop the target of returning all primary school children back to classrooms before the summer holidays, Boris Johnson said “primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance”.No 10 yesterday reiterated the prime minister’s commitment, adding: “That’s vital for their education and development. We are planning for all pupils to return to school full-time from the beginning of the autumn term.”Schools reopening ‘risks second Covid-19 wave twice as big as first’Mr Clarke added: “There’s nothing gung-ho about getting schools back. There is little doubt about the major damage that it does to children’s education not to be in school. We’ve lost half a year now to this virus and some children’s education and it’s disrupted every child’s education.“It’s an absolute priority that we get on with this, it is a basic matter of social justice, there is a generation of children whose performance will be inhibited throughout the rest of their time in education unless we get this right and we’re confident that we can.”Speaking to Times Radio, former prime minister Tony Blair also urged the government to appoint a senior minister to be put in charge of testing, adding: “From the very beginning mass testing has been the only thing that gets you through this. “It allows you to avoid the severity of the very blunt instrument of lockdown and gets you to a place where you can more or less get your economy moving while you contain this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The death toll had already doubled within one hour. The blasts flattened much of the port in the Lebanese capital, damaging buildings and blowing out windows and doors as it struck with enough force to trigger Richter scale readings equivalent to a 3.5 magnitude earthquake.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesVideo footage showed a huge mushroom cloud rise above the capital, with thick plumes of smoke rising into the sky, which is thought to have been triggered by thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate which had been confiscated by the port years beforehand.Prime Minister Hassan Diab said that those responsible for the incident at a “dangerous” warehouse would pay the price.Huge blasts hit Beirut as buildings destroyed across city“I promise you that this catastrophe will not pass without accountability,” he said in a televised speech. In later comments he added that it was unacceptable that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were being stored in a warehouse.I will not rest until we find the person responsible for what happened so we can hold them to account and impose the most severe punishment, the prime minister was quoted as saying by an official Twitter account.It is unacceptable that a shipment of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate has been present for six years in a warehouse, without taking preventive measures and endangering the safety of citizens.Georges Kettaneh, a Lebanese Red Cross official, said hundreds of injured civilians had been taken to hospitals for treatment.

We fell to the ground, my son cried out ‘the bombing has started,’” she said, asking to remain anonymous.She spoke to The Independent in the hospital car park, which has been turned into a makeshift emergency department as the emergency room had been destroyed.“The pressure of the blast hit my chest – it felt like an atomic bomb had gone off. The windows were blown out, the entire street is destroyed – all the roads is covered in shattered glass.”“The explosions were worse than the bombing in the civil war. When I came to the hospital it was like the explosion took place inside the hospital not the port – patients were covered in blood.”In Cyprus –180 km (110 miles) northwest of Beirut – residents reported hearing two large bangs in quick succession. One resident of the capital Nicosia said his house shook, rattling shutters.It comes at a time of significant economic and political upheaval for Lebanon, with the country facing the worst financial crisis in decades.Video footage showed the incident first starting as a fire raging at the port, sending up a giant column of smoke, illuminated by flashes of what appear to be fireworks.The blaze then appeared to catch at a nearby building, triggering a more massive explosion, sending up a mushroom cloud and a shock wave over the city. The metal casing of shop fronts were torn open, cars were destroyed and belongings from flats scattered across the streets.The aftershock was felt in the mountains above Beirut, at least 13 miles away, and was so strong it blew out doors and windows in buildings across the city.Boris Johnson said the UK was ready to provide support and an unknown number of British nationals may have been affected.“The pictures and videos from Beirut tonight are shocking. All of my thoughts and prayers are with those caught up in this terrible incident,” he said in a statement on Twitter.Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “The images of explosions in Beirut are deeply worrying. Our thoughts are with those affected, the emergency services and the people of Lebanon.”Israel also offered to send aid to Lebanon, in a rare gesture between two countries still technically at war. The spokesperson from the US State Department said Washington was closely following the reports and stood ready to offer “all possible assistance”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Army helicopters were see helping battle fires still raging at the port, while ambulances carried away those who were wounded in the hours after the incident.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPhotos taken in the aftermath of the explosion show the true scale of devastation the explosion left behind. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored in a warehouse at the port for six years without safety measures and condemned it as “unacceptable” on Twitter.He called for a state of emergency to be declared in the Lebanese capital for two weeks.The Lebanese army joined forces with the Lebanese Red Cross and other rescue groups to try and help any survivors who may be trapped under debris. Dazed people with bloodied faces who were struck by flying debris when the explosion hit were seen in the flattened streets around the site.The Red Cross said on its Twitter account its teams “cannot reach all the wounded in their homes at the moment”, but they have set up first aid and triage stations to help those with non-critical injuries.Civilians were also seen helping, carrying survivors away from the ruined buildings and towards safety.Residents living more than a kilometre away from the site told PA news agency of its impact on their homes, shattering all windows and causing apartment balconies and ceilings to collapse.Paola Rebeiz, who lives in St Nicolas, south of the site, said there were “dead bodies on the street after glass fell on them”.“The house shook.

She has always been there in the background, just quietly getting on with it, with absolutely no fuss.Fuss, in fact, is clearly something that the royal has no time for as Anne was astonished to learn it takes Erin Doherty — the actress who plays her in the third series of The Crown — two hours to style her hair, as opposed to the “ten or  minutes” it takes Anne. I loved the portrayal of the young princess in the Netflix series: Down to earth, feisty and straightforward, which I suspect is accurate to a tee.I have always wondered whether the royals watch the drama and Princess Anne revealed she did and found it “quite interesting”.She was followed for more than a year by the filmmakers of Anne: The Princess Royal At , which also featured unseen family footage and interviews with her loved ones.I loved the stories from her children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, describing how she wouldfrom royal s in her glamorous outfits and head straight to their farm to tend to the animals.Zara said: “She’d come home from engagements in exactly what she was wearing, make-up on, put her welly boots on, jacket on, do her chickens and get her eggs.”The appealing thing about Princess Anne is her work ethic and how happy she is to stay in the background.Her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said: “She’s not a person that is constantly looking for praise. She gets on and does her work regardless because she thinks it’s important.”So it came as no surprise when Anne declared in the documentary that she would not go on Twitter “evenyou paid me”.Princess Anne is not the only hard-working royal, of course.Her brother Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, do loads of good work and are similarly modest in their approach.These members of the Royal Family are in stark contrast to Harry and Meghan, who claim that work is more important than anything , but rarely get on with it quietly.After all, Princess Anne does her job brilliantly, with no whinging or whining, and still remains out of the spotlight, which proves it can be done.Another appealing trait of Anne’s is her modesty about how hard she works. She has no intention of slowing down, despite being old enough to retire.She’s a credit to her family and the Queen — and the two of them clearly have a lot in common.I loved watching them interact and seeing that mother-daughter bond. You can see there’s real affection there. And what a great, dry sense of humour they both have.So it’s nice to watch something positive about the Royal Family these days.By simply being herself in the documentary, Princess Anne has generated more positive PR for the monarchy than it has had in a very long while.LOOKING at pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram promoting a ready-to-drink brand of organic cocktails, I found myself thinking that no matter how much some people want to hate her, Gwyneth comes across as enviably wholesome, gorgeous, healthy . . . and probably a really nice person.The bottom line is that anyone who says they hate her is almost certainly just jealous.I AM so proud our national game has signed up to the Mentally Healthy Football Declaration, which urges young men – and men of all ages, in fact – to talk about their feelings, which is something males traditionally seem to struggle with.We can talk about the THEORY of mental health all we like but the power of role models, particularly for young guys, is immense.So it is lovely to see some footballing greats being open and honest about their own mental health – and the fact things haven’t always necessarily been rosy in the garden throughout their lives.Spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge, the campaign is designed to make mental health a priority across all levels of football.So kudos to former England captain David Beckham, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend and Manchester City and England skipper Steph Houghton for talking frankly about their own mental health and the state of play in football more generally.Beckham, in particular, yields great influence. Hearing him talk about the effects of being vilied and abused by fans after he was red-carded against Argentina in the  World Cup was very powerful.“When I look back on it now, I didn’t realise how hard it was,” he says. “The times I’ve faced adversity throughout my career – and ’ was by far the toughest – did I feel OK to go to someone and say I needed help  No. I felt I had to keep it all in and deal with it myself.“Now I’m preaching to my kids and to other kids that it’s really important to talk. It’s OK not to be OK and it’s OK to say that. It’s OK to come out and say, ‘I need help’.”Let’s hope young men everywhere take that on board and realise it’s good to talk.People with a negative outlook about the present or future die two years earlier than the average person, according to new research.According to the Aussie team that did the research, from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, one reason for this might be that pessimists do not look after themselves as well, which has an impact on their health.The world is half-full of pessimists . . . or half-empty, depending on how you look at it. But the bottom line is that a positive mind and spirit equal positive outcomes, while a negative mind and spirit equal negative outcomes.So let’s all start looking on the bright side, shall we  Good. I am SO glad we had this chat.HEARING what it takes for models to look the way they do is always interesting.And by “interesting”, I mean it gives us a helpful reminder of how unrealistic expectations can be for women over their appearance.Brazilian model Vanusa Freitas,  – who clearly DOES look amazing – has shared the secret of how she looks the way she does.In preparation for a Playboy Portugal shoot, Vanusa exercised for eight hours a day and ate only egg whites.She said she was inspired by Kim Kardashian, which perhaps gave her the necessary discipline to deny herself food and, by the sound of things, time to do much  but work out.If spending the day in the gym and eating only egg whites is what is required to look like her, well . . . frankly, I’d rather have a le.Just reading the story made me feel sick.Roger Spackman, , was a Labour member of Exeter City Council until his arrest in  and worked at a secure children’s home.But the judge assessing his case this week decided Spackman would not himself commit abuse – so handed him only a suspended jail term.Yet the reality is that, by possessing these images, he is part of a cycle of horric abuse.Forty days of rehab is not going to change his desire to look at this kind of material.Time in prison would be a more fitting consequence – and perhaps some deterrent for the people who produce horric, disturbing images of children being harmed.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The social media expert says: Adele posing with arguably one of the most iconic girl groups of all time shows shes totally comfortable among these sexy s legends, and screams of independence and girl power!’ This is clearly a common theme post break-up.”The psychologist says: Fame brought the Spice Girls some insecurities which they have now conquered, like Adele.The V for victory sign is an acknowledgement of perhaps overcoming obstacles and freedom and liberation at last.The first real glimpse of the stars svelte new figure came courtesy of a fan, who bumped into her on a beach in the Caribbean resort of Anguilla in January.The newly single star was on a mates holiday with Harry Styles and James Corden, as well as son Angelo.The psychologist says: The picture of Adele alone indicates a freshness.Her body posture is relaxed and confident - revealing more of her body than before.The social media expert says: Yet another picture of Adele with a radiating smile is amazing to see, and clearly shows how content she is.I’m sure it’s no coincidence that there are so many images of her looking happy on her own.”There had been hints of weight loss before the singers birthday, in theCaribbean beach shot and at the Oscars a month later.But it was the birthday snap she posted in May, to thank her fans for their kind wishes, which broke the internet.The newly slim singer, who has dropped a huge seven stone by following a strict diet and working out with a personal trainer, posed outside her house in a black mini-dress and looked completely unrecognisable. The stylist says: Adeles style has shted from more of a formal look, with glamorous, long sweeping gowns, to shorter, more figure-hugging dresses.Each outfit - before and after her weight change - has been carefully selected to suit her shape and colour tone.The psychologist says: This is a stunning picture of Adele where she looks younger with longer hair, happier, with a completely dferent style of dress.  She no longer hides her body, but shows of her slimmer one with great pins.  It says this is a dferent and more confident me.The social media expert says: If social media is good for anything it is shouting about body positivity and Adele is no dferent, despite her normally-subdued social media output. The nature of the pictures and the increase in her social media activity is testament to how clearly proud Adele is of her new look, which will no doubt increase her popularity, as body-confident celebrities are often lauded by the public.”The Skyfall singer looked every inch the Bond girl as she celebrated her birthday with pal Nicole Richie in May.Although taken around the same time, the sexy, smouldering look, glamorous up do and figure-hugging mini were a stark contrast to the smiling girl-next-door in the weight loss reveal pic.The social media expert says: “Single le may have been just the tonic to help Adele begin to love herself again, and her pictures show – or at least portray – that she is happy without her ex.Posting pictures of how glowing and healthy you are following a break-up is a sure-fire way to show that you are prospering.The psychologist says: A split can often result in major weight loss or gain, and in Adele’s case it has had a positive impact.It has boosted her self-image and self-esteem and transformed this natural beauty into an exotic, sexy superstar. To match her weight loss, the singer has also changed her wardrobe from long dresses to figure-hugging dresses. She oozes sexuality and looks at peace with herself – bringing more adoration from her fans.Like proud slimmers when they climb into an oversized pair of their old trousers, Adele couldnt resist digging out her iconic beaded Glastonbury dress during a lockdown reshowing of her set.The post was a timely reminder of how much weight she had managed to lose since that  gig.The stylist says: By wearing the outfit she wore to perform at Glastonbury, I think the message to her fans is that shes still the same talented and likeable person they fell in love with all those years ago.Shes confident and happy, always looks immaculate - and women will always love her.The psychologist says: Donning an iconic dress from the past is a reminder of what she was... but now where is heading.  Divorce for anyone is traumatic and depressing, but for Adele it spelt a change from a mental and physical perspective and shes confronting both aspects head-on.Fans of the Chasing Pavements star are used to seeing her glammed up to the nines, with heavy eye make-up and fabulous clothes.So this recent snap of her relaxing at home in her sweatpants and T-shirt, make-up free, was a refreshing insight into the off-duty Adele.The caption on the picture - five ciders in - was a typically down to earth message that shes still one of us. The psychologist says: Again, Adele is revealing her self-assurance.This totally natural look and pose is revealing... no props, just a picture of some at ease with herself.The singers latest post showcased a new curly style and a slap-free face, as she posed in front of artwork for Beyonces album Black is King.The psychologist says: This shows Adele with a natural angelic face.She is going back to reality and naturalness revealing a new confidence in herself and shes stripped herself of all articial aid of make-up.  How many of us would go without make-up   This picture certainly shows that Adele is in a dferent mode in her le.  And its a change for the good.The social media expert says: While the frequent and dramatic hair changes could be down to something as simple as playing with styles or even lockdown boredom, this sort of thing is common in break-ups, particularly when it comes to posting on social media. Hair colour is something you have complete control over, so to change it dramatically shows that you have that control. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But one of the authors Chris Bonnell, a professor of public health and LSHTM said the Government current system only had about  per cent coverage. He said: Our findings suggests that it might be possiblea secondary epidemic wave in the UK,enough people with symptomatic infection can be diagnosed and their contacts traced and effectively isolated.Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolatingstrategy could result in a second wave.A second wave could be between . times worse than the first spike in infections - and could hit the UK by December, the study said. Based on the current number of people being tracked down by the test and trace system the study said further relaxing - including reopening schools - is likely to induce a second wave that would peak in December schools open full-time in September. The model assumes that around % of people wouldto workplaces once their children ed to school. The would mean there could be up to a % increase of mixing within the community.Dr Jasmina Panovska-Grfiths, senior research fellow and lecturer in mathematical modelling, at the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL, added: Our result show that reopening schools fully in September will not lead to a second waveaccompanied by a comprehensive test, trace and isolate strategy.Despite the warnings the PM has vowed to get all kids back in school after warnings there could be an entire lost generation of students who fall behind because of school closures. The study warned that although school closures did cut down on community transmission there could be massive harm to kids and parentsthey stayed shut.It said: These harms include hampering health-care and other key workers ability to go to work reduced economic productivity and damage to children and young peoples education, development, and physical and mental health arising from social isolation, reduced social support, and possible increased exposure to violence at home.A separate study on schools in Australia showed kids were much less likely to get ill with coronavirus or pass it on to teachers.Data from  schools and  nurseries showed that although  children or teachers went to school or nursery with coronavirus, only an additional  people later became infected.The warnings about getting an effective track  trace system comes after Blackburn with Darwen introduced their own local tracing services because of national failures. The number of contacts being hunted down by the national tracing services has been falling. Last week, almost , close contacts were missed by contact traces - or  per cent of people - compared with  per cent the week before that.Warnings about a second wave have also grown stronger as the national case count rose to  yesterday - compared with around  cases last Monday.

But experts at a Sage meeting last month, chaired by chief scientic advisor Sir Patrick Vallance found there was enough evidence to allow people who have already tested positive to skip self-isolatethey get sick again, according to The i newspaper.The experts saidsomeone has tested positive with a coronavirus swab test and an antibody tests, which showsyoure previously been infected they are must less likely to be infectious.They added: “This offers a way forward for releasing iniduals from self-isolation or quarantine.”The recommendation bolsters evidence in favour of the idea of immunity passports floated by ministers. It could mean people who have recovered from coronavirus would not have to obey social distancing and get back to their normal lives - eventhey show symptoms again. Although the evidence Sage looked at is promising - they have warned it would be too soon to allow those rules to be brought. Minutes from the meeting said: Sage advised that, based on current understanding, it would be premature to introduce immunity passports, but it advised that use of antibody positivity for short-term decisions may be possible.The findings are based on a paper from Wendy Barclay and Peter Openshaw of Imperial College. Based on animal experiments the scientists found evenpeople are reinfected with coronavirus their symptoms will probably be much less extreme. A Whitehall source said a shortage of tests poses a problem for so-called immunity passports. Those who have tested positive for antibodies by tests made available for private purchase are not reliable enough for ministers to make decision on. But the Government is hoping to make the higher-accuracy tests widely available in the coming months. One of the biggest studies on immunity to coronavirus in the UK unearthed worrying evidence showing resistance to the disease could disappear after only a few months evenpeople do develop antibodies. The Department for Health said: “We are always looking at and guided by the latest scientic advice. This is a new disease and how the immune system responds following infection with the virus remains uncertain. We are undertaking some of the largest studies in the world to assess the strength and duration of immunity, including monitoring the number of people presenting with an antibody response and how this changes over time.”  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I find these things, put my gloves on, took it out and rinse it, and put it in Ms. Maxwells closet… because I knew thats where they were kept.”The former butler said he also saw a “shiny black costume” in the closet that he believed was used for sex.Maxwell has always denied any involvement or knowledge of her close friends sex abuse, and is pleading not guilty to current child sex trafficking charges filed against her in New York.Previously released court documents in Giuffres case show the late pedophile bought books on sadomasochism.Filings showed an Amazon receipt listing titles including SM : A Realistic Introduction, SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude, and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and Their Owners.Shawna Rivera claimed she was just  when the perverted financier told her to pinch his nipples while he masturbated during a massage he hired her for.“[Epstein] wanted me to rub the lotion we were using all over his chest,” she said during Netflixs Epstein documentary Filthy Rich.“And he told me to just grab his nipples and squeeze and pinch as hard as I could.”“I was like, What the f**k is this  Im  years old.”It just went on like that for a couple of minutes and he finished. I was so embarrassed. I didnt know how to say, ‘’No, I dont want to do that’’.”Another alleged victim, Johanna Sjoberg, claimed that Epstein told her he needed “three orgasms a day.”In a previously unsealed deposition from Giuffres  defamation lawsuit, she said: “It was biological, like eating.”Workers at his mansions in New York, Florida and New Mexico have claimed the walls were adorned with erotic pictures of naked women.A former IT worker claimed Epstein kept a  ft naked portrait of Maxwell posing provocatively above the pool at his New Mexico ranch.The employee, who worked on “internet, security and communications” for Epstein from  to , told The Sun: “There was this huge painting of Ghislaine naked with her legs open, six foot by six foot.”“She was on a chair, leaning back, with her legs open.”“You could see everything. She would definitely have posed for that. It was in the basement by the pool.”In documents unsealed on Thursday, Giuffre told her lawyers that Epstein had a proclivity only for white girls.In the  interview, attorney Jack Scarola asked what criteria the late financier gave Giuffre to recruit other underage girls for his sex massages.“He asked: “What instructions were you given about what to look for ”Giuffre responded: “Young, pretty, you know, a fun personality. They couldnt be black.”“If they were any other descent other than white, they had to be exotically beautul. That was just about it.”Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges at a federal prison in Manhattan when he was found hanged on the morning of August  last year.An autopsy revealed he had a fracture to his neck and New York’s chief medical examiner Dr Barbara Sampson concluded the death was a suicide.Meanwhile victims fear that Ghislaine Maxwell, , who is being held in a Brooklyn jail on charges regarding her part in Epstein’s sex trafficking, could die before she faces justice. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A group of trade unions and womenaposs charities accused the Government of minimising violence against women and girls by allowing the unidentied ex-minister to keep the Tory whip and to remain in Parliament. More than two years on from the Westminster sexual harassment scandal, the group said it was deeply concerning that abuse was still occurring in Parliament. The joint statement – issued by the TUC, Centenary Action Group, the Fawcett Society, Women’s Aid and unions representing parliamentary staff– said: Given the seriousness of the allegations we’re calling on Parliament to suspend the MP arrested on suspicion of rape, pending a full investigation. The House of Commons should be no dferent from any other workplace. Safety and the safeguarding of staff must be paramount. Failure to suspend is yet another example of minimising violence against women and girls and failure to believe victims and survivors when they bravely speak out.  The group said it was deeply concerning that Parliament was not always a safe place for women to work - more than two years on from the wave of sexual harassment allegations which rocked Westminster in . They added: Parliament has made signicant progress in introducing a fully independent procedure for complaints, with the final stage voted on in June this year.  However, this case clearly shows that party politics is still interfering in justice and fairness. The intervention will heap further pressure on the Tories to act amid a furious backlash over why the MP remains in the party. The politician, who is in his s, was arrested on Saturday after the woman in her s alleged she had been assaulted four times, including a rape so traumatic that she sought hospital treatment. The MP has since been released on bail and denies the allegations.The alleged victim, who cannot be identied, said the MP should be named, insisting that this would not jeopardise her anonymity. Tory Chief Whip Mark Spencer said he did not want to do anything that risked identying the victim when faced with questions about why the senior MP remains in the party. But the alleged victim told friends she did not believe that suspending and naming a high profile MP would jeopardise her anonymity. According to the , she told a friend: “His defence today that he can’t name the MP because it would identy me is rubbish. I didn’t work for this MP and in any case I have lelong anonymity so there is no risk of me being ‘outed’ in the press.”  Mr Spencer - who is responsible for party discipline - has come under sustained pressure over his failure to suspend the MP. It also emerged that he had met the woman in April to discuss her concerns - months before the MP was arrested. However sources close to the Chief Whip said he was not informed about allegations of sexual abuse. He defended his actions on Monday, saying: “They are very serious allegations and we do take those allegations very seriously. I think it is down to the police to do that thorough investigation, not for the whips’ office to investigate this alleged crime, it is for the police and the authorities to do that. “Once they’ve come to that conclusion, then we can assess where we’re at and the position that the MP finds themselves in. Of course, we’ve got to bear in mind the victim."},{"url":null,"title":"eat out help out rishi","story":"NewsopinionEat Out to Help Out  Dont mindyou do, RishiState subsidies for junk food wont end the pandemic or save the hospitality sector, says Fleet Street Fox.

Rishi Sunak reveals a plan to give discounts for food. Great, grin all the Tories, for whom aposSoviet-style state food subsidiesapos is a phrase they utter only at election time, and about someone . What are we going to call it Um, says Rishi. We tried New Deal Meals, but itaposs a bit clumsy. We tried Meal Deal, but apparently thataposs been taken. Boris said I couldnapost have Rishiaposs Dishes. So after checking it couldnapost possibly refer to anything , weaposve decided to go with Eat Out to Help Out.Oh, thataposs catchy, say the Cabinet, for whom the concept of oral pleasure is linked firmly to Jacob Rees-Mogg saying sesquipedalian gobbledegook in a Brexit debate. And so here we are, in a topsy-turvy world in which a government of gammon are encouraging people to be, shall we say, signicantly kinder to their ladies than any of us imagine the Cabinet might ever have been.Little do these men, who have given so few gts for so long, realise it, but were anyone to follow their latest instruction to the letter it might actually ease the pandemic a bit. Some researchers have claimed that oral sex can improve levels of stress-reducing oxytocin, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA, which is used to make sex hormones and can boost the immune system. Both might have some impact on heart disease and some cancers, too, which means you really can Eat Out, Protect the NHS, And Save Lives. These hormones usually peak in our s, so encouraging their production in middle or later years certainly wouldnapost hurt. Perhaps it would even convince some of the over-s angry about their suggested quarantine that it has its benefits. But wait. What am I saying  As soon as anything that might help the ladies is suggested, a man is bound to point out vaginas cause mouth cancer, and claim itaposs just another way of finishing off the male race.They wonapost care that the risk is tiny, increased a lot by smoking, and penises can pass on cancer-causing STIs too. Donapost letaposs interrupt their important business of talking themselves out of having more, or indeed any, sex.  Because more than anything , the act of giving can only improve those who, much like the Cabinet, have never given much of anything. Itaposs called the aposHelperaposs Highapos - a natural reward system hard-wired into our brains. Acts of kindness, compassion and altruism create a burst of endorphins that lower stress levels, improve self-worth and mental health, and have proven over time to even increase lespan. Itaposs an evolutionary tweak that ensures the survival of those who help others, and thereby improve their own lives too.You donapost get that bump just by going to work, having a child, or coming up with a £bn test and trace system that only half works. Itaposs no good, for example, to eventually come round to the idea of wearing a mask, or to order people to eat in a restaurant and consider youaposve done your bit for society.The endorphins donapost comeyou call it a muzzle, advise people to just get sick and stop moaning, or put your mateaposs right to make millions over the rights of millions not to die before their time. Those people may be rich, or in positions of power, but they all suffer endorphin poverty, and theyaposre easy to spot.  According to the government website which tells me where, in the nearest  miles, my meals will be discounted, Rishi will pay for part of my food at two local pubs, the second-best Indian takeaway, a truck stop greasy spoon, a farmshop, a garden centre cafe, and a winery.But seeing as his boss is busily telling us Covid- is having a resurgence, and itaposs still an incurable disease, Iaposll probably pass. A tenner off in any of those places does nothing to reduce whatever risk there is, and will probably increase my taxes in the years to come by hundreds every year. Unless everyone does it, staff will still get laid off. The sums donapost really add up. But letaposs be honest - Rishiaposs dishes are no more about helping minimum-wage waiters than they are about making himself look, well, giving. Every pound he promises sends his popularity soaring in inverse proportion to that of Boris Johnson, whose negative ratings plummet further with his every pronouncement. Neither of them are feeling the Helperaposs High. Those in government seemed to have framed the pandemic in terms only of what it can get them - closer to power, contracts for contacts, or a buff to the reputation.Making coronavirus about the inidual is the best way of letting it win. Saying masks are optional, because they wonapost be enforced, or that a corporate raideraposs right to a idend trumps that of others to reduce their risk, puts one person above others. And with this disease, the normal hierarchy is reversed - the poorest and sickest are at the front of the queue.The only response to that is collective. Because everyone  is in the queue, too, and when the poorest and sickest are gone itaposll be the less poor, and less sick, next time. It is only by protecting someone  that we are protected ourselves, only the NHS that has done enough, so far, to save us, and only reducing the risks for others that minimises our own."},{"url":null,"title":"john hume family former sdlp","story":"NewsJohn Hume: Family of former SDLP leader ask mourners to light a candle in his honourThe Nobel Peace Prize Winner, who was a key architect of the Good Friday Agreement, died on Monday after a long battle with dementiaShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  AUG NewsTributes have poured in to former SDLP leader John Hume, who died on Monday \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In the latest report, the independent commission found that a fth of employees in deep poverty before coronavirus said they had since lost their jobs, compared to % of adults more than % above the poverty line. More than a thirdof people at least % below the poverty line had been affected, compared to % of those more than % above the poverty line.

In the rush of excitement, Mr Hancock forgot to buy six-year-old ginger tom Shortcakeaposs food so the pet ended up with ham later that evening. Explaining why Shortcake had put on weight, Mrs Hancock said: Itaposs because weaposre at home so much. Before, we were out the house a lot of the time so he was out - but now, because of the lockdown, weaposve been at home and every time Andy stands up the cat goes to his bowl. He has his normal food, Mr Hancock said. He likes Felix. The couple, who live near Mansfield, Notts, said they had to cut Shortcakeaposs diet down from four pouches after hearing a family member fed their cat only one a day.

Mr Hancock said: We had a couple of holidays planned prior to May time - Cyprus and Barcelona with friends - but we also had tickets for the Olympics in Tokyo. We were then going to fly from Tokyo to Bali, because thataposs where we had our honeymoon, and then we were going to Darwin at the top of Australia and then further down into Western Australia. The couple, who sold their catering business after their jackpot win, said they wanted to take their son to the Olympics because he was a keen Judo fan.  Mrs Hancock added: We were feeling a little bit down so we just thought, letaposs go and make the most of it - thereaposs lots of lovely places here to go and see and we can do day trips. Weaposve booked for Coniston Water in the Lake District, weaposre going to go to Great Yarmouth or around that area, and weaposre doing Harrogate next. During lockdown, the couple bought a pizza oven to make pizzas for their street to keep spirits high.  Everybody was still quite scared and we were all clapping every Thursday, Mrs Hancock said. We just wanted to do something nice so we sent out leaflets saying aposweaposre going to come and bring you a pizzaapos and it was lovely. It was around  pizzas I think.

Andy Calvert has been in the same spot outside a house in Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, occupied by Cameron Weir, , and his mum Sheila, . Cameron and Sheila claim a wood burner used by the -year-old ex-soldier causes fumes to pour into their house and back garden. It was originally thought that the council was powerless to intervene because the van sat on an unadopted road, reports the Daily Record. The family have now been informed by the local authority that it does own the land. However, officials say due to  Covid- restrictions  they can’t monitor the site to determineAndy is causing a nuisance. Cameron said: “For so long we were told it was an unadopted road that the council didn’t own. “The council have finally admitted that it is theirs and they have the authority to move Andy. “Then we were told they couldn’t act because of the  Covid restrictions  – but they could have acted long before now. “It’s incredibly frustrating.” Andy, who has been parked in his spot since August , blamed the council for his  housing issues  and said he would not be moving. He added: “This started when the council evicted me from my flat because I fell behind on rent.I had nowhere to go but my van.  “I have nothing against Cameron or Sheila. “ButI take a flat the council offer, I’ll be back to square one with all the outstanding arrears from the last flat to pay.So until the council can offer me help, I’m not going anywhere.” Long-distance lorry driver Andy has kitted out his van with a double bed, a TV, a fridge and wood ling for insulation. He uses a gas ring to cook, has a chemical toilet and showers at work.

Caring Kate, , joined volunteers to unload a van of donations for needy families at a baby bank in Sheffield. She later told how she broke down after hearing how some families had battled at the start of lockdown. Kate has launched a drive to get retailers and brands to donate items to more than  baby banks across the UK. The duchessapos tour of Baby Basics UK in South Yorkshire highlighted her efforts spearheading a donation drive which has seen shops like John Lewis, Marks  Spencer, Sainsburyaposs and Tesco give more than , new goods to baby banks across the country. During the event, Kate put on a floral face mask, a move which shows how the monarchy are adhering to coronavirus guidelines like the rest of the country. The Duchess of Cornwall recently wore a face covering during a visit to the National Gallery in London, and the Prince of Wales has joked about being given tartan masks. Commenting on how she cried after ing home from the baby bank visit, Kate said: It can get very emotional. I remember a couple of the families I met from Kingaposs Lynn and I went home and literally burst into tears, their stories were so moving. The struggles they have gone through, the bravery they have shown ... in extraordinary circumstances. Helping their families through extraordinary times.Baby banks have proved to be a leline for many parents during the coronavirus crisis, but have found their services under increasing pressure due to demand and because they cannot accept second hand donations.  Hearing of this, Kate - who has also previously visited Baby Basics in West Norfolk - decided to seeshe could help and has encouraged donations from  brands and high street retailers to Baby Basics, Little Village and AberNecessities, who operate baby banks across the UK. Their workforce is primarily volunteers and they receive referrals from services like health visitors, midwives and social workers. Kate helped unpack donations including clothes and toys during her visit to Baby Basics UK in Sheffield, before talking to parents about how baby banks have provided them with invaluable support when they have needed it most. Cat Ross, chief executive officer of Baby Basics, told the duchess: Often in a world where there is a lot of judgment and stereotyping about being poor, that additional stress can be even more dficult for parents who are doing amazing things to keep their families going with such strength, such determination. Kate replied: Yes, one of the mums I met was a nurse. These are families who do fantastic jobs and even they are struggling. All of the research shows how vital things like this are for them and that they are being recognised. The duchess talked atabout the future impact of Covid-, particularly for children. Itaposs dficult for sure but there is a lot of fearworry about when furlough ends and what it means for families, said Ms Ross.  But one of the positives to come out of it is the strength of communities across the UK and people wanting to help, volunteering and wanting to provide for each other. Organisations like us want to harvest that and it keep it going as much as possible. At the height of the lockdown, Kateaposs children were pictured joining in with the weekly applause for carers and delivering food to the vulnerable on the Queenaposs Sandringham estate.

During her short stint in the royal family, Meghan became known for her messy bun - a very dferent look than we were used to seeing from members of The Firm. While she often did her own hair and make up, hairdresser George Northwood was by her side during her time in the royal spotlight - and heaposs now given his thoughts on her new do. He believes her new hair is a her making a statement about how sheaposs started a new chapter in her le - and highlights that she no longer has to follow protocol. He told the : Sheaposs making a statement with hair that long - it represents strength and a sense that sheaposs really got everything sorted. This straighter, longer hairstyle marks a new chapter in her le without such strict protocols. While many people believe sheaposs had extensions put in, George says that isnapost the case and says itaposs all her real hair. Reflecting back on his time working with Meghan, he says they knew royal le meant things needed to be structured but they wanted something as relaxed as possible. He said: We decided to create a more undone look to balance out the formal dress code, often including soft tendrils that ultimately became her signature messy bun.  Whereas now, she can take a more relaxed approach to how she dresses, therefore this sleeker blow-dried hairstyle works beautully - itaposs casual but still polished and appropriate for her new le. Many royal fans believe her speech to the Girl Up  Leadership Summit also included several digs at her royal in-laws. In her pre-recorded message, which she filmed at her new LA home, where she has spent lockdown with Prince Harry and Archie, she referenced the treatment by “those in the corridors of power”. The -year-old said: I want to share something with you. “It’s that those in the halls and corridors and places of power, from lawmakers and world leaders to executives, all of those people, they depend on you more than you will ever depend on them. “And here’s the thing: they know this. “They know that all of you, at a younger age than any modern comparison, are setting the tone for an equitable humanity.

But before taking over the official royal account, Meghan had a page of her own - and it was very, very dferent. She filled her page with holiday snaps, bed selfies and cheeky jokes about her sex le. Like most fun-loving young women, Meghan regularly shared photos of her out and about with pals or enjoying some RR on trips to some of the most beautul parts of the world. There are also some very cheeky posts on her page, and weaposre not sure how the Queen would feel about them... Meghan used to love sharing photos of her dogs, and regularly posted snaps of her rescues - Guy and Bogart. She posted photos of her Canadian home, including some shots of her relaxing in bed.  And others are just general, very Instagram-friendly, snaps of her day-to-day live - and they all look a lot of fun. Self-confessed foodie Meghan also shared snaps of some of the delicious meals she tucked into - and the odd bottle of red wine, which she loves. She also shared a number of pictures which would, looking back, prove to have been a huge hint of her romance with Prince Harry long before they told the world they were in love. For Halloween, she shared a snap of her holding up a huge pumpkin while wearing an oversize cardigan.Itaposs believed Harry was visiting her when the snap was taken, and itaposs likely that he was behind the camera.  She also shared photos of her with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in which sheaposs wearing a blue and white beaded bracelet. This would later link her to Harry, who was spotted wearing a matching piece at an engagement around the same time. Meghanaposs blog The Tig was also hugely popular with fans, writing about everything from food and travel to her experiences of racism. Bizarrely, she also wrote her future sister-in-law, years before they even met.Like everyone  in the world, Meghan couldnapost escape royal wedding fever and back in  - three years after the Duke and Duchess of Camdbridgeaposs wedding - Meghan waded in to talk about princesses.She had a few things to say about grown womenaposs obsession with princesses.  In an interview with Princess Alia Al-Senussi, a descendant of Libyan royalty, in  she spoke about how society views princesses, reports Glamour magazine.She wrote: Little girls dream of being princesses. I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power. For those of you unfamiliar with the aposs cartoon reference, She-Ra is the twin sister of He-Man, and a sword-wielding royal rebel known for her strength. Weaposre definitely not talking about Cinderella here.

The couple spent the lockdown at Windsor Castle, but have now packed their bags and made the -mile trip to Balmoral for a sunny break. They were driven from Windsor to RAF Northolt in London this afternoon, where they then boarded a plane heading to the ,-acre Aberdeenshire estate, where they are expected to stay until at least September. The couple sat side by the side in the car, and the Queen had her trademark black handbag resting on her lap. They will be joined by whataposs been dubbed their aposBalmoral Bubbleapos, a small team of key staff who will look after them during their stay. It includes master of the household Vice-Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Queenaposs private secretary Sir Edward Young and Paul Whybrew and William Henderson, her pages. The Queen, , and her husband, , aways travel to the Scotland for their summer holiday, and are joined by other members of the royal families at dferent times. This is still expected to happen this year, however they will stay in separate buildings and all activities will be socially-distanced - for example, taking long walks. The Queen was whisked away from Buckingham Palace in mid-March, shortly before the UK was placed into lockdown and people were told not to leave their homes. Speaking at the time, a source said: She is in good health but it was thought best to move her. A lot of her staff are a bit panicky over coronavirus.“The Palace hosts a constant stream of visitors including politicians and dignitaries from around the world.  The Queen has met a lot of people there until recently. But she is weeks away from her th birthday and advisers believe it is best to get her out of harm’s way. “Buckingham Palace is in the middle of London and also has a bigger staff than other estates so is deemed a much more dangerous location. “There have been no specic scares or positive tests there yet but no one wants to take any chances.”Like the rest of the family, the Queen has been working from home during the lockdown and has carried out a number of engagements virtually. Sheaposs been taught how to use video calls in order to keep in touch with politicians and advisors. Sheaposs also delivered a speech to the public, offering support and comfort during the peak of the lockdown. She recorded the message in Windsor Castleaposs White Drawing Room, with just one camera operator who was dressed in full protective equipment.  She praised the NHS and other key workers for all they are doing at this dficult time, and thanked people who are staying home and not seeing their loved ones in a bid to stop the spread. She said that she hopes people will all look back at the crisis and take pride in how they responded to this challenge. Speaking about the pain many are feeling at being away from the people they love, she reflected on meeting evacuated children during the war.

Hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of casualties - which stands at at least ,, with  confirmed dead.  Exhausted firefighters continually move through the scenes of destruction, some searching for colleagues who had responded to an initial fire before the main blast.One officer told reporters not to take photos, adding: There are corpses everywhere - reports Channel News Asia.Members of the security forces reportedly broke down in tears when a colleague was brought to them dead on a stretcher.President Michel Aoun has recommended the city goes into a two-week state of emergency, with officials blaming tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored without proper health and safety measures in port warehouses.

The ad shows a little girl, leaning back against the front of the high-performance car, eating a banana. Alongside the picture were the words: Lets your heart beat faster – in every aspect. Social media users were quick to criticise the image branding it horrible and wrong on so many levels. For many the advert hit a little too close to home as they pointed out that the child was stood in a very dangerous place - in real le the driver of the car might not have been unable to see her. Others were concerned the girlaposs pose looked provocative.One person commented: With a top speed of mph this car should be illegal based on how many kids it will likely kill through both speed and contributory pollution. Instead you want to sell this car USING A CHILD  Probably Audiaposs lowest moment. Another replied: This is appalling, itaposs wrong on so many levels, and should be taken down immediately. This is a frightening image giving testimony to the fact that such enormous speed machines are a danger to our children and societies and do not belong on city streets with kids around. Makes my stomach turn just looking at it, tweeted a third. Jeremy Vine also shared his thoughts on the topic, saying it was the most revolting car advert he had ever seen. He posted: This is the most revolting car advert I have ever seen. It actually radiates danger.

The Audi RS  is a family car with more than thirty driver assistance systems including an emergency break system. That’s why we showcased it with ious family members for the campaign. We hoped we could convey these messages, showing that even for the weakest traffic participants it is possible to relaxingly lean on the RS technology. That was a mistake! Audi never intended to hurt anyone’s feelings. We sincerely apologize for this insensitive image and ensure that it will not be used in future. We will also immediately examine internally, how this campaign has been created andcontrol mechanisms failed in this case.

The players will know that. We were a wee bit loose when the ball got turned over and we get punished for that.”Mellon, having been round the course plenty of times both on and off the pitch in England, is shrewd enough a manager to know singling out “loose” players at this early stage of his tenure at Tannadice will do him no favours.Especially when, on Saturday, Lawrence Shankland was particularly worthy of the tag.United’s talisman was uncharacteristically quiet in the first half against Saints.Perth captain Jason Kerr was tasked with sticking to Shankland like glue and did so effectively, limiting the Tannadice hit man to a bit part in the game before the break.However, with United a goal and a man up after Michael O’Halloran’s sending off, last season’s top scorer emerged for the second half looking determined to make an impact in front of goal.Shankland’s keenness to open his top flight account was clear to see.Instead, after fluffing a couple of chances, the striker appeared to tire  minutes in and, with Saints in possession, clearly gave up on chasing possession from Saints’ Ali McCann, despite his manager’s audible encouragement from the technical area.With Shankland out of gas, McCann, unchallenged, found Kerr, who then found Danny McNamara, whose cross led to the botched Mark Connolly clearance lashed home by Liam Craig for the short-handed Perth side’s equaliser.Instructions were given by Micky Mellon. Instructions weren’t followed. A goal was coughed up.At this level – even against a weakened side – such things can be decisive.“Credit to St Johnstone, they dug in with  men and then we have to go and break down a block,” said the United boss.“We kept prodding and poking away at it but we just weren’t able to undo a packed block.“But we will learn our lessons and move on. That’s what it’s about, we are in a transition, we have moved up a ision.“There are a lot of players who are playing at this level again for the first time in a long time or playing for the first time, as well as having a -year-oldmaking his debut.“We will gather the positives and move on to training next week and be ready to move the club on again.”Victorious teams never talk about taking – or gathering – the positives from games.Instead, it tends to be a phrase beaten managers and players use to deflect from negatives.United weren’t beaten on Saturday but, at full time, a draw didn’t feel like a good result.Having played against  men for a full half, that’s understandable.But as the dust settles, the clearer it should become that there are plenty of reasons to be cheerful for the Tangerines.From kick-off until half time, United looked like a serious Premiership side. They were first to every ball. They were sharp, drilled and positive.Their movement was like clockwork. Their shape was well defined. They knew exactly what they were doing.There were issues – Shankland was far too quiet for somebody so potentially influential, while their second half performance was poor.But, as Micky Mellon said, it’s all about detail.The fact United fans can look at their side and say there are fine margins between the point they won on day one and the three they will be looking for next weekend against Motherwell ought to be heartening.The Tangerines, as a club, are back where they belong.If they can replicate their first half performance against Saints, they’ll soon be picking up the wins that will help them stay there.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

The past few months have reminded us of what really matters our health. We all have things we’d like to improve, whether that’s losing weight or getting more physically active. Here is some advice on how to take advantage of the great outdoors and get the whole family fit this summer.The summer months offer us all the perfect opportunity to make changes to improve our mental and physical health. Getting active is good for your body and mind, and there are lots of easy ways to get active. Taking a brisk walk every day will help shed the pounds, but there is nothing better than heading out into the great outdoors to take in some of the wonderful countryside and coastal sites close to home. There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

that this council has ever had to face.ldquoThe pressures on our staff and resources have been immense, the impact will be felt for years and will not be fully known for some time.ldquoThroughout this pandemic the officers of this council have had to take very swt decisions and react quickly to government guidance and I want to thank them for the efforts that they have made to fully consult with councillors all the way along.ldquoI also want to thank councillor Stuart Bell who has worked collegiately with myself throughout this situation to ensure that all councillors have felt fully engaged in any decisions that have been made.ldquoI want to thank the officers, staff and partners of the council for their incredible work over the last five months to respond to this ever changing situation that we have found ourselves in.ldquoBut I also want to particularly mention all of the incredible community volunteers, resilient community groups and COVID- response groups who have done so much in our community.ldquoThe level of community engagement and co-working with council services has been amazing to see and this is something that we must hold onto, and learn from for the future.Fellow

to continue making planning decisions,there remains a backlog of deferred decisions, and the financial consequencesof the lockdown are signicant and growing ndash whilst the same problem isfacing other local authorities, that doesnrsquot make it easier to address.ldquoI tried to give a message of hope in March and whilst there is more to hopefor there is now no less uncertainty.ldquoIt is estimated that only five per cent of the Scottish population has actually had COVID- which means that the best that almost all of us can hope, is that we maypersonally not be susceptible to a devastating infection that is all around us.ldquoThat is why in thanking the council staff for their application and flexibility, andalso thanking the general public for their forbearance, I

responsibility for reducing danger onto drivers is among proposals announced as part of a Department for Transport consultation on updating the road usersrsquo hand book.What other changes are set to be made The planned updates also include:Announcing the consultation, the DfT explained: \"[The hierarchy of road users] ensures that those road users who can do the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the danger or threat they may pose to other road users.\"The objective of the hierarchy is not to give priority to pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders in every situation, but rather to ensure a more mutually respectful and considerate culture of safe and effective road use that benefits all users.This principle, it added: ldquoapplies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, followed by vans minibuses, cars taxis and motorcycles.The other major changes include rules to create clearer and stronger priorities for pedestrians, particularly at junctions, and clary where pedestrians have right of way.This will include recommending cars and bikes turning into or out of side roads give way to pedestrians waiting to cross.The third major point of the updates will place a requirement on drivers to give priority to cyclists when they are turning into or out of a junction, or changing direction or lane, just as they would to other motor vehicles.Specic guidance for drivers sets out the speeds and distances drivers should observe when passin cyclists and horse riders.The new text says drivers passing cyclists should leave a gap of at least . metres at speeds under mph and at least two metres at more than mph.It also says they should not pass horses at more than mph and with a gap of at least two metres.The updated Code will also recommend drivers adopt the ldquoDutch reach method of getting out of a car.This means using the hand furthest from the door to pull the handle, which forces you to twist your body, making it more likely yoursquoll see a cyclist approaching from behind.EV drivers will also be warned to ensure charging cables do not present a trip hazard for pedestrians and new guidance will highlight the growing use of blanket mph zones in place of the standard mph limit in urban areas.What has the reaction been to the planned changes The RAC said it broadly welcomed the proposed changes but said the right-of-way changes needed clarication for everybodys safety.RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: \"Overall the ambition behind the proposed Highway Code changes is to make the roads safer for everyone.\"A part of that is making it crystal clear we all have a shared responsibility to ensure one anotherrsquos safety on the road, whether you are travelling on foot, on a bicycle or in a motor vehicle.\"Many other changes made to the Code, such as recommending the lsquoDutch reachrsquo when exiting a vehicle to check for cyclists and taking care when charging electric vehicles, are also very sound.ldquoWe also welcome the new guidance contained in the Code on the safe passing of roadside workers.\"Every day, our patrols and recovery workers put themselves at risk to help others and the more that can be done to protect them, the safer that job becomes.ldquoItrsquos vital now that every final change made to the Code is well communicated.\"While drivers should keep up with changes to the Highway Code, our research suggests only half have consulted it at any time in the last  years."},{"url":null,"title":"campers-vandalism-beauty-spot-slammed","story":"The shocking

Larkin, who was born in Coventry in  and died in Hull in , was a quintessentially English poet. At a time when international travel became routine he revelled in going nowhere. England made him and by and large held him under its spell. Interviewed for the Observer, he said he wouldnrsquot mind visiting China as long as he couldthe same day.Vacations were spent in the north of England or Scotland, whose landscape he loved and whose poets ndash especially Hugh MacDiarmid ndash he didnrsquot rate. In the mid-s the Larkins holidayed in Germany where his father Sydney, an anti-semite, felt very much at home. Sydney, who worked in local government, was also an admirer of Hitler and kept a statue of him on his mantelpiece reproducing a Nazi salute. Think Basil Fawlty and yoursquore on the right track.His loving son was no fan of Hitler and he was no anti-semite. His attitude to race, however, is complex to say the least, and best considered through the medium of jazz. For him, the music was at its most potent, hypnotic and enjoyable in its infancy when Louis Armstrong, the great crowd pleaser, was in his pomp. But along came the likes of Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Charles Mingus who refused to pander to the stereotype of the black man entertaining whites. Larkin felt that what emanated from them was more than his ear could stand and he used his jazz column in the Dailyto explain why. ldquoItrsquos about time, he told one correspondent, ldquojazz had its Enoch Powell.Then there are the women. For a man who looked more like Eric Morecambe than Sean Connery, Larkinrsquos success rate offers hope to the bald, beer-bellied and bespectacled. He never married but was rarely short of a female companion, and was adept at stringing several women along simultaneously. Some have accused him of misogyny Irsquod suggest a verdict of not proven. But he did have a fondness for smutty jokes and was a keen collector of pornography, albeit of the sort that wouldnrsquot raise an eyebrow nowadays.Then there is his poetry which resonates still. No other modern English poet is so frequently quoted or invoked. Quite rightly he was offered the poet laureateship, but declined. Imagine the hullabaloohe was presently in post and his views on race, women and politicsbecame public.This edition of Larkinrsquos Collected Poems is remarkable not for the poems, which his fans must already have and know, but for the inclusion of a selection of his photographs, some of which have not been published previously.In his foreword, Andrew Motion notes that Larkin was a ldquocommitted amateur photographer who took his hobby seriously, but he was no Cartier-Bresson. Just  photographs are included which seems meagre. Their subject matter echoes that of his poetry: gravestones in a cemetery, cranes at Hull docks, the Larkin family on a beach the summer war broke out.Other photos are of two of his lovers ndash Monica Jones posing in a bathing costume, Maeve Brennan ldquoseen through reeds in a field ndash and of Larkin himself in his bachelor pad. The final one is of him leaning on a chair. Sitting in it is his mother who is wearing a floral dress and has in her lap a knitted rabbit. It was taken in the s. So glum and old and old-fashioned does Larkin look thatyou didnrsquot know otherwise yoursquod be forgiven for thinking that the pair were husband and we."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-preview-sensual-moving-daring-little-birds-feels-different-anything-else-tv","story":"\"They really affected me, and woke a sexual sort of fire that I didnt know I had\",\" notes the London-born star, who grew up in Somerset, and has been acting since she was a young teenager.Now,  years later, the quirky actress is playing the lead role - New York heiress Lucy Savage - in Sky Atlantics adaptation of Nins book.\"I made a lot of notes of little things that I wanted to add into the script, trying to get actual one-liner direct quotes from Little Birds, and I got a couple of them in there, which was really exciting,\" reflects Temple, star of films such as Atonement, St Trinians and Maleficent, plus Netflix series Dirty John.\"That was cool that everyone was open to me doing that.\"Little Birds is a six-part series, written by Sophia Al-Maria - an American-Qatari filmmaker and artist - and directed by Detroit-born Stacie Passon, whose previous projects include House Of Cards.When her husband Hugo does not greet her in the way she expected, she finds herself on a journey to freedom and independence.We see Lucy discovering the surprising, erse and degenerate world of Tangier, in Morocco, a country quivering on the cusp of independence. Along the way, she meets a myriad of characters including a scandalous dominatrix, Chera Lamorwho particularly captures Lucys imagination.Seeing as the show is based on a volume of erotica, you can expect to see some bold sex scenes on screen, which look they could be quite awkward to film.Was there anything the cast drew a line under when it came to depicting characters in intimate situations \"I was very clear from the very beginning of what is allowed and what is not allowed,\" declares Marwan, who was born in Lebanon, but grew up in Beirut and then Iowa.\"Im still scared to this day, to right this second, for when Little Birds comes out, how many family members Im going to lose.\"It sounds like Marwan being quite jokey at first, but then she stresses: \"Its funny, but its not funny even though I made sure that I would never show my breasts or my ass or I would never be in a scene where Im having sex, its still like I did too much for what my family would expect from me.\"The production [team], the director, were very, very understanding... It just felt like any boundary that the actor would set during the scene was accepted immediately, which made me comfortable to be able to do the scene.\"\"Stacie has been quite attentive to any conversation we would want to have with her, related to any intimate scenes,\" follows Raphael Acloque, who portrays an Egyptian aristocrat named Adham Abaza.\"She was always available, whenever we needed to discuss anything about it.\"Hugh Skinner - known for shows such as Fleabag and WA - plays Hugo, who is not only trapped in a relationship with Lucy, who he doesnt love, but we also see trying to become an arms dealer.\"Its so hard because when you put it like that, he sounds dreadful,\" quips London native Skinner, .\"But there are a lot of external forces weighing down on him and, in that sense, hes a bit of an emotionally stunted pinball.\"But despite being gay and deciding to marry a woman, hes really lucked out with Lucy actually because she proves to be incredible.\"All the characters, theyre all sort of outsiders in a lot of ways, taking ownership of their otherness and transcending the situation, and hes lucky to be with Lucy as she finds liberation.\"This may be a period drama, but theres no denying that the themes will resonate with modern audiences.For example, the idea of people being desperate to shake off the shackles of society still very much exists today, I suggest.\"Yeah, I think power struggles will always exist and I think this show is all about people fighting for their own agency, or struggling for their own independence whether thats personally, or politically, thats always going to be relevant,\" -year-old Nina Sosanya, who plays eccentric entertainer Lili Von X, nods in agreement.\"Its going to have a wide audience, because its set in a particular period, but its a period thats incredibly attractive to us anyway, just visually,\" continues the Londoner, who starred alongside Skinner in WA, and is also known for BBC One drama Last Tango In Halax.\"And youre going to have people that have lived through those changes - a section of the audience that might sometimes be overlooked, which is the people that are older than us, -plus who have actually seen those changes, who have lived through the sexual revolution of the s...

It was great. It was also just an incredible learning experience.\"\"I always say that I am always surprised by how much we liked each other because Ive done so many projects with people that I absolutely hated,\" Marwan follows candidly.\"At the end of the day, its a job. But something about this felt dferent... This felt like a very, very special project where, for some reason, most of us felt very connected to each other.\"There was something about just all of us being there together that helped me a lot during the process of filming.\"\"Which makes it extra cruel we have to be doing press for this via Zoom, because of a pandemic!\" cries Temple. \"It really would be nice to be together to do this for real.\"Little Birds launches on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"town-country-five-best-places-find-beautiful-sunsets-scotland","story":"As the nights begin to get longer and the sun sets slightly earlier, do not miss the opportunity to catch an incredible Scottish sunset.

Organic beef, lamb, venison and pork from Butchery at Bowhouse, wholemeal organic flours from Scotland the Bread, organic vegetables and salads from East Neuk Market Garden, rums, ciders, beers and natural wines from Futtle Organic Brewery, game meats from Woodmill Game, cheeses from the neighbouring St Andrews Farmhouse Cheese Company, will all be featured.

We really feel like a family at Bowhouse, itrsquos home to a number of producers such as Scotland the Bread, Futtle Organic Brewery, The Butchery at Bowhouse and the East Neuk Market Garden who share resources as well as a hosting space for the market weekends. It gives us great pleasure to be able to welcome a collection day as a chance to experience Bowhouse in person and explore the amazing range of food and drink available from Fe.A box of delights from Bowhouse food hubSam Parsons, Balcaskie Estate Manager where Bowhouse is based, said that lockdown allowed them to focus specically on growing the online side of the business.ldquoAs lockdown was very sudden, we had to look at how do we change direction and quickly and how do we commit to how to making Bowhouse a food hub for people to come and collect from regularly, said Mr Parsons. ldquoMarkets are a great way to connect customers to producers, but we wanted to focus on fresh seasonal local produce and that doesnrsquot gel completely with once a month event.ldquoWe wanted to make it a more frequent event and we are happy to be a collection point and an aggregator for multiple producers. This landed at the right time for us and we could really focus on this.During lockdown shoppers saw their habits change due to travel restrictions and availability, which gave Bowhouse a chance to introduce itself to new people.Mr Parsons added: ldquoI think two things struck me very early on in lockdown. Meal times became social gatherings and cohesion between families. People became much more interested in their food and there seemed to be a lot of social media around it and families coming together. That was long overdue as we have all been guilty of grab what you can. Where the food came from and who produced it suddenly became important to people. I think local food distributors and producers showed resilience and became more important. I think people have remembered that food security - can we produce it, can we get it - now matters to them.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Vulnerable Scots ease into new normal as shielding comes to an endA weekly online collection, run through Open Food Network, started in lockdown and took the place of the monthly markets and this Saturday will be the first time people will be able to go back to a market environment.They will be running the usual weekly collection, with orders able to be placed between Monday and Wednesday, ready for collection in slots between am and am.

One of the businesses involved in the link East Neuk Market Gardens has a little plot near the market and before people lockdown people use to love to have wander and see where their food had been grown and picked and I think some people have missed that.Sophie Cumber, Butchery at Bowhouse, joined the team in February having moved from London.She said: ldquoOpening on the weekend of Lockdown, as you can imagine, a meat chill full of fantastic locally produced organic meat and no market to sell to ndash without Bowhouse Link, my business would never have survived the first few months.

They were subsequently offered testingthey developed possible symptoms.Five of the  secondary cases - three pupils and two adults - occurred in just three schools.In nine of the  nurseries where a case of Covid- was detected, there were no secondary infections at all.However, one nursery experienced a \"large outbreak\" resulting in the virus spreading to six adults and seven children - including three children under one who remained asymptomatic.The index case was initially identied as a two-year-old, but subsequent investigation traced the primary case to a staff member.It was unclear where they had picked up the infection, but the researchers stressed that this incident had occurred early on in the pandemic \"when the criteria for testing was more narrow\".: Why the common cold might protect you from Covid infectionThe study covered , primary and secondary schools and , nurseries for children aged six weeks to five years old across NSW from January  - when Australia reported its first Covid- case - to April , when term ended. Close contact follow-up was extended to May .Schools and nurseries remained open for most of the term, with physical distancing and enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures in place.After March , when the epidemic peaked, children were encouraged to stay home until term ended with online distance learning implemented.Schools remained open for pupils for whom home schooling was not an option, but the researchers note that this resulted in a drop in school attendance from  per cent to approximately %.The authors conclude: \"Sars-CoV- transmission rates were low in NSW educational settings during the first Covid- epidemic wave, consistent with mild infrequent disease in the middot million child [under-] population.\"With effective case-contact testing and epidemic management strategies and associated small numbers of attendances while infected, children and teachers did not contribute signicantly to Covid- transmission via attendance in educational settings.\": Scotland records third highest rate of excess deaths in Europe during pandemicThe study was led by Professor Kristine Macartney, a paediatrician specialising in infectious diseases and vaccinology at Sydney University and director of Australias National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance.She said: ldquoThe study adds valuable data, but it is important to view these findings in the context of the NSW outbreak.\"It may be that higher rates of transmission occur in areas with higher levels of infection and where contact tracing and public health measures were not as rigorous as in Australia, where borders were closed and quarantine measures were strongly enforced.It comes as modelling by the researchers at UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that a second wave of Covid would peak in in the UK in Decemberlevels of contact tracing and diagnoses fall below necessary thresholds after schools in England and Walesin September.Their modelling suggests a second wave might be avoided with increased testing.This should mean that between % and % people showing symptoms are tested at some point during active infection, with effective contact tracing and isolation also in place.The scenario is based on schools ing full-time in September and other lockdown measures having been eased, including more adults ing to work.If levels of diagnoses and contact tracing fall below this benchmark, a second wave would peak in December.If a part-time rota system were adopted for pupils ing to school in September, the second peak in Covid cases would be delayed until February.Dr Jasmina Panovska-Grfiths, who lead the study, said: ldquoOur modelling suggests that with a highly effective test and trace strategy in place across the UK, it is possible for schools to reopen safely in September.\"However, without sufficient coverage of a test-trace-isolate strategy the UK risks a serious second epidemic peak either in December or February.\"Therefore, we urge the government to ensure that test-trace-isolate capacity is scaled up to a sufficient level before schools reopen.Both studies are published today in the journal- fulltext\" rel\"nofollow\"Lancet Child  Adolescent Health."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-premiership-topped-premier-league-bundesliga-return-weekend","story":"Letrsquos be honest though, how many of you were actually that interested or did you just tune in to Augsburg vs Paderborn to get a football fix that had been absent for the best part of three months The Premier League comeback was met with increased interest in Scotland as punters actually had a relatively clued up understanding of the  players who were strutting their stuff on the park.Seeing Liverpool crowned champions was a welcome sight and the battle for relegation and Champions League spots also kept us entertained.But come on, nothing in Germany or England quite compared to theof the Scottish Premiership season did it I felt like a kid on Christmas Day waking up on Saturday morning.Aberdeen vs Rangers on the telly for starters, a trip to Tannadice for Dundee United vs St Johnstone as a main course, and Sportscenefor dessert.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was in an extremely privileged position to be able to go and watch a match in a stadium and I know thousands of others would have paid good money to be in my shoes. But it was just that sense of familiarity that was oh-so welcome.I would have happily handed over my pay-per-view fee to have Scottish football back on my TVI wasnrsquot in a position to go along to a game too.And going by the reaction of supporters on social media, screenings from across the country seemed to go down without any major hiccups.Of course there are going to be teething problems and it will probably take some of Scotlandrsquos top flight teams a few weeks before they are churning out industry standard streams ndash but remember these are unprecedented times for everyone.I have to tip my hat to Dundee United too. The Terrors were extremely well organised and made a potentially nerve wracking experience stress free for those of us who were lucky enough to take in their first game back in the Premiership.They would have loved the stands to be full of adoring supporters for the unfurling of the Championship winners flag, but with the stadium decorated in tangerine flags and supporter cutouts, they certainly made the best out of a bad situation.As much as it was great to be back at a live game, the lack of fans was the one big disappointment and I believe it certainly had an impact on those out on the pitch.United played against the  men of St Johnstone for the best part of  minutes on Saturday and threatened Elliott Parish in the Saints goal only once.If the stands had been packed with Tannadice followers urging their team on to attack, it could have quite easily been an opening day three points for Micky Mellonrsquos side.Therersquos talk of it being September before supporters are able toto their seats in stadiums across Scotland, albeit in reduced numbers.In my opinion this stage, with empty stadia, could have both positive and negative effects on teams.Dundee United, as previously mentioned, are a prime example of the way a lack of supporters can have a negative impact.But for a team like Rangers, I think an empty Ibrox for the opening period of the season could work as an advantage.Nobody can disagree that it takes a special player to perform week in week out in front of , and in recent seasons some Gers players have been guilty of finding that pressure too much.In contrast, having no one in the stands, players can focus fully on the job in hand ndash getting three points on the board week in week out.Consistency will grow confidence and when the time comes for supporters to make their way back through the Ibrox turnstiles, players should not find the weight of expectancy as heavy as usual.Only time will tellsupporter absence will play a key role in deciding where the title ends up this season, but letrsquos just take a minute to appreciate that our game is back.The league we love and adore, the teams we, in normal circumstances, would follow across the country every week are back on our screens.There was pressure on the Scottish game last weekend to get it right after a summer of squabbling between clubs and the SPFL about how the season was ended.It featured on our televisions and computer screens almost as much as the pandemic we are experiencing.But again I will reiterate, nobody has experienced anything like this before and cut-throat decisions had to be made.Those at the top got it right at the weekend and we must continue to showcase football in Scotland in the best possible way moving forward.The Scottish Premiership is one of the few leagues running at the moment and with an operational pay-per-view service and Sky Sports on our side - it is time to show the rest of Europe what we are all about.The talent is there and a captive audience is here now more than ever.You simply cannae beat it.

Why waste time on an already well-trodden patch of history when you can explore fresh angles The tale began in  with Batista fleeing to the USA and the ldquobearded men from the mountains taking over in Havana. One of Castrorsquos first acts was to go to Washington DC to talk friendship. Eisenhower would not receive him, so he made do with a meeting with the Vice-President, one Richard Nixon, who pronounced himself unimpressed by the commie rebel.It was the first in a series of intriguing ldquo onlys the film set up. If only Castro had met someone  on that first visit as leader. If only a later approach from Henry Kissinger had paid off. If only Fidel had not been Fidel. As Ricardo Alarcon, a veteran diplomat for the regime, said: ldquoFidel has only one defect ndash that he doesnrsquot know how to do anything by half measures.But Fidel was Fidel, and his Cuba was determined to go its own way, eventhe USSR had to pay its bills. If you had a liberation struggle and Cuba could help, it would. You could see why Castro was considered such a threat to the established world order .As in Inside Europe, the film had its box office draws, Bill Clinton among them, but this was history told by not so famous figures. From Soviet officials to White House advisers, these were some of the guys, and it was mostly guys, who were in the rooms when history happened.Time was given over to anecdotes that might have seemed insignicant at first pass, but turned out to say so much about the nature of Castro and his regime. There was the time Castro kept a visiting Algerian rebel leader waiting for a week, only to turn up to his hotel room at am and talk for two hours. Or the day the he told two American journalists that Peter Benchleyrsquos novel, Jaws, was ldquoa great example of capitalism because the Amity Island mayor kept the beach open to make money.There was a fair bit of familiar archive, with one shot of khaki-clad fighters walking through a jungle much like another, as well as the odd tired line .

Moreover, evenher followers are correct,she were to be hit by the proverbial bus, who would Scotland be left with The hopeless Humza Yousaf, with a conviction that makes him uniquely unfit to be either Transport or Justice Secretary  Or John Swinney, a husk of a man whose judgment is so poor on schools reopening that it had to be over-ruled within days  Likewise, Jeane Freeman, who shares the blame for Scotlandrsquos care home deaths and is apparently deemed incapable of representing her own policies at the daily televised NicolaFest  Or do we go back to sleazy Derek Mackay, the disgraced ex-heir apparent Or do we fall back on Alex Salmond, the man promoted and supported for decades by the very same Ms Sturgeon, whose conduct around women led to him being described in court by his own defence counsel as ldquonot a good man The First Ministerrsquos dominance is in fact a mark of how devolution has diminished Scottish politics ndash there is no doubt that she would have been reduced to a figure of ridicule by John Smith, or that Robin Cook would have torn her playhouse down, room by room by roomFurthermore, her threadbare party ndash the SNP ndash is symptomatic of the shallow talent pool that is Holyrood. She and they have no blueprint for a better future outside the UK, and we can have no confidence whatsoever that they could or would make an independent Scotland a better place.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.JOHN Findlay contends that Nicola Sturgeon has no confidence in allowing her Cabinet colleagues to deliver the daily Covid- update, but Mr Findlay would appear to have no confidence in the public, when he writes that \"convince a gullible public she has performed really well dealing with Covid- and that should be sufficient for them to vote for independence\". Mr Findlay goes on to state that many of the SNPs policies have failed since taking office. Presumably he also blames the gullible public for ing the SNP to Holyrood three consecutive times, andthe opinion polls are correct it will be back for a fourth term next May. However, I seem to recall that before the SNP came to power I had to pay over the counter for my medical prescriptions and pay to cross a bridge when visiting my friends in Fe. Amongst many other achievements, the SNP has provided baby boxes to help parents give their children a good start in le, extended quality childcare provision, upgraded nearly a thousand schools, provided free university education, built thousands of affordable homes for families, and provided free personal care when required, regardless of age.As for Mr Findlays contention that an independent Scotland would have no influence in the world compared to that of the UK, I would suggest that the UKs standing in the world has slumped due to leaving the European Union, a decision which was soundly rejected by Scotlands voters. And as for the influence an independent Scotland could have in Europe, Mr Findlay need look no further than Ireland, and the influence that country had, and the respect shown to it by the EU during the Brexit negotiations.Ruth Marr, Stirling.GR Weirrsquos characterisation of Ruth Davidson as ldquobovver boots made me laugh . This irreverent description of the ldquotank commander should not, however, cloud the fact that despite the forthcoming reprise of her cameo role as a stand in  stand-up in the Scottish Parliament she will soon be tightly ensconced in the House of Lords at considerable taxpayer expense.

In fact, every UK government in our letimes has knowingly erted tens of billions of pounds of Scottish revenues to Westminster.

But hersquos as hard as nails.

Irsquove known Douglas all his political le and he is exactly the candidate with the energy to lead that I had in mind.ldquoOur party should unite behind him and back him all the way.The SNP last night withdrew an attack on Mr Ross which claimed he had a ldquolong history of racist views.The party deleted the accusation from Twitter after an online backlash, although the SNP website still said he held ldquoabhorrent views.The attack was based on an interview Mr Ross gave as a new MP in  in which he said he would prioritise ldquotougher enforcement against Gypsy travellershe was PM for a day.He later apologised for the comment, saying he meant people who ldquoflout local planning procedures with illegal encampments.Mr Rossrsquos spokesman said it was ldquodisappointing that the SNP are choosing to stoop to this kind of thing.

Lennie  Co, Nearhouse, Tankerness.The five-year-old bull, named Pentland Emperor, was bought from Mrs E. C. Robertson, from Instack, Barrock Caithness. His sire was Chapelton Wildfire and he was out of Pentland Laura.The inter-breed cattle judge that year was John Elliot from Roxburgh Mains, Kelso, who said of the bull: “The bull was just a really good bull. I couldn#t see a fault in him and that#s the honest truth. He was a mature bull as well. It is very dficult to go past a mature animal at the end of the day.”The bull#s competition today is the champion of the  County Show, the -month-old Limousin cross heer, named Amelie. Exhibited by Liam Muir, from Upper Onston, Stenness, she was a homebred, from the French bull Tehix and out of a British Blue cross dam.The inter-breed cattle judge in  was Neil Massie of Blelack, Dinnet, Aboyne, # a pedigree Charolais, Aberdeen-Angus and Shorthorn breeder. He said that he wouldn#t normally have picked a cross-bred animal as the winner, but that she was “exceptional.”He said: “She is an extremely attractive heer, tremendous body on her, great , correct in every phase about the animal – I really couldn#t fault the animal at all.”Sheep Today#s sheep section sees two Cheviot champions judged against each other. First up, we have the winner of the  County Show winner. This was a Cheviot ewe exhibited by J. J.  E. Wishart, Newbigging, Harray.The ewe “did the double” for its owner Elsie Wishart, winning at that year#s Dounby Show before going on to win at the County the same year. A two-crop ewe, homebred, the ewe#s sire was Cairnside Northern Light and she was out of Barnaclaven Elite.John Aiken of Inglewood Edge, Dalston, had judged the ewe that year and said he found her an animal that “exemplied” its breed. He said: “When I saw the Cheviot I could see all the things I like to see. The Cheviot was animal who was able to show itself very well indeed.”The ewe#s competition today is the sheep champion from the  County Show. This was a gimmer, also shown by James and Elsie Wishart, from Newbigging, Harray.The  win was the first time since  that James and Elsie had claimed.

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The SQA then checked and validated the information received. According to the council, moderations to the results, up or down, have been made by the SQA,necessary, to ensure consistency across schools and colleges and consistency with results from previous years.Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC education, leisure and housing committee said that all had stepped up to the challenges set before them during these unprecedented times.“Never before have the exams been cancelled, so it has been a steep learning curve for all involved and we must acknowledge the efforts of our teaching staff here in Orkney in making these dficult decisions — it is not easy when you know you are playing a part in determining the onward learning journey of students.#But teachers and lecturers are best placed to have a strong understanding of how their learners have performed and, based on their experience and the evidence available, what a learner would be expected to achieve in each course. I am confident all our staff will have made their best overall judgements based on their experience, knowledge and activity throughout the school year – fairness to students was vital in these truly exceptional circumstances, but teachers had to ensure a true reflection of a candidate’s ability.“I wish to offer my congratulations to all those who received results today, for their commitment to their studies, and thank their families, teachers and lecturers and the wider school and college community who supported them.“Today is a day for all pupils and adult learners across Orkney to celebrate their many achievements and successes, after many months and years of study. We are pleased that the overall pass rate across Orkney’s schools remains strong at  per cent – the same as last year’s pass rate.“When schools and college stafffrom the summer holiday detailed analysis of the results will take place, subject by subject, enabling the Council to evaluate trends, build on success and establish where any improvements may be needed.#We remain committed to assist in whatever way we can in helping all students move forward into positive destinations.”Kirkwall Grammar School head teacher, Don Hawkins, expressed his pride a the quality and amount of work carried out by staff to ensure the best possible outcomes for the young people of KGS.He said: “This can also be a time of incredible pressure for our young people and for some this will be a period of extreme anxiety, especiallytheir grades don#t match up to their expectations or hopes.“My message to all young people is that there is no one pathway.  No one’s journey will be exactly what they hoped for.  Congratulations on your success andthe results are not what you had wished, pick yourself up and try again.  As someone once said ‘there is no disgrace in being knocked down, there is only shame in not getting back up never quit!’.#Your parents and teachers will be there to provide you with the support and guidance you need to adapt the plan your pathway going forward.#Orkney schools and other local organisations are on hand to help pupils who are concerned about their exam results, or who just want some advice on what to do next.

We urgently need support from the government for a service that is literally a leline for our most vulnerable and remote communities.“The need for social distancing — while essential — has massively reduced the number of passengers we can carry — and this has had a major impact on the company’s income over the last four months.“This income is a vital part of Orkney Ferries’ funding. But despite this, we have continued to operate fully-manned vessels carrying food, medicine, fuel and many other vital supplies our isles communities depend upon.#Councillor Dawson said an appeal for support has already been made and initially turned down by the government.But he says the board are #shocked# and #appalled# that in addition to supporting other Scottish ferry companies, £ million in emergency Scottish Government funding has been handed out to Glasgow Subway and Edinburgh Trams.Orkney Islands Council has long argued that the service should be fully funded by the Scottish Government, in line with similar leline ferry operations where in Scotland.Councillor Dawson added: “That sends a message that the Government considers the wellbeing of people in the Central Belt to be more important than that of folk in Orkney’s North and South Isles.“We are simply asking for parity in the way the company is treated — and that emergency funding is provided, enabling us to continue our support for the many communities that depend on our inter-island ferry service.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars. I think my mum must have started a trend.“I do like my name. I am proud of it. I’m so proud of it I called my son Tyrone also. I wouldn’t change my name to anything less unusual. It’s given me a unique take on le. My we, when we met, didn’t even know who Tyrone Power was, so she was unfazed.”  Belfast   Most ReadFormer UTV presenter Brian Black dies after car plunges into water at Strangford#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike NesbittBar closed for deep clean after outbreak of Covid- in Co DownGeorge Best cafe opens in Co Down village that football hero called home Coronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths and eight new cases of Covid- as face masks debate continues ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is no exaggeration to say that each and every one of us now lives in the Ireland Hume imagined - an island at peace and free to decide its own destiny.This is an historic moment on this island but most of all it is a moment of deep, deep sadness. In the days ahead, Ireland will be united in mourning his loss. However amidst that national mourning, it is equally true that the marking of John#s death also opens up a space to reflect on, and celebrate, the magnitude of his le. As part of that reflection of John#s work, never has the beatitude rung truer - blessed be the peacemakers. The le of John Hume will forever be a blessing upon this island since Ireland is now blessed by the peace he gted to us all. It is the greatest legacy a political leader can bestow upon his country.Hume will always find a home amongst the pantheon of great Irish leaders and it is only right and natural that he will now be spoken of in the very same breath as O#Connell and Parnell. It is important that John#s endeavours are fully appreciated in terms of their sheer scale - his impact and legacy extends well beyond one letime and well beyond the confines of Northern Ireland. His le#s work brought to an end the seemingly intractable historical arc of bitter conflict between the neighbouring islands of Britain and Ireland. After some  years which inflicted so much hurt and harm on all our peoples, it is John Hume who must now be remembered as the great healer of that history. For all of these reasons and more, John Hume truly was Ireland#s greatest. Whilst John Hume lived most of his adult le at the centre of modern Irish history and its politics, it is important that we remember that for John#s family, he was the very centre of their lives and of their love. The Irish nation has lost a giant of its history but his family have lost a husband, a father and a grandfather. The thoughts, prayers and love of all the SDLP family are today with the entire Hume family - with his children Terese, Aine, Aidan, John and Mo, his brothers and sisters and all his grandchildren. Most especially our thoughts are with his loving we Pat who cared for and carried alongside John the very same burdens over many dark and dficult years. It is especially poignant that John#s death has occurred as we concluded celebrations of the th anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement, a time which first awakened his political journey. Witnessing the enflamed streets of the s and a community determined to rise up and put an end to the systematic discrimination of the state, John chose to build a politics and a political party which was true to its time and true to the aspirations and the needs of our people. The Good Friday Agreement, embraced and endorsed by the Irish people in , is the institutional embodiment of that creed and its vision. John was not simply the Agreement#s architect or its builder, he was very much both. He will forever remain its enduring inspiration. As part of our reflection, a special mention is appropriate for the city that was always so special to John Hume. Today, Derry is a city shrouded in grief. John Hume once summed up his political philosophy in saying, #I never thought in terms of being a leader. I thought very simply in terms of helping people.# The simplicity of that statement remains a powerful insight into the patriotic devotion that came to define the man. Having spent his le in the service of others, no-one is more deserving of the eternal rest which now awaits him.

He and his we Millie came to Ireland in , and John and Pat Hume brought them to the site of O#Neill#s ancestral home at Buncrana in Donegal.During his visit O#Neill was given a tour of Derry and he asked John Hume: Why are all these men standing around street corners Hume told him it was because they had no work. This helped galvanise O#Neill to lend his considerable political weight to finding money to help set up the IFI.His daughter Rosemary confirmed to me in an interview in Washington: My father was thrilled by his visit to Donegal. Ireland was such an integral part of him, and loved just being able to do something to help.Meanwhile, Hume worked hard with his many sympathetic contacts in Washington, including Senator Ted Kennedy, and he also had contacts with President Jimmy Carter, who had been persuaded by O#Neill, Kennedy and others to take an interest in Ireland.O#Neill was also instrumental in bending the ear of President Ronald Reagan, who was helped by the Irish Embassy in Washington to discover his Irish roots. He accepted an invitation to a St Patrick#s Day lunch at the Embassy and he noted the Irish flag on display.He told the then Ambassador Sean Donlon: My great, great grandfather would be very proud of this.It was no coincidence that Reagan went to Ballyporeen during his visit to Ireland in June .Reagan had an excellent personal relationship with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and no doubt helped to allay her fears about help for the IFI from purely US sources. The remit was therefore widened to include Commonwealth countries, and later the European Union.All the pieces of the complex political jigsaw eventually fell into place and on September ,  the IFI was established. It was a considerable achievement in less than a year after the bitterly isive Anglo-Irish Agreement of November  which had driven such a wedge, between unionists and Thatcher.The IFI has been a great success.Former chairman Willie McCarter said: Its work can be seen in almost every city, town and village of the border counties.More than two decades later John Hume revealed to me some of the details of his role in this remarkable achievement. As he sat in his home in Derry with his beloved we Pat by his side, I marvelled that John so matter-of-factly told his story of dealing with some of the world#s most powerful politicians.John Hume was indeed a political titan, as Tony Blair has rightly recalled.But he was also a man of immense charm who carried his considerable achievements with great modesty and grace.That is what I gratefully remember about him most.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The former Chester and Maidenhead forward, who missed the defeat to Sligo Rovers at the weekend, opened the scoring at the start of the second half, after which captain Conor McCormack sealed the points with his first goal for the club in over four years. This was a much-improved Derry City display as they showed more hunger and desire and ultimately more threat against a St. Pat’s team who thoroughly disappointed. googletag.cmd.push Declan Devine made three changes to the team which wilted against Sligo Rovers, Colm Horgan and Jack Malone starting, whilst James Akintunde made his Candystripes debut. For St. Pat’s, there was a debut for former City player and recent target Georgie Kelly, with the hosts looking to build on their impressive performance and result against Dundalk. There was a lively start from both teams with Robbie Benson bringing a good save from Pater Cherrie with an effort from  yards, before Gerardo Bruna tested Brendan Clarke from a similar distance. At the other end, all eyes were on Akintunde on his debut and whilst the first  minutes passed him by, he was heavily involved in creating a chance for his team when he worked his way in from the right before finding Conor McCormack, who set up Joe Thomson for a curling -yard shot which just ailed wide of Brendan Clarke’s upright. googletag.cmd.push Walter Figueira came even closer just minutes later, collecting the ball  yards from goal before trying an ambitious effort which had Clarke scrambling across his goal before it flashed just wide of the post. The second half began perfectly for Derry City who took the lead with their first serious attack. Colm Horgan did well to bring the ball down the right and he fed the supporting Jack Malone, who placed a low cross into the heart of the penalty area where James Akintunde was on hand to direct the ball past Clarke and into the net for a debut goal. The next goal in this one was so important and it went the way of the visitors who punished a St. Pat’s mistake ruthlessly. Luke McNally gave the ball away deep in his own half and Figueira latched onto it before driving towards goal. The City playmaker got in the vicinity of the Pat’s area before leaving it for Conor McCormack, the midfielder skilfully curling the ball around Brendan Clarke and into the corner from  yards to double his team’s lead with just over  minutes remaining. City held firm in the closing stages to give them three very valuable points ahead of the weekend game against league leaders Shamrock Rovers. Teams ST. PATRICK’S ATHLETIC: Clarke, Titov , Desmond, McNally, Feely, Grfin, Benson, Gibson , Lennon , Ward , Kelly .  DERRY CITY: Cherrie, Horgan, Toal, Gilchrist, Coll, Malone , Thomson, McCormack, Bruna , Figueira, Akintunde .

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

But there was concern locally that the South Eastern Trust had been unable to provide a definitive date when this would happen.Trust officials mdash who gave a commitment to outline the date at the end of this month mdash have confirmed that emergency services will recommence on October  and operate between am and pm from Monday to Friday.In addition, a new daily minor injuries unit opens for business on August  at the Downpatrick hospital, operating on an appointment only basis with patients required to ring ahead for an appointment. The Downersquos GP out-of-hours service is also continuing as normal.While the planned reopening of the emergency department has been warmly welcomed, health officials say they are continuing to manage Covid- and that all plans remain subject to a number of critical factors.These include workforce availability, adequate supplies of personal and protective equipment, the potential impact of further surges of coronavirus and managing safety and risk for patients, service users and staff.The South Eastern Trust has also referenced concern about the ldquocirculation of information which may be inaccurate and misleading to the local community and reaffirmed its commitment to the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital continues to play a vital role in responding to the Covid- pandemic and the Trust would like to thank the local community for the support and appreciation offered to our dedicated staff, who continue to work tirelessly to protect and care for the health and wellbeing of our population, a spokeswoman added.Health officials say they are working to rebuild health and social care services in accordance with the Department of Healthrsquos lsquostrategic framework for rebuilding health and social care services,rsquo explaining that as they do this, their absolute priority remains keeping patients, service users and staff safe.South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who organised last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick to press for the urgentof the emergency department and other services, described confirmation of the date for the restoration of emergency care as a ldquopositive outcome to the recent community campaign to protect local services.The MP also accused the South Eastern Trust of performing a ldquoU-turn in relation to the reinstatement of emergency services.He continued: ldquoOnly a number of weeks ago the Trust insisted that it was not possible to give a date for the restoration of emergency services but, following several heated exchanges with local political representatives and a five party meeting with trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee last week, the Trust has now performed a u-turn and announced that the service will be reopen on October .ldquoThis is welcome news for our community which, for too long, has been without the necessary services in our hospital. It is also a very powerful illustration of what can be achievedour community stands together in the interests of our local hospital and the wonderful staff at the Downe.Mr Hazzard said that in the months ahead, all political parties, trade union representatives, hospital campaigners and the health trust will work together to deliver for the Downe.The MP added: ldquoI want to thank the local community for rallying to this issue in recent weeks and extend a huge message of solidarity to those members of staff at the Downe who have worked tirelessly in very dficult circumstances in recent times.The Down Community Health Committee said while the reopening date is later than it might have wished and is subject to other factors, it is to be welcomed.ldquoThe Downe is a tremendous facility for the local community and recent investments in the hospital and those that are planned in the not too distant future will enable it to deliver even more and better services for our community and, indeed, across the region, campaigners said in a statement.ldquoWe must all continue to be watchful to ensure that the Department of Health does not attempt to introduce any change to healthcare provision without full consultation with the local community and its representatives.Campaigners say they welcome the manner in which local politicians have come together and exerted their not inconsiderable influence in connection with theof emergency services.Campaigners add: ldquoThere is still a great deal to be done to further protect, enhance and develop the services currently on offer at the Downe.

Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11154415.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Instead, we would ask that people light a candle for peace at pm in their homes or at their door.President Michael D Higgins honoured that wish, as well as Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin, both tweeting pictures of lit candles in Mr Hume#s memory.Stormont Justice Minister Naomi Long and Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson also lit candles for Mr Hume.Posting an image of a candle burning in a window of Stormont House in Belfast, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis wrote on Twitter: Lighting a candle this evening at Stormont House to remember John Hume and the extraordinary legacy he leaves behind.This flame reminds us of his enduring commitment to bringing peace to everyone in Northern Ireland.Father Paul Farren, from St Eugene#s Cathedral, said: Pat and her family are very grateful for the outpouring of love and support following the death of their beloved John.The family are anxious that a public gathering for John#s funeral might inadvertently put someone#s health at risk in the context of the current Covid- pandemic, and are asking that people express their grief by staying at home and joining with the Hume family in a Celebration of Light for Peace.Instead of lining roads and streets to show respect to John, it is the wish of the Hume family that we remain at home and, at pm, light a candle and join with the family to pray the prayer for peace of Saint Francis of Assisi in the presence of John#s body in the cathedral.This Celebration of Light for Peace is a fitting tribute to a much-loved and distinguished Irishman.Mr Hume, a former MP, Stormont Assembly member and MEP, was a founding member of the party he went on to lead for  years.He was a key figure in the civil rights campaigns of the late s and also played a leading role in the formation of the credit union movement.Throughout his political career, he remained steadfast in his commitment to non-violence.His participation in secret talks with then Sinn Feacutein president Gerry Adams in the late s and early s was a key catalyst for the nascent peace process.The SDLP leader faced intense criticism, including some from within his own party, when his dialogue with Mr Adams became public in .Despite threats to his le, he persisted with his efforts to engage with the republican movement and to convince the IRA to end its campaign of violence.The highlight of Mr Hume#s career came in  with the signing of the historic Good Friday accord which largely ended the -year sectarian conflict.Along with Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, now Lord Trimble, Mr Hume was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to stopping the bloodshed.In , Mr Hume was named Ireland#s Greatest in a poll by Ireland#s national broadcaster RTEacute.His death came just six months after that of fellow Good Friday architect and long-time SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon.John Humes remains are carried into St Eugenes Cathedral in Derry.

Robert Rennie whose address was given as Malmesbury, Wiltshire, had registered himself as the owner of the Common and Crosscommon with Glamorgan County Council.It is believed in some quarters that the claim may be a hoax.But the Parish Council is treating it seriously and has asked the Association of Parish Councilsrsquo solicitors to take up the matter on their behalf.The Parish Council will certainly have unprecedented support from the villagers and many people outside, in their fight.The Common is the home of organised sport in the shape of local rugby and cricket clubs and widely used by local residents and visitors as a popular recreation area.It was at one time owned by the Lord of the Manor, General H. H. Lee.But it has been maintained by the Parish Council out of the local rate fund, ever since they took it over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
