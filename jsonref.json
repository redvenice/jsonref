Good bloke. I like him. Bit pale, though. This one\u0027s got a better tan\u0027.\u0027But it is his unwavering support for Brexit during the EU referendum that will have endeared him to Boris Johnson.         He became a household name after he married Akshata Murthy, the daughter of the billionaire founder of a staggeringly successful IT company         Before entering politics, Mr Sunak, who is now a multi-millionaire in his own right, worked in California, India and Britain for various investment firms including Goldman Sachs            With their combined wealth, it comes as little surprise that, taking on the roles of Lord and Lady of the manor – locally he is dubbed the \u0027Maharaja of the Dales\u0027 (pictured, their magnificent Georgian manor in North Yorkshire)After analytically assessing both Remain and Leave, he deduced that \u0027having the flexibility and the nimbleness to adapt\u0027 outside of the bloc \u0027would be of enormous value to us\u0027.In yesterday\u0027s reshuffle, which was characterised by Boris\u0027s promotion of loyalists, Mr Sunak was always going to prosper.After all, it was Mr Sunak, then a junior minister in the Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government – along with Robert Jenrick, 38, the current Housing Secretary and Oliver Dowden, 41, the new Culture Secretary – who ignited Boris Johnson\u0027s leadership prospects before the start of last year\u0027s contest with an article in The Times under the headline: \u0027The Tories are in deep peril. Only Boris Johnson can save us.\u0027       Born in Southampton to second-generation Indian Punjabi parents, Mr Sunak has spoken publicly about how his father, a GP, and his mother, who is a pharmacist, had to make sacrifices to send him to Winchester College. He is pictured with his wife, Akshata, and their children The timing was crucial. It came as many Tory MPs were muttering behind closed doors that they did not feel Boris was a winner.But Mr Sunak\u0027s intervention showed that Boris had won over some of the brightest of the young generation of Tory MPs.And so, when Boris proved victorious, Mr Sunak was rewarded by being dramatically promoted to Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\u0027Rishi\u0027s job was to make sure northern voters aren\u0027t just on loan to us, but that they stay permanently with us,\u0027 said one source last night. \u0027He\u0027s now in the right job to carry on that work.\u0027Born in Southampton to second-generation Indian Punjabi parents, Mr Sunak has spoken publicly about how his father, a GP, and his mother, who is a pharmacist, had to make sacrifices to send him to Winchester College, where fees are currently £41,000 a year.While he is fiercely proud of his Indian and Hindu heritage, he regards Britain as his home.                      Rishi Sunak (right) was promoted from Chief Secretary to the Treasury to Chancellor after Mr Javid (left) resigned today       \u0027British Indian\u0027 is what I tick on the census,\u0027 he has said.\u0027I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian. My wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu.\u0027After taking a first in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford, he travelled on a Fulbright scholarship to Stanford University in California where met his future wife Akshata, whose father N R Narayana Murthy – worth around £2billion – co-founded Infosys, an IT company today valued at around £33.3billion.The couple, who now have two daughters, married in 2009 in her home city of Bangalore in a two-day ceremony attended by 1,000 guests.Before entering politics, Mr Sunak, who is now a multi-millionaire in his own right, worked in California, India and Britain for various investment firms including Goldman Sachs. He later set up his own business, Theleme Partners, in 2010 with an initial fund of £536million.         The couple, who now have two daughters, married in 2009 in her home city of Bangalore in a two-day ceremony attended by 1,000 guests While building the hedge fund he spent a couple of days doing voluntary work for the Conservatives – which was when he decided he would like to go into politics full-time. He walked the selection race in Richmond, one of the safest Tory seats in the country. His majority last time was 27,000.         Mr Sunak\u0027s father-in-law N.R. Narayana Murthy with David Cameron in 2010 Meanwhile his wife, whose shareholding in the family firm is estimated at £185million, runs her own fashion label Akshata Designs and is also a director of a venture capital firm founded by her father in 2010.With their combined wealth, it comes as little surprise that, taking on the roles of Lord and Lady of the manor – locally he is dubbed the \u0027Maharaja of the Dales\u0027 – the summer garden party they throw for local villagers at their magnificent Georgian £1.5million manor house in Northallerton is by far the most glamorous invitation in the Yorkshire social calendar.Uniformed staff serve champagne and canapes as guests mingle alongside the ornamental lake with its boathouse, private wooded island and paddocks set in 12 acres. But whether Mr Sunak will have had time to revel in his palatial home in recent months is unlikely, as Mr Johnson has grown increasingly dependent on him.An assured media performer, Mr Sunak was one of only a handful of ministers who were trusted by 10 Downing Street to take to the airwaves during the recent election. He also stood in for Boris during some of the campaign\u0027s seven-way TV debates.But while he rarely slips up on policy, in truth Mr Sunak is not a brilliant orator, with one critic in the Labour-supporting Guardian branding him \u0027cheesy and wooden\u0027.         When grilled in a recent podcast by BBC presenter Nick Robinson about his professed love for Star Wars, Mr Sunak – who is also a devoted supporter of Southampton football club – batted off every question with ease But he radiates self-confidence and is never caught short when interviewers ask him about a hinterland beyond politics. When grilled in a recent podcast by BBC presenter Nick Robinson about his professed love for Star Wars, Mr Sunak – who is also a devoted supporter of Southampton football club – batted off every question with ease.He also admitted that he\u0027s a Coca-Cola addict and has \u0027seven fillings to show for it\u0027.Whether his amicable demeanour will be enough for him to thrive in one of Britain\u0027s Great Offices of State is yet to be seen.Indeed, his first big test will be next month\u0027s Budget. I suspect, however, that he will be more than a match for the Labour barbs.Being labelled a \u0027prime minister-in-waiting\u0027 is often an unwelcome attribute for those who know that the heir apparent often does not get to wear the crown.But in Mr Sunak\u0027s case, his surprising rise through the ranks doesn\u0027t look like it\u0027s stopping.

The counter-extremism expert discusses fear, loathing and democracy in an age of disinformationOne October evening in 2017, the counter-extremism expert Julia Ebner put on a wig and a pair of glasses, walked into a pub in Mayfair, London, and sat down with 20 strangers. She was attending the inaugural strategy meeting for the UK members of Generation Identity, a pan-European far-right network known for spreading anti-immigration ideas and stoking fears about a “great replacement” in which white populations become minorities. Ebner had spent months infiltrating the group’s encrypted, invite-only messaging channels under an alias and striking up a rapport with members now she was meeting them in person.I meet Ebner at the same pub, only this time it is mid-morning and, save for the barman polishing furniture, there is no one else here. “This feels weird,” she says. “I was really scared walking in that night so I remember it as having a dark and oppressive atmosphere. I’m surprised at how unremarkable it feels today.”Her first meeting with Generation Identity was brief: they talked disparagingly about the anti-racism organisation Hope Not Hate the best way of vetting new recruits white supremacist literature and where they were going on their holidays (Hungary was a popular choice). More nerve-racking, says the 28-year-old, was the second meeting the next day in a flat in Brixton, south London, which was led by Martin Sellner, the head of Identitäre Bewegung Österreich, Austria’s Identitarian Movement. Ebner feared her cover would be blown as she and Sellner had both featured in a report on extremism on Newsnight the previous year, but, as they shook hands, he didn’t appear to recognise her. Attendees were asked to fill in a questionnaire about their background and ideology, after which talks were given by Sellner and Brittany Pettibone, Sellner’s girlfriend (and now wife). Among the topics was the danger posed by infiltrators from anti-racist organisations, security services and the media. “I thought: ‘Oh God. Are they going to pull everyone’s hair to see who’s wearing a wig?’” Ebner recalls.Her experiences are detailed in her new book, Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists. Along with recording her meetings with Generation Identity, it tells how, over the course of two years, she inveigled her way into the chatrooms of the Trad Wives movement, including the anti-feminist Red Pill Women, and the Terror Agency Sister group, a women-only group for supporters of Islamic State. In US “alt-right” channels, she eavesdropped on arrangements for the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. Ebner had planned to attend but changed her mind after people began posting pictures of firearms. (The event ended in tragedy after a man deliberately drove a car into a group of protesters, killing a young woman and injuring scores more.)Ebner, who speaks five languages, is a research fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue in London, a counter-extremism organisation founded in 2006 with a focus on combating the spread of propaganda, hate speech and disinformation online. Her first book, The Rage (2018), was about the reciprocal relationship between far-right and Muslim extremists and how, she says, “each exploits the fears that the other side provokes”. She was inspired to write it after the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016 by a rightwing extremist. Before Cox’s death, her research was broadly centred on jihadism. “But then I shifted focus. I couldn’t stop thinking about what had happened to her, and I realised how little attention was being paid to the threat from the far right.”Going Dark builds on that research by revealing how extremist groups from across the ideological spectrum harness technology to spread the word, and exposes their methods of radicalisation, from online recruitment and networking to mobilisation and intimidation tactics. “The radicalisation engines that today’s extremists are building are cutting edge: artificially intelligent, emotionally manipulative and socially powerful,” Ebner writes in the introduction.In the course of her research, Ebner has been known to juggle five online identities simultaneously. To do this successfully, she says, “you have to create a story for your character. It’s a bit like inventing a character for a book. You have to know the person’s background but also her desires. What does she want? What makes her angry? And then it’s about maintaining that presence online for a period of time so people get to know you.”Newcomers to far-right extremist networks can initially be asked to prove their whiteness by taking a photo of their wrist along with a timestamp and the group logo. Ebner was once asked to submit a genetic test to prove her white ancestry (she used a fake one). Some networks even instruct new recruits to launch an online hate or disinformation campaign against, say, a political campaigner – “just to show that they are willing to go there”, Ebner says.Is there a thrill in pulling the wool over people’s eyes and potentially putting herself in danger? “I would be lying if I said there wasn’t an element of that there is an adrenaline rush in doing any kind of undercover work,” Ebner says. “To be able to get inside a movement while being completely opposed to the ideologies, that can feel good. Though there may be better ways to get that kind of kick … such as jumping out of a plane.”Nonetheless, there have been times when fears about her personal safety have almost overwhelmed her. In 2017, she wrote a comment piece for this newspaper on the mainstreaming of far-right groups in which she observed that the English Defence League co-founder Tommy Robinson’s supporters included prominent US alt-right leaders. At the time, she was working for the counter-extremist thinktank Quilliam.The next day, Robinson and a camera crew entered her office to demand that she justify linking him to white supremacists. The incident was uploaded on to the internet as part of Robinson’s Troll Watch series. It was followed by a campaign of online harassment led by others against Ebner, which included threats of sexual violence and death. “That was quite traumatising,” she recalls. When leaving work, she would worry that she was being followed, “or that when I got home there might be someone waiting for me. But in the end I came to the conclusion that that’s exactly what they want. It is their goal in their intimidation campaigns to make people quit their jobs, to make them too afraid to criticise them or expose their manipulative tactics. What kept me going was not wanting to give in.”Going Dark doesn’t underestimate the continuing threat of jihadism – a fortnight after we meet, Sudesh Amman, who had already been convicted for terror offences, stabbed two members of the public in Streatham, south London, before being shot dead by police. Ebner’s focus, however, is on the methods used by everyone from jihadists to conspiracy theorists to white supremacists and anti-feminists to disseminate, radicalise and recruit. It explains broader concepts used by extremists, including “redpilling” which, inspired by the 1999 film The Matrix, sees recruiters persuading potential sympathisers of an alternative reality in which they are oppressed and threatened by particular groups, and the “gamification” of discourse, in which terrorists adopt or are given heroic names from computer games, or are given scores for injuring or killing. By adopting the language of gamers, the lines between fantasy and reality become dangerously blurred among perpetrators and sympathisers.Ebner anticipates a near future in which AI tools bolster online extremist campaigns with “deepfakes” – fake newspaper articles and audio and film footage that has been seamlessly doctored. Matters aren’t helped by the slowness of policymakers and tech firms to rid platforms of harmful content, or the fact that extremists manage to stay one step ahead by developing new methods to escape detection. Does Ebner’s work makes her feel bleak about the future and our ability to combat extremism? “Yes,” she replies. “There are times when I feel pessimistic about how these extremist movements have the potential, in the medium and long term, to completely destabilise our democracies, not just through intimidating opponents but manipulating normal, average users and radicalising sympathisers.” But, she adds, researching the book also made her see a human side to people with extreme viewpoints. However disgusting she found their ideologies, she says she felt “empathy, even sympathy, for people’s fears. Because in the end there was always some kind of fear, or lack of love or recognition, that was driving iniduals into those networks.”On coming across young people in neo-Nazi channels (the youngest she encountered claimed to be 14), Ebner had to resist the urge to engage with them inidually and attempt to change their minds: “I had to keep telling myself that I will have a bigger impact by gathering information.” A young person’s professional future can be wrecked by associations with extremist groups, something their leaders often count on to ensure lifelong commitment. “Isis were known for putting their newest faces on their propaganda material,” she says. “It’s very hard to reverse that.”Given the threats she has endured online, Ebner is understandably cautious about sharing details of her personal life. What she will say is that she was born and raised in Vienna – her mother is an actor turned acting coach and her father a healthcare consultant. After secondary school, she studied for a degree in international business administration and philosophy in Vienna, though, she notes, “I wasn’t really interested in the business part. I just did it as I thought I could earn money.” She subsequently got a scholarship to Peking University for an MA in international relations and history. She completed her final year at the London School of Economics, where she shifted her focus to political Islam and the history of jihadism, and got her first job at Quilliam soon afterwards.Ebner recalls that, while she was growing up, there was what she describes as a “very utopian view of the future of the internet … There was this sense that it would enable the democratisation of knowledge, make the world more tolerant and build bridges rather than build tensions and split communities.” But by the early 2010s, the shine had begun to come off. “The rate of technological change scares people,” she notes. Its effect on society “is something that’s on the mind of most people of my generation”.I ask if the months spent trawling message boards with often horrifyingly violent and racist content takes its toll. “It does,” she says, “though it’s a creeping kind of trauma. Research by psychologists suggests that it can have long-term effects that can take a while to appear. I try my best to avoid social media and have online detoxes regularly, though that can be difficult. When working undercover, you need to maintain a presence online. You can’t just disappear.”• Going Dark is published on 20 February by Bloomsbury (£16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

In the past the utility was accused of profiteering from its customers by paying out rich idends to investors and virtually no tax.“It was deemed to be in the best interests of both customers and employees to accept the final determination, to ensure certainty in the months and years ahead, and to move forward positively and constructively,” the company said.Ofwat sets the price controls every five years to decide how much money people should pay for their water and the level of service they should receive. This also determines how much profit utilities can make for their investors and shareholders.The dissenting firms claim Ofwat’s price review could damage long-term investment in the sector by forcing companies to observe tougher industry targets while cutting spending and water bills.The plans could also lead to underinvestment in the UK’s water system, which would pose a risk to customers and the environment, the companies have said.The CMA said it expects to take six months to rule on whether the price controls were fair but the inquiry could take longer.Kip Meek, the chair of the inquiry, said: “Everyone needs water, so it’s really important that customers’ bills are not set too high, but at the same time the water companies have enough money to deliver an efficient and high-quality service. The CMA will look closely at whether Ofwat’s decision strikes the right balance in this and other areas and will make changes if not.”Last year Ofwat called for all water companies in England and Wales to cut bills for customers by £50 over the next five years, while spending £51bn on improving services and infrastructure. The industry had hoped to spend £56bn to meet the new performance targets, which include plugging leaks and guarding against pollution, but this could risk higher bills for households.All other water companies have accepted the tough new Ofwat standards, including the listed water giants United Utilities and Severn Trent, plus Pennon’s South West Water.Rachel Fletcher, Ofwat’s chief executive, said: “Some investors have accepted this scale of ambition and change but others need to face up to the new reality.“We are ready to fully engage with the CMA, setting out our analysis and why we are confident this is the right settlement for customers, the environment and companies.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f41bd0f5a51aff83ca83cf8f1229996197700f0/0_60_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53bd61366898181683006a98f21c3ba5","title":"school strikes hope friends of the earth craig bennett","story":"Outgoing charity chief Craig Bennett says next generation ‘could not be more exciting’The school strikes movement will ensure an exciting and dynamic future for environmental activism for decades to come, the outgoing head of Friends of the Earth has said, as students across the globe leave classrooms on Friday to demand political action on the climate crisis.Speaking on the first anniversary of the movement in the UK, Craig Bennett said it was grassroots activism, not centralised politics, that was leading to change.“What we are seeing is a new kind of informed and exciting activism,” said Bennett. “What excites me most is seeing the awakening of communities. To see the school strikes – to see the next generation of activists coming through – could not be more exciting for the movement long term.“To have a whole generation coming through going on these demonstrations, where is that going to take us? What is going to happen in 10 years’ time when they start being in employment? Are they suddenly going to turn off the activism? I don’t think so, and that is what is really hopeful for the environmental movement.”Bennett is leaving the environmental charity after 18 years, the last five as head of the organisation. In that time, the group has shifted its focus from the past tactics of lobbying Westminster politicians to the creation and development of a grassroots base of activists.In the last 18 months 150 new community action groups have been created by the movement, while supporters of the environmental charity have more than doubled from about 160,000 to more than 400,000.The move to tap into and amplify community frustrations at the failure to do enough to tackle climate breakdown has coincided with the growth of the school strikes movement and the appearance of Extinction Rebellion.“We have got to use the politics on the ground rather than rely on centralised institutions and politicians to do it for us,” he said.Bennett – who will take over as head of the Wildlife Trust in April – believes the explosion of activism has been caused partly by the deep frustration of ordinary people that we are not making fast enough progress to tackle climate change, combined with growing evidence from scientists that the world has an ever decreasing amount of time to make change.“There is something that is unique about these issues,” said Bennett. “The longer we take to achieve the change, the worse the prize of the outcome. It is quite different to, say, campaigning for the abolition of slavery … the prize you get is still the same, even if it takes 100 years to get there.“But campaigning for eight or nine billion people to live fairly within environmental limits, the longer you take to do it, the lower the quality of the prize you get.”In his tenure at Friends of the Earth, Bennett has focused on community-based action against fracking in the UK, activism that was rewarded last year when the government announced a moratorium on fracking.He believes it is community activism that has pushed the government to act against fracking, and prompted the attention Boris Johnson’s government is giving to environmental concerns. Last week Johnson brought forward the deadline for ending the sale of diesel, petrol and hybrid vehicles from 2040 to 2035.“It is primarily because of people on the streets that this is happening,” said Bennett. He pointed to polling by the thinktank Bright Blue showing that climate change and the environment were crucial to gain the support of the centre ground in British politics. “People care about the environment more than ever before,” said Bennett.Faced with what he believes are small moves by the government, Bennett says the environmental movement, including the school strikers, must continue to demonstrate and push for more rapid change. The government’s target of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 was important, but lacked any detail, he said. The prospect of the UK hosting the UN climate summit in September without “the first clue” of how to reach net zero as a nation was “unbelievably embarrassing”, said Bennett.“There is no plan to get to there,” he said. “The committee on climate change has produced a report on how to get there, but that is not government policy.“Given Boris Johnson has a stonking majority, he has no excuse and this government should do exactly what is required.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0191ac39cf033a90767291a9d66eef4b066484fa/951_991_2984_1790/master/2984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4bba32a77cbb8cbb6fca86723a9c12d","title":"how to wear big sleeves","story":"This year, the volume has moved up the arm – it’s less floaty and romantic, more muscularThe most fashionable emoji right now isn’t the dancing lady, or the face with the hearts for eyes. And it’s not the red balloon or the all-white heart (although fashion people do love the red balloon and the white heart). No, the most chic symbol on the keyboard is the muscly arm emoji with the mega-biceps that suggests itself when you type the word “strong”.That emoji is the most on-trend silhouette of the season, a cut-out-and-keep template for your 2020 wardrobe. But don’t panic, because you will not be required to weightlift, nor exist on protein milkshakes. We’re talking Popeye sleeves, not Popeye arms. That’s the whole point of fashion, surely: you get your clothes to do the aesthetic heavy lifting for you.The statement sleeve is turning out to be an unlikely long-running fashion hit. It first swept the catwalks back in 2016, mostly in the form of sleeves that were slender at the shoulder, but got bigger and more dramatic from below the elbow. Roksanda, in particular, nailed the way a bell- or tulip-shaped sleeve could transform a simple dress into something much more interesting. Catwalk names from Vetements to Jacquemus championed the ultra-long sleeve, and overnight the fashion week habit of grabbing a coffee between shows got a whole lot more challenging.Big sleeve energy is different this year. The volume has moved up the sleeve the effect is less floaty and romantic and more muscular. As I’m both practical and clumsy, this appeals to me because of the aforementioned coffee-dipping issue.With this updated leg-of-mutton sleeve you get broad, sizeable shoulders, a bit like the look you would get from a shoulder-padded jacket. But because the shape is soft, the mood isn’t so serious, somehow – less 1980s power dressing, more of a modern, Batsheva-esque slant on 1880s prairie chic.Big sleeve energy works for all ages and body shapes. And it is all the more cheering because it was not so long ago that fashion barely had any sleeves, let alone chic ones. In the power-shift days of early last decade, day dresses were mostly sleeveless, which meant a lot of goosebumps and cardigans on the backs of chairs. Sleeves make clothes more useful, which has to be a good thing, right? And these ones are particularly punchy.

She was then 20 it was her first leading role. “At that moment, I kind of realised that people were watching it.”To All the Boys was an instant smash. Netflix described it as one of its most-watched original films to date, with – significantly – “strong repeat viewings”. A new teen power-couple were born: Lara Jean Covey (Condor) and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), whose faux-mance starts to hint at the real thing.  Condor – who already had a handful of film credits to her name, including 2016’s X Men: Apocalypse – saw her Instagram numbers jump from around 100,000 to 5 million (they are now nearly double that). Centineo, meanwhile, became a heartthrob, spoken about in the same pant as Harry Styles and Timothée Chalamet. Last week in Manhattan, fans queued for five hours to see a screening of the sequel, which is out now. A third instalment has already been shot, with a more ambitious set-up taking in Vancouver, New York and Seoul.While race does not define the films, it might explain in part why To All the Boys and its sequel feel like more than the sum of their parts. Condor is Vietnamese-American and plays a character with Korean and American parentage. Born in Vietnam’s fourth-largest city, Cần Thơ, Condor was adopted by an American family – her father is a Pulitzer-prize nominated journalist – after five months in an orphanage. As for the sequel, ...PS: I Still Love You, Lara Jean and Peter’s romance is tested when her middle-school flame arrives in town. Did Condor ever worry that their unrelentingly gentle franchise could dissolve into a meninist tug of war? No, she says: rather, she was wary of her character becoming a villain.“You see in this movie that Lara Jean is flawed she’s trying to figure out how to communicate these intense feelings,” she explains. “I wanted it to be realistic that she had a hard time telling Peter what was going on, but I didn’t want her to be unlikable.” She wails down the phone, imitating a screaming fit: “I didn’t want her to be like that, but also I knew Jenny Han wasn’t going to write characters that were toxic.”In fact, the franchise continues the story in a lovely, ambling fashion – with crucial scenes set in the glam retirement complex that is home to Stormy (Holland Taylor), Lara Jean’s eccentric older confidante. Stormy gives Lara Jean an eveningwear makeover and tells her: “The way you look should be against the law.” She also tells her: “Almost every one” of her own love affairs overlapped. Any overlap in PS is a lot less torrid than one suspects Stormy’s were. The films’ careful chasteness and consent-awareness is key to their success, and Condor is an exemplary spokesperson. “Whatever you choose to do with your body and with your heart with your mind should be your choice and your choice only,” she tells her army of young fans. “You shouldn’t let anyone, or pop culture, influence you or make you do something that you don’t want to do.”To All the Boys: PS I Still Love You is on Netflix now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cd2fc321d2ce11915c58eccee274d64dd24fa7e/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09b89c328e5ccc904db97361859a5efb","title":"leadership of french oscars resigns amid polanski controversy","story":"The French film academy says unanimous resignation was to honour the film-makers and ‘regain calm’ of the festivalThe entire board of the César awards, France’s equivalent of the Oscars, has resigned two weeks before its gala ceremony amid growing controversy over the director Roman Polanski, whose film An Officer and a Spy leads the 2020 nominations.More than 400 actors, producers, directors and film personalities had earlier demanded the “profound reform” of the César academy, denouncing its dysfunction and the opaqueness of its processes, in an open letter published on Wednesday.On Thursday evening the academy said: “To honour those men and women who made cinema happen in 2019, to find calm and ensure that the festival of film remains just that, a festival, the board ... has unanimously decided to resign. This collective decision will allow complete renewal of the board.”The academy has come under intense criticism after Polanski’s film about Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish French army officer accused of spying for Germany and unjustly convicted of treason in the 1890s, garnered 12 nominations for the awards, due to be presented on 28 February.The Polish-born director fled from the US to France in 1978 after admitting the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl and has been a fugitive from the US justice system ever since, despite repeated attempts to have him extradited.The inclusion of his film – titled J’accuse in France – on the Césars’ shortlist was condemned by France’s equality minister, women’s groups and film critics alike.The head of the academy, Alain Terzian, accused of autocratic behaviour by his many critics, brushed aside the criticism, saying the academy “should not take moral positions” about giving awards, but French feminist groups have urged César voters to boycott Polanski’s film and called for a protest outside the award ceremony, to be held in Paris’s Salle Pleyel auditorium.“When we mobilise, things happen!”, the feminist collective Nous Toutes (All Of Us) tweeted. Another group, Osez le féminisme! (Dare Feminism), said: “Imagine what’s next. A new voting panel without male self-confidence, opacity and sexism. Will we finally stop applauding rapists and paedophiles on the run?”The signatories of the open letter, who include the X-Men actor Omar Sy and Bérénice Béjo from the 2011 film The Artist, also complained that the founding statutes of the Césars had not changed in decades and that the academy’s members did not have any real say in its decisions or the running of the ceremony.The academy’s board said in response that it would ask the national cinema centre, part of the culture ministry, to appoint a mediator to oversee a “root and branch reform” of its statutes and governance.The accusations against Polanski long pre-date the scandal that has engulfed the Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein since 2017.But the director’s past has come under renewed scrutiny as the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment and abuse has grown in response to the allegations against Weinstein, who is on trial for rape and sexual assault in New York.Polanski has blamed Weinstein for his woes, claiming that the disgraced Hollywood mogul tried to brand him a “child rapist” to stop him winning an Oscar in 2003 for The Pianist. He also sparked uproar at the Venice film festival last summer by comparing his “hounding” to the antisemitic persecution of Dreyfus.Polanski, who was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2018, launched his new film in France last year days after a French photographer, Valentine Monnier, accused him of raping her in a Swiss ski resort when she was a teenager.The accusation, which Polanski, now 86, denies, sparked a backlash against the film, publicity was curtailed and some screenings were cancelled after feminist protesters invaded or blockaded cinemas. Despite this, An Officer and a Spy did well at the box office in France, with more than 1.5m ticket sales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb05a773fb1a7b4e83f9620da4dfb28581efda18/0_844_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30ad2833b667e00cf4022482986545b","title":"spaghetti and ice cream anna jones meals for one","story":"There’s no need to get fancy cooking for one: bring on the spaghetti with chillies and greens, followed by a chocolate and sticky blood orange sundae My husband thinks that, rather than write more recipes, I should start documenting the things chefs cook for themselves.We are a strange bunch, programmed to feed and spoil, but once we’ve fed others, the idea of picking up another pan is a turn-off.

His debut for RB Leipzig had gone badly: they had not expected to lose 2-0 to the struggling local side Erzgebirge and they had certainly not banked on being pelted with snowballs by home supporters at full time, forcing them to run for the tunnel. In the stands two banners had compared his new club to “Nazis” and it was some way for a new arrival from Sweden to receive his first taste of life in Germany’s second tier.“That’s maybe when I became a bit more aware that this club was hated here in Germany,” Forsberg says, specifically referencing those icy missiles. There are many who will never accept RB Leipzig’s existence and it stings all the more given that, in the five years since then, their momentum has been virtually unchecked. Forsberg is sitting in a classroom at the club’s training centre and hopes this will be the biggest half-season of his career. Julian Nagelsmann’s side sit second in the Bundesliga, a point behind Bayern Munich and a valid bet to win the title, and on Wednesday will face Tottenham in their first-ever Champions League round of 16 tie. Anyone who hoped they would be short-lived arrivistes is not going to get their way.“Some people like it, some people don’t, but what can we do?” he asks. “We’re here, we enjoy it, we don’t try and step on anyone’s feet.” When Forsberg came from Malmö in January 2015, at that point a 23-year-old winger who could have joined clubs with far headier reputations, eyebrows were raised back home and opinions followed accordingly. Forsberg admits he “had to Google it up” when he heard RB Leipzig, who had begun life as a fifth-ision club only in 2009, were interested but he was quickly seduced by the persuasive power of Ralf Rangnick, who these days heads up Red Bull’s entire football department but back then was the sporting director of its Leipzig and Salzburg isions.“You just have to bow down,” Forsberg says of Rangnick, whose global network for spotting young talent is virtually peerless. “He’s a very emotional guy and it’s so easy to join in that emotion when he talks. He knows what he wants, wants everything correct in every small detail and that’s what I love about him, because this guy is never satisfied. That’s a big reason why the club is where it is today.”Forsberg remembers training in a temporary facility when he first arrived, and being reminded to yell “achtung” upon turning on the shower because it would inflict an unpleasant temperature change upon others. It should not be taken as a sob story because little has ever been left to chance. Leipzig were promoted – with Rangnick in charge – during his first full season and only when they finished runners-up in their first Bundesliga campaign under Ralph Hasenhüttl did it ever really feel that they were ahead of schedule. Forsberg, moved centrally from out wide to unleash his creative potential, was in sensational form that year. “I was a good left winger but an even better No 10, it turned me into the right player,” he says, a statement borne out by the 22 assists that outdid anyone else in Europe’s top five leagues.“No one can say anything now,” he says of those in Sweden who chided him. “My career and the things I’ve done here speak for themselves.” Like Leipzig, he flattened out slightly after that exhilarating 2016-17 season, a series of groin problems not helping his form. It has become common practice to write off Forsberg, because he is now a 28-year-old in a club that valorise youth like few others. But he was instrumental to a first half of the present campaign that took Leipzig to the top of both the Bundesliga and their Champions League group, scoring eight times and thriving under the leadership of Nagelsmann.“I think he made me better and made the team better: the right coach for the right club at the right time,” he says of the manager, who is only four years his senior. Nagelsmann has, by common consent, added a more technical element to the pressing game developed under Rangnick and Hasenhüttl. His training drills have a reputation for being complex but Forsberg has found his eyes opened anew at a relatively late stage.Forsberg’s father Leif – himself a storied former footballer with the hometown club they both represented, GIF Sundsvall – once said his son is “without a doubt the most boring player to interview”. It turns out that is not true he converses readily and does not dodge a topic, even if a palpable guardedness tends to underpin his responses. There is only one question that prompts a pause of several seconds. The snowballs in Aue were far from the only occurrences of hostility from opposing crowds in his half-decade with Leipzig: a severed bull’s head was thrown near the pitch in a match at Dinamo Dresden in 2016 and, to give just one more recent example, Union Berlin’s fans began their meeting on this season’s opening day with a 15-minute silence.Even if attitudes have softened in some quarters, there will always be those who never accept a Red Bull-owned club in a country where the stake held by supporters remains sacrosanct. It is perfectly reasonable for Forsberg not to agree with the opprobrium his club has faced but does he, at least, understand it?“Everyone’s going to have an opinion on every little thing,” comes the reply, at length. “All we can do is go on our path and, if people want to try and stand in our way, we’re going to try and beat them – on the pitch, not off the pitch. We didn’t come up being all cocky, saying: ‘We’re going to be the best team in Germany now, now, now.’ We’ve taken it step by step we have to stay humble and keep focused.“I can feel that it’s going in the right direction now. I think more and more people feel with us, and see we do the right thing here. We’re not here to buy Neymar, Mbappé and Messi. We’re here to buy young players, develop them, play football and have fun. I think people can recognise themselves in that.”To understand Forsberg, and particularly his imperviousness to background noise, it is worth hearing how heavily his surname weighed while he was coming through at GIF Sundsvall. Leif was a club legend and his grandfather, Lennart, was also a player there. Sundsvall is a small town and people would talk. “When I came up to the first team, everyone said it was because of my dad,” he says. “That just gave me more motivation to play even better and I think I showed everyone I was there to stay. It’s like this when you have a parent who’s a bit famous, and you have to deal with it. I always had a strong will and was sure I was going to make it.”He did, even if there was a dalliance with floorball after football coaches expressed doubts about his size. Now he is supremely comfortable in his own skin. “I could see myself playing anywhere not to brag, but I feel I have the qualities,” he says. Liverpool were previously linked with a move and perhaps they, or other Premier League clubs, might be tempted this summer given that Forsberg has found it hard to get back into Nagelsmann’s starting XI since a cold laid him low during the winter break.There is every chance he will be trusted at White Hart Lane though: Forsberg scored Leipzig’s first-ever Champions League goal and has been on target three times in this season’s edition, including two against Benfica in an injury-time comeback. Perhaps, particularly given Spurs’ mediocre form, he and his gang of upstarts should be favourites to reach the last eight.The concern for Spurs, and for whose who would wish RB Leipzig away, is that they tend to do exactly that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed74b4317bcabb511608ee0cc6f3c18d731dc353/0_102_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2af8c6c82b12f684dcec84881761ef8","title":"paul pogba hopes for summer exit but manchester united want 100m","story":"Paul Pogba wants to leave Manchester United in the summer but his chances of securing a swift exit are likely to be hampered by the club setting an asking price of around €100m (£83m).Juventus remain interested in re-signing the midfielder and Real Madrid have him on their radar but both clubs consider such a fee too high for a player who has been largely underwhelming at United since he rejoined in 2016.Pogba is convinced a move would be in everyone’s best interests and his agent, Mino Raiola, said on Thursday night the player would like to return to Juventus.

Samba tried to get out, his arms and legs scrambling frantically in search of something to grip on to as muddy water choked him.His father, Sah, still carries a photo of his son’s lifeless body after it was recovered from the mining pit in September 2017.Between 2017 and 2019, at least 115 children and adults drowned or were buried alive by landfalls in the mostly abandoned pits in the East and Adamawa regions of Cameroon, according to Forests and Rural Development (Foder), a local watchdog that is alone in tracking the accidents and deaths. “The whole area was not at all secure,” says Sah, whose fury is clear as he describes how gold mining pits in the region – which locals call “tombs” – have been left open and abandoned by Chinese companies, among others.Samba’s tragic death was not exceptional. The recorded body count, say campaigners, is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of forgotten victims of the ruthless modern-day hunt for one of the world’s most sought-after metals – gold.Cameroon has one of the richest subsoils in Africa.Since 2008, gold prices have risen and informal mining has spread widely across the continent. In recent years, more than 400 mining sites have been dug open by dozens of mining companies in Cameroon, predominantly from China, but also from South Korea, Greece, South Africa and elsewhere, according to Foder. Some British companies advertise online that they conduct gold exploration programmes in the country.Cameroonian law obliges anyone exploiting a mining site to close and restore it before departing. In practice, however, once miners finish digging up gold from pits of up to 100 metres deep, they simply move on to the next project. Few – if any – mining holes are properly restored.The scale of this is vast, says Eric Etoga, a Cameroonian activist who has been researching the extractive industries for years for Global Youth Dynamic, a local NGO. According to a study he produced in June 2019 for the Publish What You Pay campaign group, mining companies had left 248 open mining holes in in one area of east Cameroon alone. “We need sanctions – without them, people continue to do whatever they want,” said Etoga.Cameroon’s ministry of mines did not reply to repeated requests for comment.The Cameroonian branch of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a global body that promotes itself as setting the “global standard to promote the open and accountable management of oil, gas and mineral resources”, also failed to address the deaths in the mines, simply forwarding government reassurances that the numbers of mortalities in abandoned pits have significantly decreased over the past two years.The ministry of mines added that there are fewer deaths following its implementation of information campaigns. “The risky zones have been marked and picture-diagrams have been erected to inform locals of the dangers,” wrote Aristide Mimbang of Cameroon’s mining ministry, in an email forwarded by EITI Cameroon.Walking among abandoned mining holes in parts of eastern Cameroon, nothing appears further from the truth. Not a single signpost or diagram was seen in the seven sites visited by the , as unaccompanied young children walked barefoot or wearing flip-flops in the dangerous areas. Women with babies tied on their backs were seen descending into the mines with no protection or safety precautions.On paper, some British companies extracting gold in Cameroon praise the benefits of the business for local populations, claiming that it helps villagers to survive financially. On the ground, some of the youths working in gold mines confirm that the industry enables them to earn money, which they would otherwise have been unable to do in an underdeveloped region that lacks basic services, including a steady electricity supply.Yet, when it comes to the open mining pits, corporate reassurances that the holes will be filled up and restored ring hollow. The landscape of eastern Cameroon, which in the past used to provide fertile farming ground for the local population, nowadays resembles the surface of the moon, with giant holes puncturing the once green landscape. As the midday sun heated the pits, the brown, polluted waters inside reek of chemical waste, attracting clouds of buzzing mosquitoes that spread malaria, dengue fever and other killer diseases.China is Cameroon’s biggest foreign investor and trading partner, operating a wide range of infrastructure projects, from constructing roads to building football stadiums. In January 2019, one of China’s top diplomats, Yang Jiechi, visited the Central African nation.Yet, in eastern Cameroon, the visit prompted protests, as miners picketed outside a Chinese-run gold mining project in the village of Ngoura, blocking access.In December 2017, in the nearby village of Ngoe Ngoe, nine people were killed during a land fall in a deep mine left open by the Chinese company Lu and Lang. The pit had been abandoned by workers less than a month earlier. Chinese and other foreign companies are not the only ones responsible. In 2017, Narma Ndoyama, a farmer, lost his 28-year-old son after he was buried alive in a mine landslide in the Longa Mali village, eastern Cameroon.“Now his wife is alone trying to provide for five children,” says Ndoyama, adding that the average of 1,500 west African CFA francs (£1.91) he makes each day from farming leaves him unable to help much.Ndoyama alleges that the mine in which his son died belonged to Société Camerounaise d’Exploitation Minière (SCEM), a company owned by Ali Bachir, a prominent member of Cameroon’s national assembly from the ruling party, the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement.The party is led by Cameroon’s president, Paul Biya, who, aged 87, is currently Africa’s second longest-ruling autocrat (after Equatorial Guinea’s president Teodoro Obiang).Ndoyama said that he had tried to press SCEM officials to launch an inquiry into his son’s death in the hope of getting some desperately needed compensation for the family, but received no response. “The gendarmerie came to do an investigation, but there was no follow up,” he says. “The state lets people just die in the holes.”In a telephone interview, Ali Bachir confirmed that he owns SCEM and that the company is still operating, but denied that his company is involved in digging mining pits.“There’s not even a single hole that we’ve left open,” he said.“We do research,” he added. “It’s the Chinese who left the holes open … It’s they who are exploiting gold in Betare Oya.”Yet official ministry of mines documents obtained by the  show that SCEM has conducted gold exploitation in several sites in eastern Cameroon – all without proper authorisation. According to the documents, two branches of SCEM were operating in the Betare Oya region in 2016, using five excavators, and declaring a total of 230 grams of gold a month.Mining companies also say they use pictures to illustrate the dangers of mercury use as a deterrent.“I know the dangers,” Marie Louise admitted. ”But it’s money. Without this, how will we live?,” she ssays, adding that the children also sometimes use mercury to help with gold processing.“When we see that the belly is empty, we have to do it in order to eat,” she adds, gesturing to her children.For Cameroon’s young generation, the gold mining industry is not only claiming lives in accidents in unsecured pits, but also results in many students dropping out of school. One headmaster of a school in Betare Oya told the  that each year, almost half of the students drop out to work in gold mines as soon as the dry season begins in December. The pattern is the same throughout the gold mining areas of eastern Cameroon.On the ground, the locals say they see few changes.In Batouri, the abandoned mining pit in which Saustem Brandon Samba drowned remains open, in the same state as when the 12-year-old fell into it, his father said.“It’s not even secure,” his father Sah says. “Nothing has been done.“And there are more than 100 others like it nearby.”“The more I research it, the more I realise that people are taking advantage from people’s ignorance,” says Etoga.“If it had been a population that had been sufficiently educated, who had a good level of knowledge, it wouldn’t be happening. But there, many people don’t know anything – especially if they spend their time in the mines instead of going to school.“Some say that gold has brought us so much money, so many millions.“But if you weigh it against all that we have lost, you will see that we’ve gained nothing. Nothing at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f215f5f0fe96a982f8e629f4d2f67142d67edc87/0_2525_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf39bd690ec4145c1764ec803ba51649","title":"experience i made bombs for al qaida","story":"In 1998, two US embassies were bombed, killing 200 Africans. I no longer wanted to be part of itI grew up in Saudi Arabia, the youngest of six brothers. By the time I was 13, I had lost both my parents: my father in a traffic accident and my mother to a brain aneurysm.Not long after they died, in 1992, the Bosnian war began. The evening news detailed atrocities perpetrated against defenceless Muslims, and the papers praised the bravery of the Saudi men who went to fight alongside them. My eldest brother had lectured us on the importance of fighting in defence of Islam, and when I learned that a childhood friend had decided to join the Bosnian mujahideen, I felt someone was paving the way for me.I found the training empowering. A few weeks earlier I’d been a bookish nerd living in a conservative police state. Now I was in a training camp, high in the mountains, holding my first AK-47. It was intoxicating. I became a committed jihadist – when we were shot at, the adrenaline would take over and I’d retaliate. Always, I was willing to die. In the back of my mind, was the thought: this could be the day I cross into eternal bliss.I met al-Qaida’s Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who would go on to mastermind 911, at a wedding after the Bosnian war ended, where he spoke passionately about the need to rid the Muslim world of American influence. He persuaded me to begin training with them. Before the year was out I had met Osama bin Laden and sworn an oath of allegiance.Still only 19, I was put to work training new recruits who often lacked even basic knowledge of Islamic theology and history. Many enrolled just to escape dire poverty in Yemen. Later, I made explosives and chemical and biological weapons. I was fascinated by the science, and pushed the potential consequences out of my mind. I thought these bombs were to be used on US military bases in the Middle East, and the possibility of civilian casualties never occurred to me.When news of the bombing of two US embassies in east Africa reached us in 1998, it was a turning point – 200 innocent Africans killed just to get at 12 American diplomats. When I asked an al-Qaida leader how this had been justified, he mentioned a 700-year-old fatwa that excused the killing of civilians. I felt we were twisting our principles past breaking point. I no longer wanted to be part of it.I used a planned health check-up as a pretext for travelling to Qatar. I had no intention of returning, and it was a relief when I was arrested on arrival for suspected terrorism offences. I confessed immediately to my al-Qaida involvement – as far as I was concerned, this was fate.I was relocated to the UK for seven months of debriefings. During that time, many of my long-held beliefs were erased by the kindness I was shown. I had been trained to view westerners as animals, yet here I was having meals and lengthy discussions with decent people.When I was asked to spy on behalf of MI5 and MI6, I agreed straight away. For the next eight years, I travelled regularly between London and Afghanistan: as far as al-Qaida were concerned, I was running money and equipment and helping them recruit in the UK. Instead, I would commit information to memory and smuggled back to MI6 the designs of a device to disperse deadly chemical agents.I knew the risks, and had sleepless nights. But my time as a double agent didn’t end until 2006, when classified information about my work was leaked to journalists, and information that inadvertently blew my cover was published in Time magazine. I learned this while on holiday, when I got a text from an al-Qaida colleague saying, “There is a spy among us.” They hadn’t realised the spy was me.Eventually, a fatwa was issued against me, and three years ago security services uncovered a plot to kidnap and murder me, hatched by a former al-Qaida ally. By that time I was married and my wife was five months’ pregnant. But I have no regrets about working for the west – I know planned attacks were foiled thanks to the intelligence I gathered, and many lives were saved.I still live in the UK, and co-host a podcast using my experience to shine a light on the Middle East I also work as a security consultant. I will never feel entirely safe, but I take what precautions I can.• As told to Chris BroughtonDo you have an experience to share?

So how do they do it? Over the last few months, we’ve asked 15 couples that question – and, as Tolstoy suggested when he wrote “all happy families are alike”, there were some common themes.Almost every couple said they were each other’s closest friend. Chef David Swain said he’d always felt that way about his partner, Sarah: “I would be lost without Sarah in so many ways because I speak about everything I have on my mind to Sarah and always have.

Not just books or art or whatever, but ways of looking at things, or people that you wouldn’t normally think about talking to.” He agreed: “You don’t have to make the other person be just like you.”Marriage counselling or life coaching can definitely help but more importantly partnerships have to evolve to survive. Married for 50 years, Chardi and David Christian said a counsellor made a big difference to their relationship. “Sometimes marriages, in the way they were when you were young … have to really die for another way of being together, where you really do celebrate each other’s independence,” said Chardi, adding: “You have to find a way to love that thing you want to change most.

Over the past decade, the country has become a world leader on LGBTQ+ rights, from same-sex marriage and equal adoption, to liberal gender recognition laws for trans people. In fact, Malta was the first European country to protect people from discrimination based on gender identity or expression, and allows those who identify as neither man nor woman to use an “x” marker on official documents.The result? A place where LGBTQ+ people can live openly, and tourists can travel as their authentic selves. “I saw same-sex couples in straight bars feeling comfortable enough to kiss and honestly that always makes me happy,” Akbar recalls.Raucousness is just one part of Malta’s multifaceted LGBTQ+ offering, however, and Akbar notes that it’s also an ideal destination for a chilled holiday. “I think Malta has its own vibe, and I’d recommend it to LGBTQ+ travellers for a laid-back but queer-friendly holiday that’s inclusive.”The mix of vibrant nightlife and calm relaxation is something that 26-year-old drag performer and comedian Chucky Bartolo appreciates about Malta, too. Having been born and raised there, Bartolo recently moved to Glasgow, but returns to Malta to perform regularly. “There’s one party a month that I love called Lollipop,” which he says has grown into a huge bash over the years. “It’s thousands of people, every time.” And when LGBTQ+ travellers aren’t painting the town red, “people can lay around in Speedos, they can hold hands, kiss by the pool and no one cares. That’s great.”Bartolo recommends LGBTQ+ travellers visit the (somewhat ironically named) Strait Street, a historically flamboyant locale in the capital city of Valletta that used to be popular with sailors when Malta was under British rule. “It’s a great place, there are really cute bars and if you’re a gay couple kissing in the street, no one is going to bat an eye.”Malta’s queer nightlife doesn’t just provide a safe space for travellers and revellers, though. For Maxine Sophia Attard, a transgender performer who goes by the moniker MadameMaxxx, the queer scene also allows LGBTQ+ performers and artists to express themselves. Michelangelo, a club just outside of trendy Sliema, is one such venue Attard says their promotion and embracing of ersity has been part of what she describes as a “big improvement” in terms of people’s attitudes to the trans community in Malta. If you head to Malta this June, you’ll catch Attard “performing as the main star” at MediteRainbow, a four-day party organised by Michelangelo.While there are a number of LGBTQ+ specific venues to enjoy, Bartolo notes that “most LGBTQ+ people just go to regular clubs”, as, widely speaking, everyone has always been accommodating. “When I go out, I’ll just go out to a regular club with gay people and my female friends. Malta’s nightlife is amazing and crazy,” he says.Inclusivity isn’t something that just happens, as 31-year-old Lilla Salamon can tell you. She’s one of many straight allies who have supported the island’s LGBTQ+ community, and her Gay Guide to Malta provides “up-to-date information on what to expect in Malta during their stay”, she explains. “I had been working in marketing for 10 years, and after the Civil Union Act update in 2014 I noticed that businesses were trying to open their minds and doors to LGBTQ+ clients. They just had no idea how to do it, apart from sponsoring Pride week. With Gay Guide Malta I gave them a platform to talk to the LGBTQ+ community, both local and foreign, directly.”It would be remiss to talk about LGBTQ+ travel without mentioning Malta Pride, which has grown exponentially in the past five years, becoming a “massive, international-style Pride”, according to Bartolo. For 10 hours, the city of Valletta is closed down as everyone comes out to celebrate. There’s also a erse, week-long programme of talks and events, including LGBTQ+ inclusive football games.For Pride week, Salamon says that through Gay Guide Malta she encourages all the hotels she works with on the island to offer packages catering to LGBTQ+ travellers looking for a fun time. She also helps people who are planning same-sex weddings in the country, too. With affordable flights, it’s easy to get family members over for trips. It’s something she says has “upped the game for Malta”. “We have wedding packages,” she adds. “I only work with the best of the best. There are a lot of wedding planners in Malta and there are many who are fantastic. They also have experience with the legal side, too.”Malta is a welcoming place for LGBTQ+ travellers, but it’s also so much more. And that, Salamon believes, is ultimately what attracts people of all sexual and gender identities to the country. “Malta is a place with incredible heritage from a lot of different eras and cultures,” she explains. “And based on my experience, LGBTQ+ travellers are just looking for the same things as other travellers, only with the extra peace of mind that they won’t be treated differently.”* Not his real nameWith more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta offers more to explore"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d14625fd5001b156dabfc3f70a81c6121a392af1/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a693174140f76dde8bef51b006f5c86","title":"move over rosalia fado is the new flamenco lina raul refree","story":"Like the Catalan star modernised flamenco, musical duo Lina_Raül Refree are updating traditional Portuguese fado for the 21st centuryFor a few glorious moments at the end of January, downtown Los Angeles was enveloped by a whirlwind of Iberian fervour, as Catalan singer Rosalía brought her dazzlingly modern take on flamenco to the Grammy awards. Rosalía, who performed two songs, is the most high-profile exponent of the current flamenco revival. But she is by no means alone, with the likes of Maria Arnal i Marcel Bagés, Niño de Elche, La Favi and Califato 34 also offering modern interpretations of the flamenco sound.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Portugal, the duo Lina_Raül Refree have forged a bold new take on another traditional music, fado: a deeply melancholic style closely associated with the Portuguese idea of saudade, an untranslatable term defined by scholar Aubrey Bell as “a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist”. Even Madonna is getting in on the act: in 2019 she uploaded a fado version of Like a Virgin to her Instagram and has recently been incorporating fado into her live sets. Lina Rodrigues, whose family has sung fado for two generations, took to the genre when she was 15, releasing albums of fairly traditional fado as Carolina in 2014 and 2017. Despite this pedigree, she wanted to do something different with the style, which she says had developed “a lot of rules” over time. After she heard Barcelona guitarist Raül Refree’s work on Rosalía’s debut album, Los Ángeles, Lina’s management got in touch, hoping he could bring to fado the modern touch he had teased out of flamenco with Rosalía. Refree, who knew little about fado, was initially hesitant but went to Lisbon to see Lina sing live. The following day, they entered the studio to sound each other out. The result is an album that stays true to the emotional heft of fado while jettisoning the bright acoustic guitars that tradition demands. The duo treat their source material with respect, but experiment with instrumentation, using analogue synths, piano and occasional studio effects to give fado an eerily modern twist.

He’s not alone in his plightIf Yacouba Diabaté drives too rough over a speed bump on his way to a gig, he automatically apologizes to his instrument, secured in the backseat. The renowned cellist Lynn Harrell can see his cello from his bed and says he is effectively sleeping with it. The virtuoso Wu Man still gets upset when she thinks about the time a flight attendant dropped her pipa, a Chinese lute, in 2013. For musicians, she said, an instrument is like a baby.Wu’s painful memory is a reminder that the tight bond between a musician and their instrument frequently faces one major threat: the airline industry.This battle came to the fore last week, when the Malian musician Ballaké Sissoko accused US border officials of breaking his “impossible to replace” kora, a harp-like west African instrument, during a security check before flying from New York to Paris.The US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) denied it had broken the kora and said security agents hadn’t even inspected Sissoko’s suitcase.But in an email to the , Sissoko said: “I cannot believe what they say, because my flight case has been opened, a note from TSA was left inside, so for sure someone has opened it and has disassembled the kora that was in pieces.”Sissoko was one of several famous musicians who told the  how it is “delicate and difficult” to travel with instruments.The stakes are high. Not only does a musician have an emotional connection to their instrument, but a break, even if it is repaired to pristine condition, can bring down a valuable instrument’s price. It is also highly likely that a musician traveling with an instrument is on their way to their next gig.That was Sissoko’s first concern when he found the neck of his kora had been removed and the strings, bridge and amplification system taken apart. He is on tour, playing in London next month, and he could not simply walk into a store to replace a hand-crafted, custom instrument.Critics said Sissoko shouldn’t have checked the kora or should have put it in a specialized case, but for traditional instruments like his, that is easier said then done.Wu was traveling to Connecticut to play with the Kronos Quartet in 2013, when a flight attendant dropped her pipa.“I wanted to cry,” said Wu.Concert organizers were able to find a replacement instrument for her to borrow but she couldn’t repair her pipa until her next trip to China.Wu had only checked her pipa once, decades before, and it had broken, so she had never done it again. It is difficult to find a specialized hard case for the pipa, such as the ones people use for guitars, so even bringing it in the cabin as carry-on luggage held risk. Now, Wu often buys the pipa its own seat. “It sometimes looks ridiculous, because the seat doesn’t fit it, but you just want to be safe,” she said.To be safe, Diabaté has simply stopped doing shows abroad.Upon returning to the US in 2017, he opened his case to find the new, custom-made kora he had bought on his trip to Burkina Faso and Mali had its neck broken and the strings removed.Diabaté had bought a hard case for the instrument but was not allowed to bring it in the cabin. He knows how to make koras but said the new one was so difficult to put back together that there was no point.“It has also kept him from wanting to travel internationally because he doesn’t know what could happen, and because of what happened he doesn’t have an optimistic outlook in playing in other countries,” said his manager, Hillary Nikyema.Playing the kora is a family tradition for Diabaté, who was trained by his cousin, the renowned musician Toumani Diabaté.The kora has a deep history in Mali, where it was once only played by praise-singing poets called griots, whose role was to protect the instrument. While it is accessible to more people now, it still has deep spiritual significance to musicians like Diabaté.Nikyema and others said what had happened to Diabaté and Sissoko was equivalent to a “hate crime”.This feeling was especially strong because the incident with Sissoko, who is raising money for a new kora in an online fundraiser, happened a week after Donald Trump’s administration issued a new ban on people traveling from four African countries: Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan and Tanzania.While Nikyema said she understands most baggage handlers and security agents haven’t been exposed to a kora, she felt the damage to Sissoko and Diabaté’s instruments was so extreme she wasn’t sure damage to other foreign instruments would be prevented by providing more guidance to airline workers.“There is a difference between Africans who travel with African instruments and Europeans who travel with European instruments,” Nikyema said. “I don’t know how seriously it would be taken.”The stress of transporting instruments has been a key issue for the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), a union of 80,000 musicians in the US and Canada. “It’s been a problem for musicians as long as musicians have been on airplanes,” said Ray Hair, AFM’s international president.Hair said the union began a campaign in the late 1990s to improve rules for instruments on airplanes, but their efforts were delayed after 911. Enhanced security measures made flying with instruments even more complicatedAFM’s guide to flying with musical instruments encourages artists to purchase insurance for the instrument before travel and to notify the airline they will be flying with that instrument. They also advise artists to carry a copy of the airline’s baggage policies.Sometimes, though, the airlines bite back.There was not a world where the cellist Lynn Harrell would send his Montagnana cello, made in Venice in 1720, to the belly of the plane. Unlike with a pipa or kora, there are sophisticated hard-shell cases available to cellists, but the risk of his instrument being in the hands of a baggage handler having a bad day was too great.“We grow up knowing the instrument itself has a soul and you bond with it. You spend all those years in a practice room all alone, except for your feelings and psychology and your instrument – it has a bonding quality,” Harrell said. “So when something happens to the instrument monetarily, that’s one thing. But the feeling that as a custodian of an instrument with hundreds of years of life, you failed – that is a scar on your soul for the rest of your life.”This is why, like many cellists, Harrell buys his instrument a seat. He has been traveling internationally for more than 40 years and estimates he has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, buying a seat for himself and his cello. Given the expense and extent of his travel, he has collected airline miles for the cello under its own account for “Cello Harrell”.Then Delta Air Lines found out. In 2012, the company confiscated “Mr Cello’s” airline miles, as well as Harrell’s, and he has not flown with them since. Harrell and Mr Cello are still able to collect miles on other airlines.Harrell no longer travels with the Montagnana – he sold it for $3m in 2013 after a 50-year companionship – but he has a deep bond with the replica he had made and uses for concerts today. Harrell said he hoped passengers and airline staff who saw musicians lugging instruments through airports, strapping them into seat buckles or in overhead cabins, would understand the relationship between the two is irrevocable.“When you see someone with an instrument, recognize that to them, the instrument is almost as important as a child, as their own child,” Harrell said. “Because we make an emotional connection to it, it’s our livelihood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95969ba0c659daed958030cd9abaf31cab44332a/785_731_5070_3042/master/5070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39e5addfdb5f10807fd5b03fba2c451c","title":"the former addicts saving lives with naloxone podcast","story":"Anti-overdose drug naloxone has been in clinical use since the 1970s but not always where it’s needed most. ’s Jamie Grierson visited Redcar in North Yorkshire where a group of former drug users provide at-risk people with kits that could save their lives.

And yet Boris Johnson managed to keep an entirely straight face as he announced his intention to proceed with feasibility studies for his imaginary bridge. Some reckoned this was just a ersionary tactic – on the same day Michael Gove shamelessly admitted there would be post-Brexit border checks after months in which the government has brazenly said there wouldn’t – but there is no denying Boris’s attraction to shiny, new infrastructure projects. All of which have a habit of going wrong. When he was mayor of London, there was the Boris Island airport which disappeared under the sea and the Garden Bridge that cost £40m not to even begin construction. It would have been a lot cheaper just to pay me £20m right at the very start just to say the idea was completely ludicrous. Come to think of it make me a consultant on the Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge right now. The country will thank me in the end. Then there are the projects that did get built. The cable car that goes from nowhere in particular to nowhere in particular and is used by almost no one. Crossrail that is massively over budget and three years – and counting – late. So the prospects for HS2, which is already £80bn over budget and spectacularly late even before a mile of track has been laid, don’t seem exactly promising. But thrilled to be writing the biggest cheque in the UK’s history, Boris has given the project the go-ahead. At least, the section up to Crewe. The rest may be later downgraded to regular track if it gets built at all. Still, by then Boris will be long gone and someone else will be left to pick up the pieces.A new survey has come up with a list of people’s biggest regrets. The top five are wishing you had saved more when you were younger, not keeping in touch with old friends, not taking the plunge in a romance, not travelling when you had fewer responsibilities and not pursuing a better-paid job. Maybe I am unusual here, but only one of these really applies to me. I do profoundly regret not making more time for old friends and family, especially those who have died and for whom it is too late to let them know how much I loved them. The other regrets, not so much. I never had much money to save in the first place, though what I did have I could have spent a great deal more wisely and creatively. But that’s another story. I’ve never felt as if I’ve missed out by not having travelled more – I much prefer going to the same places with the same people over and over again. I’ve also never wished I’d chased the big bucks: I consider myself lucky to do the job I have. Enjoying my work has been one of the unexpected bonuses of my life, not least because for a long time the idea of even having a career – let alone one I enjoyed – seemed inconceivable. But most of all I have no feelings of regret for the love affairs that never happened. Quite the reverse, in fact. Just a sense of massive relief. Not just because I love my wife and our children. But also because I can’t help feeling that I may have dodged a bullet. Back in the day, I wasn’t always the best judge of a partner nor the best prospect, and my relationships invariably ended badly. And if I didn’t dodge a bullet, then the women certainly did. Put it like this. I wouldn’t have gone out with me, so I see no reason why anyone else should have wanted to. Thankfully, my wife made an exception. She, of course, may have her own regrets ...Even before I reached an age at which actuarial tables became a matter of personal rather than academic interest, Jeanne Calment’s story had long been an object of fascination. Calment was born in the Provençal town of Arles in February 1875 and died there 122 years, five months and 14 days later in 1997, by which time she was officially the oldest woman to have ever lived. And she still holds that record. Some scientists may now reckon that the person who will live to 150 has already been born and that reaching 100 will soon become normal, but the 7 billion-plus people on the planet have still got a way to go before someone inches past Calment. Only it now turns out that Jeanne may not have been Jeanne after all. A gripping story in the New Yorker reports that some gerontologists have now become sceptical about her longevity. They have both examined photos of her at the age of 110 and concluded that she has the physical attributes of someone under 90 and found serious time-shifts and lacunae in her life story. Rather than having met Van Gogh in 1888, they think that Jeanne may actually have been her daughter Yvonne, who was reported to have died of tuberculosis in 1934. Their suggestion is that it was Jeanne who died of TB and that, to avoid inheritance tax, her husband, Freddy, passed off her body as that of their daughter Yvonne, and that Yvonne happily went along with it. As presumably did half of Arles who must have noticed that Jeanne had become a lot younger since her daughter had died. It all sounds highly improbable, though perhaps no more so than the chances of outliving by at least five years everyone who had ever been born in human history. In any case the French, who are extremely proud of Jeanne’s legacy, are vigorously defending her posthumous honour. I’d like to believe Jeanne, if only for the hope she offers. Though I’m not sure I quite fancy making it through to the age of 122 myself. Rather depends on how many of my family and friends are still live and how well Spurs are playing.If one of the first rules of politics is to anticipate your opponent’s next step, then Boris Johnson’s ministerial reshuffle has to go down as a partial cock-up. Having been pleasantly surprised at how accommodating Sajid Javid had been over the previous six months, Boris and Dominic Cummings had clearly expected the chancellor to just roll over when he was informed that from now on all his special advisers would be sacked and that the Treasury would be run from No 10. But, right at the last and rather unexpectedly, Sajid turned out to have some self-respect, so Boris was blindsided into appointing the 12-year-old Rishi Sunak, who clearly doesn’t. That aside, though, Boris and Dom are probably looking back at a decent day’s work. Old scores were settled, competent ministers were replaced with yes men and women, as well as unelected peers and, moments after the culture secretary had been unable to take departmental questions for a second time as she was otherwise engaged in the Lords, there was no attorney general to answer attorney general questions. Taking back control has rarely looked so anti-democratic. It’s begun to look as if Boris and Dom are actively trolling the country to see what they can get away with.Organisation has never been my strongest point – it’s always a major achievement to get the car its MOT on time – but I can safely say that I can always remember who paid for my holidays. Especially if it’s one that I went on little more than a month previously. It’s me and my wife. Just as it has been for the last 30 something years. But curiously, Boris Johnson finds this rather more problematic. In the register of members’ interests, he has listed his £15K new year break as a gift from Carphone Warehouse millionaire and Tory party donor David Ross. Only it turns out that Ross says he didn’t pay for it at all, he merely discovered the availability of a vacant villa with five servants. Boris’s subsequent clarification – “Mr Ross facilitated accommodation for Mr Johnson on Mustique valued at £15K. Therefore this is a benefit in kind from Mr Ross to Mr Johnson and Mr Johnson’s declaration to the House of Commons is correct” – has only muddied the waters. This rather suggests that I should have listed Airbnb as a benefit in kind when we went to Minneapolis last summer. Boris then said he had no idea who owned the villa and who had paid. It was just one of those unaccountable windfalls that have a habit of landing in his lap. Further investigations have revealed the villa is owned by a Mrs Richardson, though she has no record of who paid the £15K. Somehow it just landed in her bank account and it would be rude to check who made the transfer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502c90396bcee4d31f25b3cec960b99e6705fc95/0_0_6948_4169/master/6948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7905643344312dab4c8260ebafd7c989","title":"back to the future why are we opting for nostalgic pop culture","story":"From rewatching 1990s TV shows to replaying classic computer games, taking the safe option when it comes to entertainment can help audiences rediscover themselvesNever before has civilisation produced so much new pop culture. From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Many of these were as a result of outbreaks in universities and colleges, and most were in young adults who did not have the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) jab.A large number of the 2019 cases were people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s who missed out on the MMR vaccine when they were children.Public Health England (PHE) is urging people to have both parts of the vaccine, saying the full two doses are needed to maximise protection. The vaccine prevents most, though not all, cases of mumps.There were also increases in mumps cases in Scotland and Wales last year.Dr Vanessa Saliba, of PHE, said it was never too late to catch up on immunisation. “We encourage all students and young people who may have missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past to contact their GP practice and get up to date as soon as possible,” she told the BBC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9476e818a034ff0eecd38103cd055353fc46060b/292_210_3826_2296/master/3826.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29e262a3856b94a32f8700a7973853ef","title":"amy hunt british teenage sprinter record books","story":"Barely a month after her 17th birthday last summer, the British sprinter Amy Hunt ran a 200 metres so fast that her spikes were actually smouldering as she crossed the finish line. And so, emphatically, were the record books. Hunt’s time of 22.42 secs in Mannheim in June not only broke the women’s Under-18 world record – the men’s version is held by a certain Usain Bolt – and was the third fastest ever by a British woman, but it would have also won a bronze medal behind Dina Asher-Smith at the recent world championships.“It was 39c that day in Germany and honestly my feet were so hot that my spikes melted a little,” says Hunt, laughing. “It was my overriding memory. I don’t remember what happened between 50m and 150m – it was all a bit of a blur. Afterwards I went back and told my coach that I never believed I would run a time like that, but he immediately replied that I did!”As for those comparisons with Bolt, Hunt modestly says it is too early to draw any conclusions. “It’s just incredible to think that at my age I am on a par with him and hopefully I can go on to achieve the same sort of success,” she adds.But Hunt is clearly a special talent. On the track a whirlwind 2019 ended with Hunt winning a European Under-20 gold medal, being named young female athlete of the year by the British Athletics Writers Association and getting snapped up by the blue-chip sports agency that represents Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Laura Muir.Off it, the A-Level student from Nottinghamshire was recently offered a place at the University of Cambridge to study English – her favourite authors are Charlotte Bronte, Henry James and Chaucer – while also finding the time to play the cello to grade six standard.Hunt, though, is confident she can juggle academia with life as a professional athlete – as Asher-Smith did early in her career – and eventually challenge for world and Olympic titles.“If you are going to put that much hard work and effort into something, you have to be very clear about why you are doing it and what you are working towards,” she says. “And I am training to one day become Olympic champion. But my team and I know that I have to be really sensible about progressions, and not try to do everything all at once.”Hunt missed the opportunity to qualify for the 2019 world championships due to a minor injury. However she has fully recovered and believes she will be stronger this season after a good winter in the gym.On Saturday she takes another step in her fledgling career when she faces the 100m world champion, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, and the world indoor champion, Murielle Ahouré, over 60m at the Glasgow indoor grand prix.“In terms of profile, this is probably the biggest race of my career,” she says. “It will be really surreal to be racing Shelly-Ann because she has been one of those huge idols that I have looked up to since I was a young child.”That is certainly true given Hunt was only five when the Jamaican won her first Olympic title in 2008. However she insists she won’t be overawed. “My number one target is to enjoy it, embrace everything, and live in the moment. That’s what I did last year in Mannheim and it worked really well.”Might another personal best be on the cards? “Hopefully. My coach and I are expecting to run something fast.”Whatever happens it will put her in good stead for a year that will involve a crack at the world junior championships and, if she qualifies, potentially the Tokyo Olympics.“I am doing my A-levels this year, and that is pretty important for me,” she says. “And competition-wise we are looking towards world juniors first. Obviously it is an Olympic year too so we are definitely not ruling that out. But I know I can’t rely on times you have run in the past. I have to go out and replicate them.”Another dilemma Hunt faces is whether to go to Cambridge or Loughborough for university this autumn, a decision complicated by the fact she already trains at Loughborough. “I am not sure what I will do yet,” she admits. “There’s a lot of logistics to work out – it is a bit of a tough one given Cambridge is about an hour and thirty minute drive away.”It’s a nice choice to have, as she concedes, before revealing that things could have easily turned out differently. When she first joined an athletics club she was originally “shoved into the middle distance group”.“Because I was tall, lanky and spindly they told me I wasn’t going to be a sprinter even though I told them I was quick and the school had sent me,” Hunt laughs. “But by the end of the year I was top of the under-13 rankings without really doing any serious training. That made me think that athletics was something I could go into – and the following year I won the English schools championships.”What kind of cross-country runner was she? “I did it for a couple of years – I think I made it to Anglians but I never made it to English schools,” she admits. “I hated every second!”Luckily life in the fast lane has proved much more to Hunt’s liking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edcf9e753042e090e7dc440fc141c38f3ca039fa/381_790_5083_3049/master/5083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=760c274d34b3f7ea839ce9cbb524bd01","title":"this country bbc cotswolds residents kerry kurtan","story":"As the BBC mockumentary returns to our screens, Kerry and Kurtan’s real-life neighbours open up on the show’s portrayal of rural problemsThe tourist information site for Northleach focuses on attractions such as the magnificent 15th-century church of St Peter and St Paul and the annual charter fair, which has been held for the best part of 800 years.But today’s visitors to the Cotswolds town are just as likely to come looking for spots associated with a much more contemporary phenomenon: the award-winning BBC mockumentary This Country, which is back for its third and final series on Monday.“The fans come right up to the front door and pose for pictures,” said Sophie Anning, whose corner house is one of those used by the programme makers, doubling as the home of the scariest character, Big Mandy. “I don’t really mind. Most of them are very polite. When the BBC people first came and asked if they could use my house, I thought it was going to be like Shameless and I wasn’t sure I wanted to be involved. But it turned out much better than I thought. It’s good old British humour but also real. Everyone knows a Kerry and a Kurtan.”The comedy is written by and stars siblings Daisy May Cooper and Charlie Cooper as cousins Kerry and Lee “Kurtan” Mucklowe, tracking their trials and tribulations in an unnamed Cotswolds village. But it is not just played for laughs. The characters’ struggles with boredom, isolation, loneliness and deprivation can be a difficult watch.Emma Hanks, whose front path was the setting for an awkward tussle between Kurtan and a love rival, said it was an accurate portrayal of life for some people in a place like Northleach. “I’m born and bred here,” she said. “When you’re young, you’re slumming around, trying to find work. It’s hard even to get anywhere because the buses are absolutely useless.”“It is like real life,” said Maureen Hilder, 80, a retired school canteen worker whose home stands in for Kurtan’s nan’s place. “It shows how kids carry on. I was a bit shocked by the swearing at first but as long as the little ones don’t see it I think that’s all right.”Cllr Paul Hodgkinson, the Liberal Democrat member for Northleach and Bourton-on-the-Wateron Gloucestershire county council, said the show shone a light on aspects of life in the Cotswolds that were often hidden.“There’s a rosy view of the Cotswolds as beautiful playground for the rich and famous, full of tourists. Some of that is true. But there’s hidden stuff too: rural poverty, a lack of services, antisocial behaviour. The show brings that out.”Research carried out for the town’s neighbourhood plan sets out – with less pathetic humour – some of the issues brought to life in This Country.The age profile for the town is older than the average and the number of people who are economically active smaller. Public transport is poor and the nearest train station is 14 miles away. There are around 2,000 residents but Northleach has lost its hospital, banks, petrol station and secondary school. The primary school is the biggest employer.Wealthy, older incomers have sent prices spiralling – a very plain house in the neighbourhood where Kurtan and Kerry supposedly live goes for almost £300,000 – much more than a local person in an average job could afford.Some residents have taken against the show. One woman would deliberately park her Land Rover in front of the cameras to try to stop filming. Rather than being upset by the verbal abuse they have received, the Coopers have instead incorporated some of the barbs into their dialogue.The end of the show will be mourned by many. Paula Neate, who lives in another small West Country town, says she felt much more self-confident after watching the show. She got involved with a community of fans, and even met Daisy May Cooper at a charity football match.She even plucked up the courage to make a “pilgrimage” to Northleach. “This Country has contributed hugely to me changing,” she said. “I have gone the best part of my life with very little confidence.“The community centred around This Country are an amazing, welcoming group of people and no-one judges anyone, which is so refreshing. I had wanted to visit Northleach since the first series. Although I did feel a bit awkward, the locals were warm and lovely.”The Coopers are from Cirencester, 10 miles south of Northleach down the Fosse Way. When they staged a hometown preview of series three in their hometown, 25,000 people applied for the 400 tickets. The town’s population is only 19,000.One of the reasons they have decided to stop is that they can no longer eavesdrop for new material at pubs or bus stops because they are too recognisable and people clam up.Stephen Wilson, the landlord of the Sherborne Arms (which doubles as The Keepers in the show) said his pub had done good business on the back of This Country.“We have people coming to the pub from all over the UK after watching the show. They do that because they recognise it is true. It’s not vindictive or nasty. It’s understanding of the way people are.”Wilson believes there is still a rich, deep seam of comedy to mine in Northleach. “I see it all going on here,” he said. “If they came and sat quietly in a corner in here, they’d soon have enough material for another six series.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9784acc29fce1ab66da39c9ecf1d3f30afe188/0_233_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c3d1be6092684e9e2e61914cbb84eeb","title":"wetsuweten coastal gaslink pipeline allies","story":"Justin Trudeau under increasing pressure even as some politicians decry ‘hard-left ideology’Rows of red dresses hung from a fishing line slung across the road, and from pine and spruce trees in the surrounding forest – each one a memorial to the thousands of Indigenous women killed or disappeared in recent years.A pair of helicopters buzzed overhead, but on the ground, the women’s voices and drums drowned out the officers as they warned them to leave or face arrest.“We remained in ceremony – even as the tactical officers surrounded us and began pick off iniduals,” said one of the women, Dr Karla Tait.Set amid dense evergreen forests near the bank of the Wedzin Kwah, or Morice River, the remote cabins at Unist’ot’en camp have become a place of healing for Indigenous youth, who take lessons on trapping and traditional medicines.But the camp in north-western British Columbia is also the last line of defence in the Wet’suwet’en nation’s fight against a controversial natural gas pipeline.The long-simmering conflict came to a head this week, as Canada’s national police force deployed helicopters, armed officers and dogs to enforce a court injunction and clear Indigenous activists who had been blocking work crews from the route of the C$6.6bn (US$5bn) Coastal GasLink project.Twenty-eight people were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, including three Wet’suwet’en matriarchs – Tait, Freda Huson and Brenda Michell.“I felt overwhelmed with sadness, and pain over the fact that we were being removed from our territory,” said Tait, remembering the moment she was escorted past the fluttering red dresses towards a police vehicle. She made sure to touch each dress as she left.But she and the other “land defenders” remain defiant. Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs, who oversee 22,000 sq km of territory, have stubbornly opposed the project and remain locked in a battle with the courts, the pipeline company – and the government of Justin Trudeau.And in recent days, their fight has been taken up by other groups across the country.For more than a week, members of the Tyendinaga Mohawk have blocked freight and commuter rail traffic in Ontario, in support of the Wet’suwet’en. Elsewhere, protestors have blocked roads, barricaded access to shipping ports and occupied the offices of elected officials in a wave of dissent.Late on Thursday, Canadian National Railway, the country’s largest freight operator, said it was shutting down its operations in the east of the country due to the continuing blockade, and warned of temporary layoffs. Soon after, Via Rail, which operates much of Canada’s passenger rail service, said its entire service would be suspended until further notice.Climate action groups have also taken up the cause of the Wet’suwet’en, seeing their fight as part of a broader one against resource extraction projects in the country.The demonstrations have piled pressure on Canada’s prime minister, who has vaunted his commitment to ersity and tackling the deep-rooted inequities facing Indigenous peoples.“Trudeau has gone to the United Nations to shed tears about the history of Canada’s relationship with indigenous people,” said Tait. “And on the other hand, he’s essentially authorizing the use of force against our unarmed people for upholding our rights.”This week, Trudeau has expressed his support for peaceful protest – but also criticised the rail blockades.Amid pleas from business leaders for a swift end to the crisis, other politicians have been even more outspoken in their condemnation.In Alberta – a province whose economy relies on oil and gas – the conservative premier, Jason Kenney, has warned that the current unrest is a “dress rehearsal” for future opposition to fossil-fuel based projects.“This is not about Indigenous people. It’s not about carbon emissions. It’s about a hard-left ideology that is, frankly, opposed to the entire modern industrial economy,” said Kenney. “It’s about time that our police services demonstrated that this is a country that respects the rule of law.”And after protesters barricaded the entrance to British Columbia’s legislative assembly, the province’s premier, John Horgan, called the demonstrations a “shift from traditional protest – to something quite different”.Molly Wickham, a spokesperson for the Wet’suwet’en who also has the hereditary name Sleydo’, agreed. “Indigenous people see what’s happening to us and see what’s happening to our territory and our pristine waters – and to our people on the ground, having semiautomatic weapons aimed at us,” she said. “People are responding to that in appropriate ways.”More than just a row over a pipeline, the Wet’suwet’en protests also reflect Canada’s often fraught relationship with First Nations.“Ever since colonization, the aim has been to dispossess our people from our lands. To impoverish us. To assimilate us. To eliminate us,” said Tait. “We know that our self-determination, our sovereignty, our very identity, is based on us having control over our lands.”In November, British Columbia became the first province in Canada to pass legislation promising to uphold the United Nations declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples. But such promises seem empty in the wake of recent police actions, said Wickham.“There were tactical teams walking around with semi-automatic weapons in my territory. Industry was allowed to come and go freely. White settlers were allowed to come and go freely,” she said. “But if you were a Wet’suwet’en person, you are not permitted on your own territory.”Controversy around the Coastal GasLink project has been compounded by questions over who has the right to speak for the Wet’suwet’en.Coastal GasLink has signed benefit agreements with the 20 elected First Nations councils along the route, including five of the six elected band councils in the Wet’suwet’en nation. But Wet’suwet’en chiefs say the authority of these groups only applies to reservations – not traditional territory where the pipeline is proposed.The Wet’suwet’en nation have lived on their territories in what is now British Columbia for thousands of years. They have never signed treaties or sold their land to Canada.\u0026nbspWith a\u0026nbsppopulation\u0026nbspof about 5,000, the Wet’suwet’en\u0026nbspare composed of five clans (Gilseyhu, Likhts’amisyu, Laksilyu, Tsayu and Gidimt’en), which are further ided into 13 house groups, each with its own distinct territories.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Unist’ot’en, the People of the Headwaters, belong to the Gilseyhu clan.\u0026nbspHereditary chiefs are responsible for the health and sustainability of their house group territories, and Wet’suwet’en law prohibits trespass on the territory of other the house groups.\u0026nbspWet’suwet’en people have retained their legal traditions and continue to govern themselves through the Bahtlats (feast hall), where decisions are ratified and clan business is conducted.Unlike in much of Canada – where relationships between First Nations and the state are governed by treaties – few aboriginal nations in British Columbia ever signed deals with colonial authorities, meaning the federal government still operates in a vacuum of authority on their lands.In 1997, the Wet’suwet’en and Gitxsan nations won a landmark case in which the supreme court ruled that their aboriginal title had not been extinguished when Canada became a country. But the case did not establish the boundaries of that title and the court suggested subsequent cases would be needed to settle the issue.“Aboriginal title claims of the Wet’suwet’en people have yet to be resolved either by negotiation or litigation,” wrote the justice Marguerite Church in her decision to grant Coastal GasLink the injunction. “While Wet’suwet’en customary laws clearly exist on their own independent footing, they are not recognized as being an effectual part of Canadian law.”Legal experts believe the Wet’suwet’en would probably have a strong case to establish title to the land in the courts, enabling them to better fight the project. But such cases can take decades to adjudicate and cost millions of dollars, a prospect Tait called “insufficient” given the pipeline’s imminent construction.For those on the front lines of the fight, the nationwide support is a vindication that the long-simmering frustrations over land claims and a fraught Indigenous relationship with the state are facing a long-overdue reckoning.“This is far from over,” said Wickham. “We’ve had day after day of invasion and we’re still here.

Photograph: ReutersIrish diplomats assumed the British government listened to all their communications with Dublin during the 1980s, former officials say.Speaking after the revelation that the Irish government unwittingly used an encryption machine from a CIA-owned company, former diplomats stationed in Northern Ireland and elsewhere told The  it was no secret foreign agencies had easy access to Irish phone and text communications.The equipment, which was manufactured by the Swiss company Crypto AG, gave the US intelligence agency, and consequently their British equivalent, access to encrypted messages during the sensitive period leading up to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.The equipment was viewed as top of the range by Irish officials. “The view at the time was the Swiss made the best equipment,” said one former official who worked in the London embassy for a period.However, all former officials who spoke to The  said it was assumed at all times their communications were compromised.“So while the CIA ownership of Crypto AG may be a new detail, it is only a detail which does not affect the big picture.”Michael Lillis, who helped negotiate the Anglo-Irish Agreement and worked in the Anglo-Irish secretariat in Antrim known as “the Bunker”, said they knew “everything” was being intercepted by the British codebreaking agency GCHQ. Mr Lillis said the British had both the capacity and motive to listen to sensitive Irish communications around the time of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.GCHQThe British did not need to solely rely on the CIA to pass on intercepted communications. In the 1980s and 1990s GCHQ also used facilities in Cheshire, Cornwall and Armagh to listen to telephone and electronic communications from Irish government officials.Even the British sometimes failed to keep up the pretence that they were not listening to Irish communications. Mr Lillis said a British counterpart, who wanted the agreement to be a success, told him that “every single word” was being intercepted by GCHQ.There were also signs the problems may have stemmed from the use of compromised encryption systems, said Mr Ó hUigínn. “In fact I heard from the department’s folklore that there were occasional hints from friendly British contacts not to rely overmuch on whatever was said on the tin in relation to our encryption systems.”Indeed, Irish officials sometimes used this to their advantage. “Sometimes we wanted them to hear what we were saying,” said Mr Lillis. In these situations officials would speak in Irish or add extra encryption to their messages to signal to the British they contained particularly sensitive information and they should pay attention to it.The British codebreakers got so good at Irish that when Mr Lillis passed on the text of an agreement in Irish to his opposite number, they came back with several corrections.For any genuinely sensitive communications from Northern Ireland, couriers were used, Mr Lillis said. “We kept using our technology but we knew it was compromised.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4173163.1581632212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord a very strange situation including gerry adams his plo scarf and bee gees hair","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWith his PLO scarf, hopalong foot, Bee-Gees hair and sweat shirt emblazoned with the image of Mexican revolutionary Emialiano Zapata, Gerry Adams somehow managed to be the centre of attention. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsIn this Manx flag of an election aftermath, three equal legs of competing parties spin continuously towards they know not what. They may be spinning for some time. Perhaps, some fear, to no conclusion. It’s a very strange situation. Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, caught in a three-way tie after Saturday’s general election. How can a government emerge from the confusion?The first working week since that game-changing vote is nearing an end. The big three are still coming to terms with the results, along with the smaller parties and independents also caught up in the political conundrum. Everyone is exhausted. An elated Sinn Féin, having even surprised itself with a stellar performance at the ballot box, is still flying on the fumes of success. The smiling Greens and SocDems are also operating on adrenalin. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are still traumatised. But one thing never changes in Leinster House – the evergreen mantra of politicians from all parties and none was pressed into action as soon as the weary troops returned to Kildare Street: Nobody wants an election at this point in time. Sinn Féin TDs, having convincingly secured the most votes from an electorate hell-bent on demanding a change in how the country is run and how politics is done, say the people expressly gave them a mandate to govern and, effectively, the keys to Government Buildings. But party realists know the seat numbers don’t add up for them, even with the addition of smaller parties and a rag-tag assortment of independents. One of the other two main parties must come on board.Playing it coolFine Gael has blankly refused and is not for turning. Fianna Fáil has categorically ruled out Sinn Féin too. On Thursday in Leinster House, among the dazed but delighted newbies exploring the complex and the hurt and downcast former deputies wandering the precincts, Fine Gael was gone to ground, Fianna Fáil was sequestered in a basement, windowless room and Sinn Féin’s new, expanded Dáil team was busy stealing a march on them by grabbing all the attention and shouting loudly about an “appetite for change”.In a scenario where the Dáil seat numbers don’t add up to compile a working majority, optics are hugely important. Mary Lou McDonald marshalled her forces (with added Gerry Adams along for a gawk) and led them on their maiden voyage across the plinth following a parliamentary party meeting across the road in Buswells hotel. It seems some of the new TDs were only meeting colleagues for the first time, with a lot of hurried introductions going on. Journalists were allowed into the packed Georgian Room to hear the leader’s speech, although the party press office had clarified the previous evening that the meeting itself was private and a question and answer session with Mary Lou would be facilitated back at Leinster House later on in the afternoon. This is not particularly unusual, despite a Daily Mail journalist getting very hot under the collar over this disgraceful attempt to curtail press freedom. Republican dittyA deep voice rose from a seat along the wall near the top of the room. “The Man from the Daily Mail,” boomed Gerry Adams. This was a reference to a republican ditty of the same name, and of the type which might have been sung by a victorious Sinn Féin TD after an election count until intimations of government curtailed the singing of IRA songs in polite society.The former Sinn Féin leader is still wearing an immobilisation boot following an iPad related accident. Gerry was at home writing with his iPad resting on his leg. He became so absorbed in his task the leg went to sleep and when he stood up his ankle buckled and he broke a bone in his foot. With his PLO scarf, hopalong foot, Bee-Gees hair and sweat shirt emblazoned with the image of Mexican revolutionary Emialiano Zapata, Adams somehow managed to be the centre of attention without being the centre of attention. As always, deputy leader Michelle O’Neill was brought along for the occasion. How the Sinn Féin’s leader in Stormont manages to get anything done up North these days is a mystery. It seems Mary Lou McDonald isn’t allowed to take part in any major public event without poor Michelle (who rarely gets a chance to open her mouth) being dragged along as the Northern Irish mascot. The leader’s Buswell speech was supposed to rally the troops, but it was really designed to cast Fianna Fáil as a bunch of wimps who haven’t the bottle to go into government with Sinn Féin, as the people demanded, because they have no “appetite for change”. Well, Micheál Martin, do you have what it takes? Do you? Is Fianna Fáil up to it? Are you up to it?And should Fianna Fáil not go into coalition with Mary Lou in the end, let the people remember she gave them every chance. . .If this were a sprint, Micheál and his team would have been on the back foot. But this is a long game. Anybody But Sinn FéinBack in Leinster House, while one of the Manx Flag three was out cavorting for the cameras and making entrance after big entrance, Fianna Fáil TDs were queuing up to get out the message that they will talk to anybody about putting a government together, except Sinn Féin.ABSF. Anybody But Sinn Féin. And almost all members the new, slimmed down, parliamentary party, stuck to the line. They met for four hours, downstairs in Leinster House 2000 in a room which, it was hoped by the handlers, might not have a decent mobile phone signal. It didn’t matter, because TDs just had to nip out to the coffee dock where they could tell any number of the hacks hanging around what was going on. It was apparently a very “constructive” meeting and nobody had a bad word to say about the party leader and even John McGuinness, who they all thought would blow a gasket, was very “constructive”.Micheál broke his self-imposed isolation to go on the evening news. “Any government formed has to be sustainable,” he said. Clearly a blatant attempt to woo the Greens. “I wouldn’t rule out another general election, this is going to be so difficult.” The Taoiseach, meanwhile, was out and about doing Taoiseachy things. He arrived in the lobby of Leinster House at teatime to sign the roll to activate his membership of the 33rd Dáil. Leo Varadkar looked very relaxed in his jeans and casual shirt, sipping a can of Diet Coke as he chatted to staff. Former Labour party leader Pat Rabbitte was in on business. He’s loving the intrigue and excitement. “It really is a very unusual situation,” he mused. “Fianna Fáil is trying to get into government and Fine Gael is trying to get into opposition.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail Full results and counts for the 39 election constituencies.

The overall death toll now stands at 1,380 and infections have topped 64,000.However, more than 5,000 new cases were reported on Friday, dampening hopes that the virus will soon be contained and leading to calls from senior officials to step up quarantine measures similar to the draconian lockdown of Wuhan.The fluctuations in China’s official figures, including a huge leap in numbers after clinical diagnostic methods were altered mid-week, has heightened concerns about Beijing’s handling of the crisis and the accuracy of vital data.China’s capital has been shrouded in smog despite reduced emissions from coronavirus economic slowdown, the South China Morning Post reports.The United States Embassy said Beijing’s PM2.5 levels were as high as 240 micrograms per cubic metre on Thursday, more than 10 times the World Health Organisation’s recommended level of 25.Smog-blanketed skies are not uncommon in Beijing over winter, but this week’s air pollution came when emissions from industry and traffic – the two major contributors – were subdued.Singapore reports nine new coronavirus cases, taking tally to 67.According to the Straits Times, six of the new cases are linked to the Grace Assembly of God church.This takes the total number of cases thought to be connected to the church up to 13, now the biggest cluster of confirmed cases in Singapore .Shares in AstraZeneca dropped as much as 6.3pc this morning before paring some losses, after the pharma giant warned coronavirus could push back an awaited jump in profits.The group said its 2020 revenues would likely increase by a “high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage”, assuming an “unfavourable impact from China lasting up to a few months” as a result of the deadly outbreak.There were jubilant scenes in Cambodia on Friday morning as passengers on a cruise ship that was barred from ports across Asia amid coronavirus fears were finally able to disembark, writes Sarah Newey.The country’s strongman premier, Hun Sen, flew in by helicopter to welcome passengers with flowers and scarves as they left the Westerdam cruise ship following two uncertain weeks at sea. Christina Kerby - who has been tweeting light-hearted updates from the ship since the ordeal started - said she was “in tears” over the warm reception at the Cambodian sea port of Sihanoukville.Overjoyed passengers used their new-found freedom to visit a nearby beach, while some even hugged Hun Sen - who has ruled the country for 35 years. One man kissed the ground as he left the ship, which had turned into a floating prison. Passenger John Miller from Seattle, Washington is overwhelmed with excitement disembarking from the MS Westerdam cruise ship after being stranded for two weeks now dockedMeanwhile Hun Sen relished in the positive focus on his leadership - which is more often criticised for a poor record on human rights. Cambodia pays more attention to human rights... we respect the rights of the more than 2,000 people on the boat, Hun Sen said.

and it can change human behaviour to take greater risks, he said.Examples of risky behaviour during infectious disease outbreaks include not washing hands, sharing food with ill people, not disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces, and failing to self-isolate.Worryingly, people are more likely to share bad advice on social media, than good advice from trusted sources such as the NHS, Public Health England or the World Health Organisation.It comes as it emerged the woman who is the UK\u0027s ninth case of coronavirus took an Uber to A\u0026ampE after she developed symptoms.The unnamed woman, who is being treated at a specialist NHS centre at Guy\u0027s and St Thomas\u0027, contracted the virus in China before flying to the UK.Two staff from Lewisham hospital in south London are now in isolation at home after coming into contact with the woman.The Department of Health said on Thursday that 2,521 people in the UK have been tested, of whom 2,512 were confirmed negative and nine positive.In China, the number of deaths from coronavirus has reached 1,380, with more than 63,000 recorded infections, in figures announced early on Friday morning.Some 44 more people on quarantined cruise ship the Diamond Princess in Japan have tested positive for Covid-19 disease.

On February 10, he bought the equivalent of 216 rolls of toilet paper on Amazon Inc. after his family tried in vain for days to find any in Hong Kong. The shipping alone cost $200 but he thinks it was worth it.Japanese airline crew wearing masks to prevent the coronavirus infectionThe coronavirus outbreak could mean a reduction of $4-5 billion in worldwide airline revenue, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) said on Thursday.The UN agency reported that 70 airlines have cancelled all international flights in and out of China and 50 others have reduced their operations.Preliminary estimates show this has meant a reduction of nearly 20 million passengers compared to expectations for the first quarter of 2020.That figure equates to potential lost revenue of up to $5 billion, the agency said.Japan looks to be hardest-hit from a reduction in Chinese air travellers in the first quarter, ICAO said. The country could lose $1.29 billion in tourism revenue, with Thailand not far behind at a $1.15 billion loss potential.ICAO said the effects of the COVID-19 virus outbreak on the airline industry are expected to be larger than the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic because flight cancellations are more widespread this time.In addition, China\u0027s international air traffic has doubled and its domestic air traffic increased five-fold in the last 17 years.Mall landlords in Hong Kong are offering cuts in February rentAsian shares edged up on Friday, on course to post the second straight week of gains, helped by hopes governments will make provisions to soften the impact on their economies from the coronavirus epidemic  China\u0027s economy will grow at its slowest rate in the current quarter since the financial crisis, a Reuters poll showed.The epidemic could shave up to 0.2 percentage points off Japan\u0027s economic growth this year, another Reuters poll showed.Kim Jong-un has cancelled a military parade in Pyongyang, provoking rumours that he is trying to contain a outbreak of the virusThe United States is deeply concerned about the vulnerability of the North Korean people to a coronavirus outbreak, a State Department spokeswoman said.North Korea is adamant that there have been no cases of the virus within its borders, despite reports of cases by South Korean media outlets and amid rumours of deathsMorgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman, tweeted: The US stands ready and is prepared to expeditiously facilitate the approval of assistance from US and international aid organizations to counter and contain the spread of #coronavirus in response to concerns about the vulnerability of the people of North Korea.Shinzo Abe said Japan would expand its testing proceduresJapan has vowed to step up testing and containment efforts for the coronavirus after suffering its first death and the confirmation of new cases, including a doctor and taxi driver.Japan\u0027s health ministry said that a woman in her 80s living in Kanagawa prefecture, just to the west of Tokyo, had died. She was transferred between hospitals as her condition worsened and was only confirmed to have the coronavirus after her death. A Tokyo taxi driver, who Japanese media said was the woman\u0027s son-in-law, as well as a man in his 20s from Tokyo and a doctor in Wakayama, western Japan, were also confirmed to have the virus.We will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread of the illness, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.

China is basically shut down right now.Tokyo stocks opened lower on Friday amid lingering worries over the impact of the coronavirus on the global and Japanese economy.The benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 0.51 per cent, or 122.01 points, to 23,705.72 in early trade, while the broader Topix index was down 0.54 per cent, or 9.23 points, at 1,703.85.Hun Sen passed flowers to the passengersPassengers aboard the MS Westerdam have started to disembark the ship after Cambodia yesterday offered safe harbour.1,455 passengers and 802 crew members, none of whom are thought to be sick with coronavirus, have been stuck onboard having been turned away from Guam, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines.Passengers long stranded cheered as they were welcomed to Cambodia by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who handed them flowers.How wonderful it is to be here.

The\u0026nbspFTSE\u0026nbsp100 has a lot of those\u0026nbspInvestment funds that aim to follow or “track” the performance of a designated stock market index, as opposed to trying to beat it, are inexpensive, easy to understand and hugely popular, especially amongst novice investors.\u0026nbspWith good reason. Most of the time they outperform so called actively managed funds run by stock pickers which too rarely beat the markets they\u0027re benchmarked against after their higher costs are factored in.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut trackers pose a problem for people who are concerned enough about the climate crisis to want to green up their investments.\u0026nbspA tracker investor\u0026nbspis inevitably exposed to most, or all, of the constituents of the index their chosen fund tracks. So they have to take the rough with the smooth. Sometimes the rough is very rough indeed from the perspective of planet earth.Britain’s premier stock market index is, for example, chock full of natural resource companies.

So if, say, BP does well, they do well.\u0026nbspTalk about carrying the mark of Cain.\u0026nbspDoes this mean their only option is to scour the ranks of actively managed funds with ESG (environmental, social and governance) screening? Do they have to leave the cheapest, and best, route into the market for most novice and smaller investors on the shelf?\u0026nbspOne way of solving this apparent dilemma is through choosing a tracker manager prepared to vote in favour of things like climate resolutions when they’re put forward.\u0026nbspRegular readers of this column will recall that I looked at the voting behaviour of big asset managers in the last edition.

This challenge is already testing my limits but I have also found myself on an educational path.Six weeks in,\u0026nbspI have to admit that I do not have a clean shopping slate. I bought socks and thermals — but in my defence, the former were for my husband and the latter for my sister. I am not sure if they were trolling me but both (not being a party to my pledge) in particular asked me to buy these items for them.Okay, I also bought myself a vintage shirt, non-plastic food covers to replace cling film with and cotton face pads to cleanse the face without the need for additional products.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m changing my spending habits to help save the planetApart from the vintage shirt these latter purchases are also part of my new outlook on the things I consume: considering materials used in production the use they have and what happens once they become waste.From trying my best to avoid buying lunch wrapped in plastic to opting for plastic free cosmetics, I am trying to progressively reduce my waste.My phone is 20 months old and previously that would mean I would be ready to buy the new shiny phone with the improved camera. Instead I opted to renew my sim-only contract and stick with the handset I have as it’s functioning perfectly well.\u0026nbspAt the weekend I chose to replace the broken pipe for my 12-year-old vacuum cleaner rather than buy a whole new machine. I never knew that Dyson sells parts for even their older models, which came in very handy.Overall, I am changing my approach to things I own and may or may not need to buy, which is reducing my eco anxiety and saving me money.Created with Sketch.Plastic waste across the world: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A father and son on a makeshift boat made from styrofoam paddle through a garbage filled river as they collect plastic bottles that they can sell in junkshops in Manila.

This is also why I am keeping a close eye on the experience of all my fellow pledgers. How can I avoid using plastic further? Can I plan my next holiday by train travel? What local produce can I opt for instead of fruit flown in from thousands of miles away? Can I start growing my own parsley and spring onion (my parents have an annual supply of potatoes from their allotment, maybe I have learnt a thing or two from them)?Modern day consumerism (i.e. capitalism) fuels our desire to have more and more. We are somehow convinced we need all this stuff. The planet is at the desperate point where we need to convince ourselves that we actually do not.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In my 2020 quest for a more sustainable kitchen, I’ve installed a wormery in my back garden. A small move but for me a big one, as I’m still reeling from the time my brother threw a tin of worms at me when I was six years old.\u0026nbspThe worms will feed on kitchen scraps\u0026nbspbits of cabbage, banana peels, and egg shells (no oil, no dairy please) that my 2019.0 version would have tossed into the garbage. They’ll reside in a multi-level des res and churn my waste into compost. But as I feverishly read the instructions, I learn that during the first 24-hours they might ‘wander’ and head for the great outdoors. \u0026nbspI call Ronnie, co-owner of Wormcity Wormery, who calms me down. Yes, there is a potential for wander but adding a handful of our own back garden soil helps ‘welcome’ the worms to their new home. No, it’s not a problem that I’m going away for a week — they need time to get settled and overfeeding is a no-no anyway. I hang up feeling like I’ve had a session with my own worm therapist.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhy I’m promising to end all my food wasteIf you’ve got any back garden space, then a wormery is an easy way to reduce your kitchen carbon footprint. You can find them online and at garden shops and it’s an easy-to-assemble box system (more mouths  more food waste  more levels). I chose Wormcity because — aside from the fact that Ronnie doesn’t mind answering my inane questions — their wormeries are made from recycled plastic in England, so helpfully reducing travel miles.\u0026nbspMy composting worms should live for around two to three years. They’re prolific, doubling their numbers every three to four months. Even better, they’re hungry — eating up to half their body weight in food every day. That’s a lot of carrot peelings. It will take around four months for my worms to turn a tray of food scraps into compost but when they do, it will be so nutrient rich (about ten thousand times the bacteria and microbes of normal compost) that I’ll only need a small amount to use as a top dressing.\u0026nbspOf course, recycling is only part of the sustainability push. Many argue that the first rule, the mantra, if you will,\u0026nbspis to reduce. If we reduce the amount we buy in the first place, then we won’t need to recycle so much. We’ll also save money. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that an average American family of four loses $1,500 a year on uneaten food. Like many, I’ve become a BOGO junkie — buying two bottles of juice when I can only drink one at a time or splashing out on three packets of sweet potato falafel for the price of two, when I know that I’ll be pushed to finish the second, let alone the third, by the time I reach the use-by date. Every time I buy food, the clock is ticking. It might be ticking loudly, like when I buy a packet of chicken thighs, but even if I’m buying something shelf stable like rice or pasta, it’s still ticking.After my January fridge detox, I realised that the more stuff I’ve got in my fridge, the harder it is to find anything. And sadly when I do, it might be too late. During my trawl, I discovered two open bottles of fish sauce, which by anyone’s standards is one too many. I know exactly what happened — I was in a rush, opened up the fridge, did a quick look, didn’t (couldn’t) see any so opened another bottle. Shame on me.\u0026nbspNow I’m shopping with intention, as I call it. Considering my purchases more carefully and using up what I’ve got before I go crazy buying more. I rescued some Jurassic-era carrots from the veg bin but rather than throw them out, I peeled them, gave them a quick turn in salted boiling water and a refresh in cold water. The wrinkled romano pepper that looked like something out of an ad for sunscreen was sliced, seeded, roasted and then blitzed with nuts, lemon zest, olive oil, garlic and some almost-chuckable herbs. I tossed the carrots in my ersatz romesco sauce and they were delicious.\u0026nbspI discovered no less than three containers of parmesan cheese in the dark recesses of my fridge. I combined them so they’re easier to locate and will use the wedge for grating and toss the nobbly rinds into my next batch of minestrone for an umami hit. Containers heading to the freezer are labelled now, with the exception of a mystery one I missed, which I’ve decided is either chilli con carne or bolognaise. Only time and defrosting will tell.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It tells you the best place to store apples, for example, if bananas can be frozen, and how to keep quick-wilting herbs fresher longer. I liked the suggestion to turn an almost-but-not-quite-finished sauce bottle upside down (check that the lid is on tight first) so you don’t waste a drop. I’d add to that my trick to use up the last bits in a jar of mustard. Leave the mustard in the jar, add vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper and you’ve got a bottle of vinaigrette.Meanwhile, I just checked on my worms. I did a quick head (and yes, a worm does have a head) count and I don’t think they’ve wandered. They better not, they’ve got work to do.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Thought it was odd and then we walked passed it again this morning!!”The Bristol Somali Community Association hailed the mural as “remarkable”, adding: “We hope it’s Banksy’s work.”This particular mural includes the depiction of a child – seemingly, in this instance, Cupid – which many noted is similar to previous works painted by the enigmatic artist.In November, a Banksy artwork that was obscured by scaffolding\u0026nbspin Notting Hill since 2008 was uncovered.Just one month later,\u0026nbsphe created a modified Nativity scene at a hotel in\u0026nbspBethlehem.Created with Sketch.Best of Banksy Show all 68Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Banksy piece in California depicting a child wielding a machine gun, in black and white surrounded by colored flowersA rat on the clock of an old bank buildingNear the Oval BridgeThe piece, commissioned by this newspaper, is intended to represent a metaphor for the west\u0027s reluctance to tackle issues such as Aids in AfricaIn 2004, Banksy printed ‘one million pounds’ worth of his \u0027Tenners\u0027668 \u0027Love is in the Bin\u0027During Sotheby\u0027s Contemporary Art Sale on 5th October the Banksy artwork \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 shredded through the bottom of the frame as it was sold.

It\u0026nbspsaid it expects to invest more in low carbon businesses and less in oil and gas over time.\u0026nbspHowever, the company will continue to increase its production of fossil fuels over the next decade, while aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplies. That means BP\u0026nbspwill likely still have to offset hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions each year through schemes such as tree planting. BP has not provided any details about how it will achieve this.“BP is vague on the details of its plan, but it should not rely on using carbon offsetting schemes as a licence to continue polluting,” said\u0026nbspOxfam’s climate policy advisor Kiri Hanks.\u0026nbsp”Poorer countries should not be bribed to grow forests instead of food to enable business as usual in rich nations.”Murray Worthy at Global Witness, an anti-corruption and environmental campaign group, dismissed BP’s announcement.“There is nothing ambitious about a plan that is simply not credible,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0026nbspsaid it expects to invest more in low carbon businesses and less in oil and gas over time.\u0026nbspHowever, the company will continue to increase its production of fossil fuels over the next decade, while aiming to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy it supplies. That means BP\u0026nbspwill likely still have to offset hundreds of millions of tonnes of emissions each year through schemes such as tree planting. BP has not provided any details about how it will achieve this.“BP is vague on the details of its plan, but it should not rely on using carbon offsetting schemes as a licence to continue polluting,” said\u0026nbspOxfam’s climate policy advisor Kiri Hanks.\u0026nbsp”Poorer countries should not be bribed to grow forests instead of food to enable business as usual in rich nations.”Murray Worthy at Global Witness, an anti-corruption and environmental campaign group, dismissed BP’s announcement.“There is nothing ambitious about a plan that is simply not credible,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK’s largest energy supplier lost 286,000 of customer accounts last year, which is half the rate of 2018 and a quarter of the rate in 2017.British Gas has lost millions of customers to smaller suppliers and cut thousands of jobs during Mr Conn\u0027s tenure.The company also incurred hefty one-off costs in 2019, including a £476m write-down of its exploration and production business thanks to fluctuating fossil fuel prices.The energy price cap came into force at the start of last year, aiming to\u0026nbspcut outgoings for millions of households.But British Gas has been fiercely critical of how it has been implemented, winning a high court fight in November after arguing that the energy watchdog\u0027s changes to the cap\u0027s methodology were unfair.David Barclay, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Today’s results cap an undoubtedly difficult year for Centrica with drops across the board and an increase in debt.The good news, however, is that management has identified that drastic action is required and is duly taking it to make Centrica a smaller, simpler, and more competitive business. Nevertheless, there is still plenty of work to do and investors will have a keen eye on future updates.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They could be alerted to facts people were writing about them and then be provoked into joining up, he suggested.The Facebook boss was aware that the idea could be creepy and could stir up privacy concerns, he noted. But that might be assuaged with suggestions such as keeping them from appearing on search engines.It is not clear how far Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s idea did get, with Levy writing that some staff appeared to have worked on a version of it.

But, at this point in time, contributors are optimistic regarding the outlook for activity over the next 12 months.”Looking ahead, respondents to the survey expect this refreshed optimism to continue with sales anticipated to rise across all UK regions, both in the near term and for the year to come. \u0026nbspGraeme Lusk, of surveyors Walker Fraser Steele in Glasgow, said it was a good time to put a property on the market. “There is still an under supply of quality properties on the market and buyers waiting,” he said.\u0026nbspObservers fear that a long-term lack of supply combined with strong buyer interest and historically low borrowing costs will drive up the prices of homes even further out of the reach of first-time buyers.However official figures on Wednesday showed that the number of homes being both started and completed across the UK rose to their highest levels for 11 years in the 12 months to April last year. However, the 165,730 homes completed and the 202,260 started were well below the government’s target of 300,000 a year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They will be given the option of looking at their normal feed or clicking through to the latest posts, which will show in chronological order.Instagram changed the order of the feed in early 2016, almost exactly four years ago, but many of the app\u0027s users still regularly ask for it to come back.Instagram update tells users who they don’t likeIn the time since, the company has had to fight against claims that it leads to almost all posts being missed, and has made some concessions to users by changing the way the algorithm chooses which posts are chosen to be shown.Despite all of that, the company has repeatedly insisted that the chronological feed will not be returning. The new update appears to be some concession for the demands for posts to appear in time order, without entirely reversing the switch to using an algorithm.Instagram did not immediately respond to a request for comment and further information on the potential feature.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That meant the one Nintendo PlayStation became perhaps the most rare gaming object in the world.The console has a traditional disc drive, as well as slots for\u0026nbspSuper Famicom and Super Nintendo games. But there are no Nintendo PlayStation games that the buyer will actually be able to play, auctioneers say.Though the CD-ROM drive was not currently working when it was found in 2009, it has since been repaired by Benjamin Heckendorn, a YouTube personality known for his console repair videos, the listing reads. It now has the ability to play music CDs like the commercially produced PlayStation, but there is no proprietary software that\u0027s known to have been made during the prototype\u0027s development.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You were told by Remainers that this would be the consequence, but you dismissed their warnings as #ProjectFear,” she wrote in response to the tweet.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But first I had to pay a fee of £100 for it, said Mr Lala, who has lived in Britain since he was 14 and naturalised.\u0026nbspThe British national had previously gone to the UK embassy in the city to seek help, only to be told his British passport – the only one he has ever owned – was no longer valid and have it confiscated from him, leaving him stateless for weeks.100-year-old man told parents must confirm identity for settled status‘Cruelty’ as Jamaicans driven to charter flight despite court rulingHome Office charter flight to Jamaica leaves UK despite court rulingHome Office leaves modern slavery victim ‘in limbo’ for five years‘Home Office is destroying their lives’: Father-of-two to be deportedBritish man blocked from entering UK after holidayAsked as he waited for his train home whether he had been provided an explanation by the Home Office, Mr Lala told The Independent: No, I\u0027m still waiting for that.The department did not notify Mr Lala his passport had been cancelled before he left the country, instead sending a letter to an address he had never lived it. It then did not stop him leaving the country, only preventing him from getting back in when he tried to board a flight home from Brussels.The Independent contacted the UK embassy in Belgium for comment but was told they could not comment on specific cases. The Home Office has said it does not comment on specific cases, and was also approached for further comment as Mr Lala returned home.The Home Office\u0027s original state rationale for cancelling the passport was that Mr Lala\u0027s naturalisation application was made on the basis that he was born in 1986 in Serbia, but that the department believes he was born in 1985 in Albania. The department did not explain how it had come to that conclusion.Mr Lala actually missed his train home on Thursday night as his temporary travel document was subjected to intensive scrutiny.

It is appalling that he has been forced to spend three weeks stateless, stranded and homeless in Brussels due to a Home Office blunder.Over and over again, suffering is being caused by the callousness and incompetence at the Home Office.Mr Lala first arrived to the UK as a minor after being split from his family during the Serbian conflict. He went into foster care and attended school, college and university in the country, before being granted British citizenship in his early twenties.\u0026nbspAsylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier.

Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Rather than reply in the same manner, his girlfriend - who worked in the same building as an analyst on the Soviet air force - walked around to his office and accepted the proposal in person.The pair were happily married for more than 30 years, the organisation said.GCHQ targeting dyslexic and neuroerse people in recruitment driveGCHQ historian Tony Comer, who met the officer and learned of his romantic gesture, said: “He was the shy and retiring type and never quite found the right moment to ask her face to face.“So he drew on the GCHQ tradition of finding ingenious solutions to the toughest of problems to pop the question.“They married, and lived happily ever after, and all thanks to the aid of a Lamson tube.“We\u0027ve always prided ourselves on our ability to think outside the box.”GCHQ, which rarely speaks publicly about its work but has tried to become less secretive in recent years, decided to reveal the heart-warming story to mark Valentine\u0027s Day.The identities of the couple have been kept secret because of their work and the contents of the letter remain private.The secret GCHQ spy base between the pub and StarbucksBritish spy network runs all-female classes to recruit women hackersAfter being set up on 1 November 1919 as a peacetime “cryptanalytic” unit made up from staff from the Admiralty\u0027s Room 40 and the War Office\u0027s MI1(b), GCHQ moved to Bletchley Park during the Second World War to decrypt German messages, most famously by breaking the Enigma code.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Otherwise, the most well-known candidates will have an unfair advantage.“I hope every candidate for leader and deputy will agree – as well as their supporters. This needs to be a fair contest, and delaying the start of the ballot will ensure its integrity.”Ms Allin-Khan pointed out that candidates were being asked to pay £5,000 each to tap into the membership lists and contact the race’s voters themselves.Created with Sketch.Who could replace Corbyn as Labour leader?

The chemicals are supposed to be “taken to a suitable and authorised waste disposal site”, according to a spokesperson for Clariant, one of the world\u0027s leading speciality chemical companies.“Under no circumstances should these empty containers be used by people for any reason, in particular for holding drinking water,” said Rick Steiner, an oil pollution adviser in Alaska who consults for governments, aid groups and the United Nations on oil spills.Soil and water samples from the area, and biological samples from soldiers who had been stationed there were analysed at the National Health Laboratory Service in South Africa. They found mercury levels in the water were seven times what is permissible under US\u0026nbspEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, and manganese concentrations were 10 times higher than the EPA allows, according to a summary of the study obtained by the Associated Press. The chemicals were also found in the soil and in urine samples from some of the soldiers.“These results are clearly indicating that heavy metals and petrochemicals have contaminated the area,” the summary stated, and it recommended more studies to see if the pollution is connected with the health problems.The most recent study, from November 2018, was commissioned by Dar Petroleum to assess the chemical contamination in its oil fields and the surrounding areas.Researchers documented\u0026nbsphundreds of waste pits filled with water contaminated with arsenic and lead. They also found extremely high levels of hydrocarbons such as benzene in the soil.The report recommended a five-year clean-up that would cost about $58m\u0026nbsp(£44m). South Sudan expects its oil industry to generate $99m\u0026nbsp(£76m)\u0026nbspin revenue each month from July 2019 to June 2020, according to the national budget.South Sudan\u0027s president Salva Kiir acknowledged in a statement in January that there is a pollution problem in the oilfields and surrounding areas, and said he wants to bring proper environmental standards to the country\u0027s oil exploration operations.The government in January asked for proposals from companies to perform an “environmental audit” that will evaluate how to clean up the existing pollution and put in place best practices for future oil exploration.Residents, however, are sceptical, saying the government and oil companies have talked about cleaning up the pollution before.​In February, Phillips Anyang Ngong, a human rights lawyer, sued South Sudan\u0027s Ministry of Petroleum, Greater Pioneer Operating Company and Nile Petroleum - the country\u0027s state owned oil company, claiming the oil pollution caused health problems and loss of life and demanding $500m\u0026nbsp(£380m) for victims. It\u0027s the first human rights lawsuit due to oil pollution filed in the country, he said.“Companies are violating the law and the government is not intervening,” he said. “It\u0027s a crisis that needs immediate attention now.”But the government doesn\u0027t appear to be in a hurry.South Sudan\u0027s petroleum minister, Awow Daniel Chuang, said until there\u0027s scientific evidence tying health problems to oil pollution, no conclusions should be drawn.“Only speculations are being made until scientific evidences are out to see the level of damages created by oil operations. Obviously there shouldn\u0027t be conclusions with evidences connected to deformation,” he said.Health experts with experience\u0026nbsptackling oil pollution say companies often try to hide any connection between pollution and health problems.The biggest-polluting brands need to change their business models“Polluters try as much as possible not to let connections be drawn from pollution to health issues, they try to connect it to something else, like genetics. This is a known tactic,” said Nnimmo Bassey, executive director for health at the Health of Mother Earth Foundation, a not-for-profit environmental group based in Nigeria.Environmental experts say there is little incentive for multinational companies to do anything because it is easy to get away with things in impoverished countries like South Sudan.That\u0027s in part because the country is so dependent upon its oil sector to survive.Oil accounts for almost all the country\u0027s exports and more than 40 per cent of its GDP, according to the World Bank. As South Sudan emerges after years of civil war, it is trying to revive its economy by expanding the industry. Last October, the ministry of petroleum announced plans to open 14 oil blocks this year for exploration.“No one\u0027s really watching. The government is neither willing nor able to monitor and enforce its own environmental laws,” said Luke Patey, senior researcher studying China\u0027s oil investments in Africa at the Danish Institute for International Studies.He said the result is “a vicious cycle of negligence”.Additional reporting by the Associated PressShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

His comments come\u0026nbspdays after a former Goldman Sachs chief executive,\u0026nbspLloyd Blankfein, said on Twitter that Sanders would “ruin our economy.”In an interview with Bloomberg,\u0026nbspPiketty cited\u0026nbspSweden as an example. At the start of the 20th century, Sweden — now held up as an egalitarian country — was entirely controlled by wealthy elites and voting rights were determined by property. Within a very short space of time, and with little economic disruption, it became the\u0026nbspsocial democratic nation that we now know.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis precedent\u0026nbspbodes well for Mr Sanders\u0027 policy goals of reforming\u0026nbspAmerican capitalism, Piketty suggested.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Internally displaced children stand on snow near tents at a makeshift camp in Azaz, SyriaA model presents a creation from the Marc Jacobs FallWinter 2020 collection during New York Fashion WeekHawaiian surfer Kai Lenny rides a wave during the big waves Nazare Tow Surfing Challenge in NazareA worker wears a protective suit as he stands outside an office building while checking people entering  in Beijing, China.

Especially with inflation at only . per cent. But no.They’ve voted themselves an inflation-busting . per cent instead — so they’ll now get £ just for showing up.A few Lords and Ladies have experience and ability, we admit. The rest shuffle in for the warmth and the cash.The truth is the House of Lords is an antiquated insult to our democracy, a dumping ground for political failures and discredited cronies, where almost no one is too odious . . . though it still draws the line at Bercow, obviously.A courageous Government with a big majority would take it on and reinvent it as a mainly elected second chamber — with a small handful of unelected peers chosen for specic expertise.How about it, Boris THE decision on whether to proceed with the HS high-speed rail project was bound to upset plenty of people whichever way it went.So perhaps it is no surprise that Boris Johnson has tried to appease both its supporters and opponents by pressing ahead with the bulk of the £billion project, while putting two of its northern spurs on pause.But the PM is shrewd enough to realise that the places losing out — Crewe to Manchester and the West Midlands to Leeds — are the very areas that he must keep on sidehis -seat majority is not to be a one-off.Boris’s alternative transport plans for them, with improved bus and cycle links just a start, must not let them down.Otherwise the snub could see Labour rebuild its “red wall” of voters as quickly as he demolished it.THE Cabinet reshuffle this week must be bold. It will define Boris’s premiership.There are obviously talented contenders for bigger jobs: among them Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Victoria Atkins.But this is not the moment for the PM to reward other time-servers whose turn has come. Boris must not overlook fresh faces from the  and  intakes and, while it is probably too early for December’s newcomers, why not,they have the talent This Government already has a place in history simply by forcing Brexit through on January .With dynamic, imaginative, bright and brave ministers it can be truly radical too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No mention of economics.So what knowledge, pray tell, could he possibly impart to a room full of high-flyers connected to Wall Street banking giant JP Morgan, particularly when the rumoured fee was million Well, after a brief speech by his we Meghan at the “Alternative Investment Summit” in Miami, Harry was brought on stage as the headline act and, once again, dug deep to mine the deeply painful memory of his mother’s death.Fair enough when he’s using his experience to highlight the work of a mental health charity and help others.But is it really a suitable subject for a big-bucks event where he’s simply being wheeled out like the latest must-see arrival at a freak show As the new royal escapee on the block, his kudos is currently high.But in the law of ever diminishing s, how long before the American big-hitters tire of his well-trodden trope about “one’s mental health” and move on to the next big thing Not long, I’d wager.Then, Harry and Meghan will really start to feel the bite of their brave new world of “financial independence” and that’s when they will become more of a potential liability for The Queen than they already are.As part of the Royal Family, Harry was largely protected from the potential pitfalls of mingling with unvetted people whose activities might later jump up and bite him.Though, admittedly, it didn’t stop Prince Andrew from getting bogged down in the swamp of Jeffrey Epstein’s questionable lestyle.But outside of The Firm The risks are even greater and, given Harry’s obvious naivety and his we’s towering ambition to be a change-maker, they are sitting ducks for any unscrupulous wolves in sheep’s clothing.This appearance at a corporate shindig shouts loud and clear that they are now “royals for sale”.But ultimately, the cost to the reputation of the monarchy could be irreparable.MARGOT ROBBIE’S husband Tom Ackerley was caught casting a wary eye as she enjoyed a hug with her former co-star Leonardo DiCaprio on the Oscars red carpet.He shouldn’t worry.At , she’s far too old for him.JONTY BRAVERY is “scarily intelligent” and built like a rugby player.He is also mentally ill and currently awaiting sentencing for throwing a six-year-old boy over a ft drop at London’s Tate Modern art gallery.He is being detained at a top security hospital, but before the incident he lived in a flat in West London where a team of six carers worked around the clock to make sure he was never left alone.One of them told a court he was, “one of the most challenging mental patients I’ve ever encountered”, ­particularly given his size, aggression and relentless determination to try to escape from them.As we know, something went terribly wrong on the day he was able to grab the poor boy, who is still in hospital.But it doesn’t detract from the fact that whatever his carers are paid to deal   with such a powerful, high-octane charge, it isn’t enough.I couldn’t wouldn’t do it.How about you A COURT has rejected jihadi bride Shamima Begum’s bid to win back her British citizenship.Judges at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission concluded that, despite being  when she ran away to join IS in Syria, it was her own choice and she is no longer Britain’s responsibility.Whatever your view of Ms Begum’s plightthis decision is surely the right one in hopefully serving as a deterrent to any other young people who might be thinking of doing the same.WHILE Hollywood’s glitterati were enjoying the post-Oscars parties, spare a thought for poor Emily Ratajkowski, who was woken in the early hours by a fire alarm at her hotel.As you can see, she was forced to leave her room with only a couple of towels to protect her modesty.What  Oh, apparently this is the dress she wore to the Oscars.Sorry about that.Yep. The same Boris Johnson — now PM — whose senior aides have just tried to ban certain journalists from an official government briefing.Go figure.VISITORS to the ancient, and usually peaceful, site of Glastonbury Tor have complained that their peace is being shattered by a “selfish” busker and his persistent bongo playing.I sympathise. Le’s precious silences are a rarity these days and the preoccupation with having music as a backdrop in everything from restaurants to toilets drives me to distraction. Particularly when most of it isn’t even good.Years ago, we had secured a wonderful people-watching seat in a Parisian cafe when an accordion player suddenly appeared on the pavement nearby.We endured a couple of songs but when it became clear he wasn’t moving, The Bloke asked how much he earned a night and was told: “About  euros.”Pressing a note into his hand, he said: “Here’s the same to p*** off to another location.”Which he duly did.So perhaps the Somerset bongo player is wilfully angling for a similar outcome.LAST year I applied for “veried fan status”, set my alarm and, after several nail-biting minutes, managed to secure two vastly expensive tickets to see Madonna’s Madame X show at the London Palladium for February , .Then, a couple of weeks ago, Her ­Madgeness announced that, owing to injury, she would be cancelling two shows of her -night run – and guess what . . .  Amazing how you can go off someone.TURNS out that the American woman who killed British teenager Harry Dunn by driving on the wrong side of the road is a former CIA spy.So what We already know she’s called Anne Sacoolas, we know where she lives in the US and we’ve even seen photos of her filling her car with petrol.So it’s not asany secret cover would be blown by her ing to Britain to answer accident-related questions in a British court.It changes nothing.“WE should be talking about what politicians do, rather than what they’re wearing,” says Shadow Culture Secretary Tracy Brabin piously after the online furore surrounding her outfit choice while addressing the Commons.In that case, best not wear an off-the-shoulder number better suited to a disco.SKY Sports presenter Jacquie Beltrao tweeted a photo of her -year-old son’s messy bedroom with a shout out of: “Can anyone compete with that ”Yep.We’ve had three Olympic-standard mess-pots in our house and one is still in residence.The rules have always been that no food is to be left lying around.Everything   I consider it their space, their problem and, most importantly, something I can simply close the door on and pretend it doesn’t exist.My daughters’ maths tests were beyond my capability by Year . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Long after I’ve been buried. The thrill of seeing Nuneaton go by in a blur will remain only a dream for me.Yes, HS is going ahead.A rail service that was designed to ­benefit the north of England. But will probably benefit Londoners primarily. Same ol’ same ol’ then. I’ve always had mixed feelings about HS. I don’t really care that it’s horribly over budget.Everything we do is ALWAYS horribly over budget. And takes twice as long as we were told it would take. If this were China or Russia, the thing would have been finished last week. .But I do care that this line is ripping up more of England’s green and pleasant land. We have been rapidly paving over our country in the past  years.It is true, mind, that once a big rail line is built and people get to travel on it, many of the complaints dissolve. As the Government says, this was true of the HS line, which faced enormous opposition at the outset. Now everyone seems to be agreed that it’s a brilliant thing.Sure. But HS was dferent. There were parts of Kent where it took almost two hours to reach central London by train. That’s been cut massively — to  minutes from Ashford International.That’s a real change for the better.The problem with HS is that it doesn’t sort out the problems that need sorting out. And those are the problems in the north of our country.Leeds and Manchester, for example, are only -odd miles apart. And yet the train service between these two great northern cities is woeful.The North East is stuck out on a limb, with truly rotten local services and long journey times between cities.Take my neck of the woods, Teesside — a vast area of , people. Two hours almost to travel the  miles to Leeds. More than an hour — sometimes one hour  minutes — to reach Newcastle,  miles away.No wonder people use their cars, instead. And the first stage of HS won’t come near to sorting that out.The people in the North who dutully marched over to vote for the Tories last December know that HS is not really for them.They need new lines and new infrastructure to link up the big cities and the new hi-tech industrial hubs — Merseyside, Manchester, Leeds, Teesside and Tyneside. That will take considerable investment.The money spent on HS could have more usefully been erted to new, speedy, rail links between our northern cities.Don’t think that we, up here, don’t know. We’re not stupid. We voted Conservative for a whole bunch of reasons — but those votes were only loaned. They are not for the Tories in perpetuity.Unless we get that kind of investment, Boris, you might find that Red Wall being built again.IT seems that Chinese people in London are getting sick of being abused on account of the coronavirus.People shouting at them stuff like: “We’d all be OKyou lot didn’t eat dead bats!” And so on.The same thing is happening in Paris. One poor Asian bloke was walking around with a placard that read: “I am NOT a virus.”I think we need to reach out with a bit of affection. If you see a Chinese bloke on the Tube give him a big hug. Unless he’s coughing a lot.THE Prime Minister’s chief adviser, the excellent Dominic Cummings, has suggested that the cabinet be replaced by the kids’ cartoon characters, PJ Masks.For once, he is wrong. I can see the attraction, obviously. But I thinkyou wanted a really dynamic cabinet, Wonder Pets! are the way to go.And Ming-Ming Duckling should be Chancellor of the Exchequer.PRINCE Harry,he’s still a Prince, was flown by private jet to give a speech to one of the richest companies in the world, JP Morgan.He won’t tell ushe was paid for it or not. He’s now supposedly on the verge of a deal with investment bank Goldman Sachs. They made plenty of money out of the banking crisis in , which saw ordinary people properly stuffed.He talks like a leftie and acts like the most venal, money-grabbing capitalist. And all the while being ferried to and from in the most environmentally unfriendly manner possible.Anyway,you’ve got time to spare, watch a -second video clip of US comic Kyle Dunnigan pretending to be Meghan Markle. It’s the funniest thing I’ve seen for years.APPARENTLY we human beings spend , hours of our miserably short lives regretting stuff we’ve done in the past. And mulling it over.That’s almost a year spent tearing your hair out. About whether it was right to have done your we’s sister when the missus was away on a work trip.And I bet it’s only people guilty of little misdemeanours who fret the most.I can’t know for sure, but I would guess that Hitler didn’t spend , hours thinking: “Hmmm. I wonderit was right to have invaded Poland ”I suppose we eat ourselves up with worry because it might stop us doing the same thing again. But it doesn’t, does it SO the we tells me in no uncertain terms to buy no presents for Valentine’s Day. Fair enough, I think. whole thing’s a con.Then, two days ago, she askedI’ve ordered her Valentine’s Day flowers yet.I’m like, “Whaaaa ” It transpires that flowers are not “presents”.Dunno what other gt she was expecting. Better get a card, too, I suppose.The ones that sell best are those with really filthy messages. So I’ve decided to make my own.The verse will read: “Roses are redAnd Margate’s in ThanetI’ve got a todgerThe size of a planet.”Hope she likes it.I’M really enjoying Dominic Sandbrook’s history of the s on BBC.I can’t say I liked the decade much at the time. The music was crap, for a start, and so were the hairstyles. Sandbrook brings it all back to le.That strange time before everyone was online all day and night and when mobile phones were the size of a shed door.It will be remembered as an age when the Tories had a huge majority, Labour was utterly unelectable and rich people in the city made more and more money.

Throw that gut feeling right out the window.”Invoking the location of the rape trial in Manhattan Supreme Court, Rotunno asked the members of the jury to use their “New York City common sense”.Rotunno aimed to cast doubt on the testimony of Weinstein’s accusers, particularly Miriam Haley and Jessica Mann, painting them as unreliable. She argued prosecutors as invented an “alternative universe” in which Weinstein was portrayed as an overweight monster … so unattractive and large that no woman would want to sleep with him voluntarily.”Rotunno, a self-described ‘Me Too’ movement skeptic, said the encounters between Weinstein and the women making accusations against him did not count as rape or sexual abuse, because, she claimed, they could have removed themselves from the situation.“[According to the prosecution] women are not responsible for the parties they attend, the men they flirt with, the choices they made to further their own careers.”She compared prosecutors to “producers” who were writing a “script.”Charges made against Weinstein in the case include raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in , and holding another woman down and forcing oral sex on her in .

They employ more people than large companies and are responsible for  per cent of recent job creation.”The eldest of three children, Sunak studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.He went on to work at investment bank Goldman Sachs before setting up hedge fund Theleme Partners  years ago.In  he stood for election in Richmond, North Yorks, after the constituency’s previous MP, former Tory leader William Hague, retired.It was the safest Conservative seat in the country and his victory was assured.Former Brexit minister David Jones MP told The Sun: “He is very bright. There was no doubt from the start that he was destined for high office.”After being elected, Sunak moved to a -acre property with its own lake and boathouse in an idyllic small village near Northallerton.It was there he has held lavish summer parties, with champagne and canapes served by unormed staff.Though he earned several million from his investment fund, much of his huge wealth comes through we Akshata’s family.She is the daughter of self-made Indian tech billionaire N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of firm Infosys.Akshata, whose shares in the company are worth around £million, also runs a fashion label.The couple married in  and have two daughters, Krishna and Anoushka.Former PM Theresa May made Sunak a housing under-secretary in January .Her successor Boris promoted him to Chief Secretary to the Treasury last July.William Hague described Sunak as “exceptional”, and ex-Chancellor Sajid Javid once tweeted: “The force is strong with young Sunak.”Now Sunak has taken Javid’s job, which is good news for Brexit-supporting Tories, because while Javid backed Remain during the referendum, Sunak was always a Leaver.Clwyd West MP David Jones, who was on the advisory board of pressure group Leave Means Leave, said: “Boris recognises that there is going to be tough negotiation with the EU.“He realises he’s going to need the Treasury behind him in that.“The Prime Minister now has a strong ally in the Treasury.”Sunak backed Brexit as he felt excessive EU regulations were shackling the nation’s small businesses.He said: “EU red tape is holding them back.“From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future.”Sunak, whose grandparents were born in India and emigrated to Britain in the s, also felt it was wrong to give EU citizens easy access to the UK when it was often denied to nationalities outside of the Brussels bloc.Describing himself as a British Indian whose hobbies include “keeping fit, cricket, football and movies”, he said: “I come from a family of immigrants. I am grateful to Britain for giving my family the opportunity to settle here and forge a better le.“I am proud of our country’s generous approach to welcoming hardworking and ambitious immigrants and believe it is in our interests to continue doing so.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those who claim otherwise are risking people’s lives.Our Vaccine Strategy will soon be published outlining how we will increase uptake, limit the spread of vaccine misinformation and ensure every child receives two doses of their MMR vaccination.Anyone who is unsure whether they are fully covered should contact their GP.Mumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine.Mumps is most recognisable by the painful swellings in the side of the face under the ears , giving a person with mumps a distinctive hamster face appearance.Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain and a high temperature, which may develop a few days before the swelling of the parotid glands.While mumps is not usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis.Your GP can usually make a diagnosis after seeing and feeling the swelling, looking at the position of the tonsils in the mouth and checking the persons temperature to seeits higher than normal.Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu: through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards.During this time, its important to prevent the infection spreading to others, particularly teenagers and young adults who have not been vaccinated.If you have mumps, you can help prevent it spreading by:Source: NHSMumps is a viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine.It is most recognisable by the painful swelling of the glands at the side of the face, giving a person with mumps a distinctive hamster face appearance.Other symptoms include headaches, joint pain and fever, which may develop a few days before the swelling.If you suspect that you or a family member has mumps, contact your GP.Vaccination is the safest and most effective way to protect yourself from mumps.It prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and evena vaccinated person does get mumps, they will likely have less severe illness than an unvaccinated person.Dr Vanessa Saliba, Consultant Epidemiologist at Public Health England, said: The best protection against mumps and its complications is to have two doses of the MMR vaccine.

I don’t believe any self-respecting minister would accept such conditions. Therefore I felt the best thing to do was to go.”In his resignation letter, Mr Javid appeared to take a shot at the PM by accusing him of undermining the Treasurys credibility by surrounding himself with Yes men advisors.He said: It is crucial for the effectiveness of government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice.Mr Javid also wrote: I would urge you to ensure the Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible.The bombshell decision to resign comes amid an ongoing feud with the PMs chief adviser Dominic Cummings.It culminated in the mandarin launching a surprise power-grab for the Treasury leaving the Chancellors tenure in tatters.Their fallout was sparked when the spin chief unceremoniously sacked a member of Javids senior staff over an explosive leaking row last summer.This morning Mr Cummings refused to answer questions about the spat."},{"url":null,"title":"storm dennis live uk met office weather","story":"The Met Office has issued four danger to le weather warnings as Storm Dennis hurtles towards Britain.Follow our Storm Dennis live blog for all the latest updates. After Storm Ciara wreaked havoc across the UK earlier this week, widespread flooding caused serious damage to some local sports clubs.Tadcaster Albions pitches and facilities suffered from severe flooding which chairman Andy Charlesworth believes could cost upwards of £, to fix.The North Yorkshire Football Club could face another onslaught of heavy rain with the arrival of Storm Dennis this weekend.Corby Town Rugby Club in Northamptonshire also had its clubhouse destroyed by the weather.

Speaking outside his home in London he said: “I don’t believe any self-respecting minister would accept such conditions so therefore I felt the best thing to do was to go”, he said in a jibe at his successor. But today Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he didnapost believe the public cared about whether or not ministers abandoned their staff. He told the BBC: I think what matters to the public is not who the advisers are or how the Government structures them, but what we are trying to achieve. There is a lot we want to get done. This is an incredibly important year for the country.We left the EU in January, we want to ensure the Budget is a very strong one that really begins to deliver on what we promised in that general election.The Prime Minister is very much in charge. He chooses the top team and how they are structured. We in Government are completely focused on getting things done, delivering on the priorities of the public - not on special advisers or how Government is run internally. Askedhe would stand by his staff, Mr Jenrick refused to answer saying: I wasnapost put in that position of course I have a fantastic team around me. In contrast itaposs understood that Justice Secretary Robert Buckland was asked to sack his aide to keep his job and did so.  Mr Javid - the most high profile person to leave the government - was replaced by his deputy Rishi Sunak. He said it had been a huge honour to serve as chancellor, one of the four great offices of state. But he refused to give in to the conditions imposed by Boris Johnsonaposs senior adviser Dominic Cummings. When asked whether the conditions were put forward by Mr Cummings, he said they were imposed by the Prime Minister. He added: My successor has my full support as does the Prime Minister.In the resignation he sent to Boris Johnson, Javid urged the PM to ensure he Treasury as an institution retains as much credibility as possible.He repeated his explanation that he could no accept the conditions attached to the reappointment.  In a pointed remark he said: It is crucial for the effectiveness of government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice, as I have always sought to do. I also believe that it is important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you would wish to be associated with. He urged the PM to not to waste a moment in delivering on the promise made in the election to lead us forward into a decade of social and economic renewal.

Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings have purged the frontbench of dissenting voices, replacing them with poodles and proxies. The Prime Minister has used the shake-up to tighten Downing Street’s control. Promotions have not been made on merit but on who is more likely to do No’s bidding. Competent ministers such as Julian Smith, who oversaw theof power sharing as Northern Ireland Secretary, have been sacked. Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor rather than submit to Downing Street’s demands. Johnson is only interested in accumulating as much power as possible and removing anybody who seeks to hold him in check. We have seen this regime try to muzzle political reporters and intimidate the BBC. The next chapter in this war on dissent will attempt to neuter the power of the courts. The reshuffle will lead to worse government by an administration that resents being held to account.

I couldnapost have been prouder of her as a mother, she was beautul. She was the most loving and caring person, she would have been so unhappy to know what she had done to us. Katrinaaposs mother told the court repeatedly that her daughter had aposmildapos mental health problems and had shown no indication of self harm or suicide. The inquest heard her daughter had apossome anxietyapos and had been feeling down in the past few months but had told the doctor that she had a good support network and was keen to deal with the issues through exercise and healthy eating. Her mother also mentioned a aposcry for helpapos from back in  when Katrina was in Australia but claims that this was not part of a long term mental health problem. Mrs Allen said: She sometimes felt a bit down, but would pick herself back up. She did go to the doctors two weeks before, that was encouraged by me. She spoke to the doctor and her boyfriend, she said she would sort it out herself with a good diet and exercise. She was the happiest she had been for a long time. There were no signicant issues we could think of at all.Mrs Allen told the court that her daughter had been open about her drug taking in the past but was not aware of how often or how much her daughter was consuming cocaine. Katie Mary Jackson, who spoke at the inquest, confirmed that Katrina had taken cocaine but claimed that there had been no arguments within the group and that Katrina was in a good mood. She said: Kat was fine, she was the happiest Iaposve seen her in a long time. It was an all round happy night, we were having deep conversation with our friends.  But Jay Nelson, who also spoke at the court, confirmed that Katrina had freaked out at around .am and had to be calmed down before she left the flat. She later called a taxi and asked him to drop her at Waddington bridge where she exited and made her way to a nearby wooded area near the riverbank. She was found by a dog walker at around .am and airlted to Blackburn hospital. Katrina was pronounced dead at .am. Assistant coroner Mark Williams concluded that Katrina had taken her own le.  There is only one conclusion can take come to, he told Katrinaaposs family. That is that Katrina took her own le, I donapost see it as a cry for help because it was done in a remote location where no one was likely to find her. Toxicology reports confirmed that Katrina had taken cocaine and alcohol before she died.

Floral tributes including a bottle of Jack Daniels and a Rolex watch have been left to remember Billy and Joe Smith found dead just days after Christmas. Billy and Joe, who appeared on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding in , were found dead in a country lane in a suspected double suicide. A grieving woman held the glass of Billy’s carriage and kissed the window before saying “I love you” outside St John’s Church. There was an outpouring of tributes following their tragic deaths and their funeral is underway in Sevenoaks, Kent. As the service was about to start at .am, there was standing room only. A small boy in a grey suit was comforted by the side of Billy’s carriage where women gathered smoking cigarettes and pressing their hands against the carriage. The twins’ white coffins were carried into the church, one behind the other.The street emptied as the service begun, leaving a trio of white Mercedes limos parked outside. A heartbreaking poem, written by the twinsapos best friends, was read out at the service. To the boys from your closest friends, Words will never be able to convey The emptiness we feel today. Remember all the precious moments From near misses on camp fires When fishing through the night, To venue nights with your cousin, Angel, and Roxie Where we laughed so much we cried. That’s the way it was, just us five. And then there would be the outings to McD’s, Asking for a roast dinner, your face dead straight While the rest of us could barely keep a straight face. There has never been a time we felt sadness As your energy and light would light any room. Your love and laughter left footprints on our hearts When you left you took a piece of all of us with you. Till we meet again, rest in paradise, boys.  Some of the outstanding floral arrangements at the home of their doting gran Phoebe Smith include a bottle of Jack Daniels made entirely out of flowers, a Rolex watch and a poignant display of the word apossonsapos. Among the tributes are huge freestanding love hearts, and frames of the boys with their loved ones, including their beloved grandma, Phoebe Smith. Those looking at the flowers in Ms Smithaposs front garden are also hearing a selection of the twinsapos favourite songs on a speaker. Fittingly on Valentineaposs Day, dozens of Ferrero Rocher chocolates filled a heart of roses.  A picture of the twins, both , made up the letter aposOapos in the word aposSonsapos. One note on the Jack Danielaposs floral tribute said:To my pals Bill and Joe. Gone but never forgotten. Always in our thoughts. Another note on a similar Jose Cuervo Especial tequila bottle floral tribute read: To my Joe and Billy. Thank you for the best memories and never leaving me. Iaposll love you forever. One tribute said: To Kentaposs biggest two legends. I will miss you both very much. Until we meet again boys. Today hundreds of people are lining the streets of Sevenoaks in Kent before the funeral service at .am. A reporter for Kent Live who is in Sevenoaks said: The majority of people are in pockets of small groups chatting away, catching up and introducing each other to those they haven’t met or seen in a while. It’s pretty cold but some of the men have been passing around little bottles of JD, one of the twins’ favourite drinks, to warm the spirits and pay their respects.  Starting at their grandmotheraposs house at about am, the route is taking mourners along High Street towards St John the Baptist Church - a journey of nearly two miles. The white carriages are adorned with flowers and pictures of the boys. Joey, who was born first, was in the first carriage while Billy followed behind in the second carriage. The carriage carrying Joey had the word Daddy spelt out in white flowers on its roof while Billy had Uncle on top of his.Pictures of the twins were displayed on each side of the carriages, which were being driven by people dressed all in black, to show family and friends who was in each one. They were followed by three white Mercedes limos, thought to contain some of the boysapos closest family members. They were tragically found next to each other in a country lane on the morning of December   after a relative found a suicide note, a coroner was told.  The tree surgeons, who had celebrated their nd birthdays about two weeks earlier, were remembered on a Facebook memorial page as brothers who came into this world together and went into the next together. Paddy Doherty, one of the reality showaposs biggest names and winner of CelebrityBig Brother, said in a video tribute that the deaths of the two good-looking boys were a terrible tragedy. Other tributes on the memorial page said it was just heartbreaking two beautul young souls gone too soon and wished the pair would both rest in gods home in heaven in eternal peace.

"},{"url":null,"title":"happy valentines day history st","story":"w.mantis  Happy Valentines Day! History of St Valentine and the most romantic day of the yearValentines Day is celebrated by millions of people every year who want to show their love for thier other half. However the story behind Saint Valentine is not so romanticThe most romantic day of the year is here when you can show your other half just how much you love them.  nValentine’s Day can be a love it or loathe it day. While some celebrate with romantic gestures, cards and flowers others stay well clear of all such displays.  nBut what is the story behind Valentine’s Day   nWell as it’s February  here’s everything you need to know about the history of the day and how we’ve ended up where we are.  nWe’ve gone through the history books to find out the reasons and origins and how the dayaposs evolved.  nThe true history behind St Valentine  nNumerous Christian saints go by the name of Valentine.  nThe one that’s become the centre of attention every February  is St Valentine of Rome.  nTwo legends surround him.  nThe first is that men in the Roman army had been forbidden to marry by Emperor Claudius II as he believed married men did not make good soldiers.  nThis was something Valentine disagreed with and he set about performing secret weddings for Christian soldiers until his actions were uncovered, leading to his arrest and execution in  AD.  n  n   nThe other suggests that his arrest was for helping persecuted Christians escape prison in Rome.  nAfter being thrown into jail himself he fell in love with a young woman - who is believed to be the jailer’s daughter - who visited him in his cell.  nHis final letter to this woman, which he left on the day of his execution, was signed ‘From your Valentine’.  nConfusion remains around the identity of St Valentine. Other accounts suggest there was a Valentine who was Bishop of Terni who also died at the hands of Claudius II, however it’s thought these two men are the same.  nThe church stopped veneration of Valentine in , however he is still listed as an official saint.  n Best Valentineaposs Day quotes to write in a Valentineaposs Day card n Instagram Valentineaposs Day filters to help you spread the love tomorrow   nThe name “Valentinus” comes from the Latin word for worthy, strong or powerful which became popular between the second and eighth centuries.  nAs a result there are around a dozen St Valentines and even a Pope Valentine. February  though celebrates St Valentine of Rome who is patron saint of beekeepers and epilepsy.  nHe’s also patron saint for fainting, the plague and travelling as well as engaged couples and happy marriages as people - both single and in relationships - call on his help every February.  nWhen did Valentine’s Day start   nThe origins of what is now Valentine’s Day date back to a Roman Festival known as Lupercalia, according to History.  nHeld on February , it was a fertility festival dedicated to the Roman God of Agriculture, Faunus, in which boys would draw girls’ names from a box. The subsequent pair would be partners for the festival with these matches often leading to marriage later on.  nIt was outlawed at the end of the th century when Pope Gelasius I established Saint Valentine’s Day in  AD which started off as a Christian feast. Links to love didn’t come until much later.  nThe first time the Valentine’s Day feast is believed to have been associated with love is Geoffrey Chaucer’s  poem ‘Parliament of Foules’. In it he described February  as the day birds found their mate: “For this was sent on Seynt Valentyne’s day   Whan every foul cometh ther to choose his mate.”  nThere’s no actual record of Valentine’s Day before this poem.  nSt Valentine’s remains  nThe skull of St Valentine is still in Rome and is now on display in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin where it’s adorned with flowers. But it’s not always been there.  nIt was found when a catacomb near Rome was being excavated in the early th century when skeletal remains and other relics now associated with the saint were dug up.  nAs is the norm for these types of finds they were then split and distributed soyou want to see other remains of St Valentine then you can in England, Scotland, Ireland, France and the Czech Republic.  nWhen did Valentine’s Day become commercial   n  n   nInterest in Valentine’s Day started to climb in the early s when huge amounts of printed cars were sold.  nBut it was in  when Hallmark Cards in Kansas City began mass producing dedicated Valentine’s Day cards that interest really took off. That, coupled with the arrival of the postage stamp, led to the start of people sending them anonymously with racy messages and poems often written inside.  nThese days  million Valentine’s Day cards are sent annually in the UK with the USA sending more than  million.  nThe act of signing them anonymously - as well as avoiding potential embarrassment - was started by the Victorians who thought it was bad luck to sign the cards with their actual names.  nWhy are roses associated with Valentine’s Day   nEver since the early s when Charles II of Sweden brought the Persion poetical art known as “language of flowers” to Europe, roses have symbolised love.  nThe red rose was also believed to be the favourite flower of Venus, the Roman Goddess of Love, reinforcing the flower’s role in Valentine’s Day.  nMeanwhile Cupid is the God of Desire, Erotic Love and Attraction.

However the story behind Saint Valentine is not so romantic nThe most romantic day of the year is here when you can show your other half just how much you love them. nValentine’s Day can be a love it or loathe it day. While some celebrate with romantic gestures, cards and flowers others stay well clear of all such displays. nBut what is the story behind Valentine’s Day  nWell as it’s February  here’s everything you need to know about the history of the day and how we’ve ended up where we are. nWe’ve gone through the history books to find out the reasons and origins and how the days evolved. nNumerous Christian saints go by the name of Valentine. nThe one that’s become the centre of attention every February  is St Valentine of Rome. nTwo legends surround him. nThe first is that men in the Roman army had been forbidden to marry by Emperor Claudius II as he believed married men did not make good soldiers. nThis was something Valentine disagreed with and he set about performing secret weddings for Christian soldiers until his actions were uncovered, leading to his arrest and execution in  AD. nThe other suggests that his arrest was for helping persecuted Christians escape prison in Rome. nAfter being thrown into jail himself he fell in love with a young woman - who is believed to be the jailer’s daughter - who visited him in his cell. nHis final letter to this woman, which he left on the day of his execution, was signed ‘From your Valentine’. nConfusion remains around the identity of St Valentine. Other accounts suggest there was a Valentine who was Bishop of Terni who also died at the hands of Claudius II, however it’s thought these two men are the same. nThe church stopped veneration of Valentine in , however he is still listed as an official saint. n Best Valentines Day quotes to write in a Valentines Day card  n Instagram Valentines Day filters to help you spread the love tomorrow  nThe name “Valentinus” comes from the Latin word for worthy, strong or powerful which became popular between the second and eighth centuries. nAs a result there are around a dozen St Valentines and even a Pope Valentine. February  though celebrates St Valentine of Rome who is patron saint of beekeepers and epilepsy. nHe’s also patron saint for fainting, the plague and travelling as well as engaged couples and happy marriages as people - both single and in relationships - call on his help every February. nThe origins of what is now Valentine’s Day date back to a Roman Festival known as Lupercalia, according to History. nHeld on February , it was a fertility festival dedicated to the Roman God of Agriculture, Faunus, in which boys would draw girls’ names from a box. The subsequent pair would be partners for the festival with these matches often leading to marriage later on. nIt was outlawed at the end of the th century when Pope Gelasius I established Saint Valentine’s Day in  AD which started off as a Christian feast. Links to love didn’t come until much later. nThe first time the Valentine’s Day feast is believed to have been associated with love is Geoffrey Chaucer’s  poem ‘Parliament of Foules’. In it he described February  as the day birds found their mate: “For this was sent on Seynt Valentyne’s day   Whan every foul cometh ther to choose his mate.” nThere’s no actual record of Valentine’s Day before this poem. nThe skull of St Valentine is still in Rome and is now on display in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin where it’s adorned with flowers. But it’s not always been there. nIt was found when a catacomb near Rome was being excavated in the early th century when skeletal remains and other relics now associated with the saint were dug up. nAs is the norm for these types of finds they were then split and distributed soyou want to see other remains of St Valentine then you can in England, Scotland, Ireland, France and the Czech Republic. nInterest in Valentine’s Day started to climb in the early s when huge amounts of printed cars were sold. nBut it was in  when Hallmark Cards in Kansas City began mass producing dedicated Valentine’s Day cards that interest really took off. That, coupled with the arrival of the postage stamp, led to the start of people sending them anonymously with racy messages and poems often written inside. nThese days  million Valentine’s Day cards are sent annually in the UK with the USA sending more than  million. nThe act of signing them anonymously - as well as avoiding potential embarrassment - was started by the Victorians who thought it was bad luck to sign the cards with their actual names. nEver since the early s when Charles II of Sweden brought the Persion poetical art known as “language of flowers” to Europe, roses have symbolised love. nThe red rose was also believed to be the favourite flower of Venus, the Roman Goddess of Love, reinforcing the flower’s role in Valentine’s Day. nMeanwhile Cupid is the God of Desire, Erotic Love and Attraction. He is the son of Venus, Goddess of Love, and Mars, God of War. Cupid in Latin is ‘amor’ which means love. n\",\"usage\":,\"language\":\"en\",\"semantic_roles\":[,\"action\":,\"text\":\"is\",\"object\":,,\"action\":,\"text\":\"is

Jayne Rowland was on her way to hospital when she went into the final stages of labour in roadworks on the M in Somerset. Her partner, Joshua Mogg, called  minutes before baby Harry was born in their car on the southbound carriageway near junction . Emergency services arrived just after Harryaposs birth to find the family stopped on the inside lane of the motorway as there was no hard shoulder. The  call begins with Mr Mogg, , telling call handler Jonathan Leaton: I think sheaposs almost about to pop... Iaposm in the roadworks at  miles an hour. Mr Leaton instructed Mr Mogg, from Street, Somerset, to put his hazard lights on and pull over shortly before little Harry was born. Traffic can be heard driving past as Harryaposs mother says Hello to the newborn, followed by his father telling him: Hello mister. The couple had been travelling to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton for Ms Rowland to be induced at .am on November . Harry was born in the front passenger seat of the car at .am, just  minutes after they had left home. He weighed lb oz at birth and his birth certicate has the place of birth recorded as M. Iaposd had discomfort for around three weeks, and didnapost feel anything dferent when I woke up that day. But the pain got worse and worse in the car, so I asked Josh to pull over, the -year-old teaching assistant said. Everything seemed to happen very quickly. The call handler talked it through with us, and then the paramedics and police arrived. They all made such a dference. Weaposre so thankful. I just wanted to get to the hospital safely and on time.  It wasnapost until afterwards that I realised how much danger we were in, because there was nowhere safe to stop in the roadworks. She praised a lorry driver who shielded the family from traffic by stopping and putting his hazard warning lights on. Harry, his parents and brother Benjamin, eight, visited Taunton Ambulance Station on February  to thank the staff from South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust in person. Mr Mogg, a tree surgeon, said: Jayne was my priority. So I was first trying to get her to hospital as quickly and safely as possible. Then I just had to get out of the car and get on with it. Delivering my baby son on a motorway is probably the best thing Iaposve done in my le. I feel itaposs given me a stronger bond with Harry.

The teacher said that they had formed a aposco-dependantapos relationship while accepting that the messages were aposinappropriateapos and later resigning.The hearing was told that while studying at the school Inidual A aposdeveloped a strong relationship with McCann who provided her with supportapos and later accepted her Facebook friendship request.A colleague told the disciplinary  that the relationship aposwas entirely appropriate and helped Inidual A when she was suffering personal dficultiesapos. One message sent during work hours read: Iaposm bored now. Weaposve got to the part where the middle age women moaning about their bosses. Another said: Iaposm teaching Year  and I have to hold the tears of laughter in. They also chatted about staff members, whether they were aposMILFsapos or aposDILFs, the personal relationships of staff and their aposobsession with sex, marriage and relationshipsapos.On other occasions they referenced alcohol and drug taking.McCann gave the pupil exam papers to mark when she didnapost have time to do them, promising to pay her for the work.The , sitting at Cheylesmore House, Coventry, said her actions aposcould have serious repercussions for the educational future of those pupilsapos. However they said until the incident with the pupil McCann had an aposexemplary recordapos and she aposadmitted and accepted her actions at the earliest opportunityapos.  Banning McCann from teaching for five years, decision maker Alan Meyrick said: In the aposs view, all of the issues arose from Mrs McCannaposs initial gross misjudgement in allowing a friendship to develop with Inidual A and, thereafter, treated her as a friend and which appeared to cloud her determination as to what was appropriate, including the marking of examination papers. However, as the examinations were internal and would not have had any long-term detrimental effect on a pupilaposs education, the  determined this to be towards the lower end of the seriousness spectrum. There was no evidence that Inidual A had, in fact, been harmed by Mrs McCannaposs actions although a potential risk was present. The  also noted that the conduct had taken place in a relatively short period of time and only one pupil was directly impacted. “Mrs McCannaposs actions were capable of being remedied. She had admitted and accepted her actions at the earliest opportunity and that her behaviour had been inappropriate.

Meghan had been heavily involved in choosing women across fashion, film, tech and beyond to feature including actress Yara Shahidi, model Adwoa Aboah, climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg, activist and actor Jane Fonda, LGBTQIA+ advocate and actor Laverne Cox. In the video Meghan calls Jane Fonda whose words leave her visibly moved.

I canapost wait to see what  has in store...”To celebrate, we wanted to share this never before seen video behind the scenes with Edward and The Duchess of Sussex on the creation of this special issue. Please note, this was filmed last August in London.At the beginning of the video Edward said: We had to keep this quiet for a very long time.I remember walking into Kensington Palace and I was so excited. After agreeing to Meghan guest editing the issue the pair embarked on an almost nine months of secretive planning. Working with skeleton staff, even most Vogue staff were kept in the dark about who the star editor was. Edward said: You have an editoraposs eye. I mean Iaposve never seen anything like it. You were so thorough from beginning to end.  Meghan laughs: But I left the fashion stuff to you professionals. Praising Meghan effusively, Edward said: You wanted to focus on women who are changing the world, women who are doing incredible things. Which is really is in line with what we do at British Vogue.

The team were said to be shocked by the Megxit announcement, which hit the headlines today, but theyaposve shown a final act of loyalty through this dficult time.  A source told the Daily Mail: The Duke and Duchess have a small team, less than  people. The team are very loyal to the Sussexes and understand and respect the decision they have taken. They are all close and supporting each other.Given their decision to step back, an office at Buckingham Palace is no longer needed. While the details are still being finalised and efforts are being made to redeploy people within the royal household, unfortunately there will be some redundancies. Rather than just saying their goodbyes, the team have spent their last few weeks tirelessly working to help Meghan and Harry set up their future lives.  The source added: The team are busy helping to set their Royal Highnesses up for the future and working on a series of final engagements. Meghan and Harry have already told the Queen, Charles and William about their decision to close the office and make redundancies. Among those alleged to be in the firing line include the coupleaposs communications chief Sara Latham, who previously worked for the Obamas and Hillary Clinton, and Fiona Mcilwham, the newly appointed private secretary.

The -year-old, from Worthing, West Sussex, said: I’m terried for my little baby...I have to live every moment wonderinghe might die.” James has had severe symptoms of the virus including high temperature, coughing fits, a runny nose and severe fatigue since doctors informed his mum he had come into direct, signicant contact with the infected doc. Have you been affected by the coronavirus outbreak  Email webnews@mirror.  Speaking to The Sun, Stephanie said the test results will hopefully be released on Friday, with the highly contagious virus, originating in Wuhan, China, having already killed , people since December.With the mum-of-two and James now in self-isolation in their home, she has accused officials at Worthing Hospital of leaving them in the dark since warning the tot could be infected. She said: “We have been abandoned. I have to live every moment wonderingmy little boy might die and no one is helping me. “I’ve had nothing from the hospital. Not a ‘How are you ’ or ‘What’s going on ’ ‘How’s the baby ’ We’ve just been told to stay indoors and call our symptoms get worse.  “The first thing going through my head is that this thing is going to kill me, my son, my ex-partner and daughter. “James had a terrible temperature of .C. “He has an awful cold, a bad cough, his nose has been running. “My daughter has also been having coughing fits. “I have been feeling sick. It’s been a living nightmare.”  Stephanie slammed hospital bosses for delaying revealing that the doctor who treated James had coronavirus. The brave little tot already has haemophilia, which impairs the bodyaposs ability to make blood clots, and so stop bleeding. He had knocked his leg while playing, causing an internal bleed and was admitted to hospital on February  and during the week they both stayed there James and Stephanie came into contact with the infected GP. “One minute we’re getting his leg checked and all of a sudden we’re potential victims of this virus that is killing people across the world,” said Stephanie from her home-come-quarantine unit. Having left the hospital and arrived home with her two kids, Stephanie was contacted by Public Health England officials who warned they were at risk.  Minutes later, hazmat suit-wearing medics arrived and took them back to the hospital via ambulance for tests. Stephanie said: “We were put in a  room with just two chairs and a phone.  We sat there so scared. “I just wanted to hold my son and be close to him. “I sat there and prayed that he hadn’t got this terrible virus.” Three swabs were taken from Stephanie and James. “We had masks put around our mouths and rushed out the back of the hospital through a side door, she continued.  “We were then told to get home as quickly as possible and not to leave the house. “I suffer from really bad anxiety and waiting for these tests results has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my le.”Both James and his sister Fran, five, are having their temperatures checked every two hours while their dad Nick said previously: “We are in hell and ­completely petried. “We are ­giving the kids Calpol and ­paracetamol but nothing seems to ease their ­symptoms. “The only time we can open the door is to take food deliveries,” added the dad, who is no longer in a relationship with Stephanie.The infected GP had been at the ski chalet in the French Alps with British businessman Stephen Walsh, who has been labelled the apossuper-spreaderapos after infecting  others Brits."},{"url":null,"title":"mum sobs we nothing family","story":"w.mantis  Mum sobs we have nothing as family-of-six booted out of home after  years n EXCLUSIVE: Bryn and Leigh Davies and their four children, aged between  and , had been living in a bungalow next to a school in Hoddesdon, Herts, but claim they were evicted and given just an hour to pack up essentials n A family-of-six say they have been split up and made homeless after they were unlawfully evicted from their council home of  years.  nParents Bryn and Leigh Davies and their four children were living in a bungalow at a school where he once worked as a resident caretaker.  nBut they claim they were thrown out by Hertfordshire County Council and given just an hour to pack a few essentials to take to a hotel where they were crammed into two rooms.  nThrough tears, Mrs Davies, , said they are distressed and worried about their future, adding: We have nothing.

and , had been living in a bungalow next to a school in Hoddesdon, Herts, but claim they were evicted and given just an hour to pack up essentialsShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB

But they claim they were thrown out by Hertfordshire County Council and given just an hour to pack a few essentials to take to a hotel where they were crammed into two rooms. Through tears, Mrs Davies, , said they are distressed and worried about their future, adding: We have nothing. We were a happy family and we’ve been robbed. We just want to go home and be a family unit again. We are being treated like criminals. I’m scared I am going to lose my children. I can’t sit back and do nothing. I have four children. I have to fight for them. The Davies and their two sons - Rhys, , and George,  - are now staying in two small rooms in a converted office block  minutes from home. Their daughters - Grace, , and Emily,  - are staying where. Stay-at-home mum Mrs Davies toldthat the family moved into the three-bedroom bungalow at the now-defunct Sheredes Senior School in Hoddesdon, Herts, in January  when her husband was hired.  She said they paid £. a month in subsidised rent, were responsible for bills and maintenance, and carried out modications to accommodate Mr Daviesapos disability from severe back pain. But in July  Mr Davies, , was sacked by the school - unfairly, he claims - and the family were ordered to move out, with the council saying his right to remain in the property automatically ceased in accordance with his Service Occupancy Agreement. The family refused to leave and this led to a y legal battle that made its way to the High Court in October  and Supreme Court in . At the High Court, the Davies argued that they should be allowed to stay in the home and the council had failed to consider the welfare of their children, who were raised in the bungalow.  But the court sided with the council, saying the familyaposs right to occupy the home ended with his job and they had been trespassing ever since he was dismissed. It allowed the council to move ahead with the eviction, but remained in the bungalow, located next to the school gates, and continued to pay rent. The Davies claim they werenapost notied when the council applied for permission to enforce the writ of possession and the case went to court without their knowledge last year, meaning they werenapost giving an opportunity to mount a challenge. Mrs Davies claims the family had no idea they were being evicted until enforcement officers knocked on her door on February .  The council said since the summer of  it had asked the family a number of times to leave voluntarily, but Mr Davies refused. It said it held off from evicting the family for two years while Mr Davies appealed, and the appeals ended last summer. The eviction was authorised by the court, but the Davies claim it was unlawful because they werenapost give notice. They have launched a new challenge, arguing they were deprived of their legal right to seek a stay, and a hearing is due to take place on March .Mrs Davies, whose family have launched an online petition to publicise their case, said tearfully: There was a knock at the door and there were seven enforcement officers there to evict us. They saidwe did not go we would be arrested and face  weeks in prison. At the end of the day, there were  enforcement officers. We were told just to take emergencies like medication and paperwork and clothes. It was absolute hell, we were in pieces. It was intimidating. At that point, we had to just go.  She added: We were illegally evicted. We were never served a notice.  The whole family has been split up. We’ve been told that the bungalow is to be sold. It’s all for profit, it is greed. The council said it has not yet made a formal decision on the future of the property. Mr Davies now works as a pest control supervisor in London. His we said he has suffered from depression and anxiety, and attempted to take his own le following a mental breakdown that occurred while he was working at the school.  He claims it was brought on by bullying and harassment in the workplace. Mrs Davies said he was sacked when he was on sick leave. Sheredes School closed in  - a year after Mr Davies was dismissed - and a new academy has since opened in its place. The council doesnapost run the school, but it still owns the bungalow at the site. After being forced out of the home, the family were put in two rooms in a hotel in Great Dumlow, Essex, and then moved into a former office block in Harlow. Mrs Davies said: The most distressing thing is Iaposm not with all of my children. Thereaposs no room for all of us.  We have two studio rooms with two single beds in each but they are not next door to each other. In my room there thereaposs a wardrobe with no hanging rail, a microwave, a washing machine and dryer, a fridge, a two-wing hob and a tiny bathroom. We have nothing to do. We have no TV. My children have no toys. All of our possessions are still in the bungalow and the locks have been changed. It was my husband’s th birthday last week, his presents are still in the home. Friends are taking care of their dog, two cats and budgee. Mrs Davies said the situation has brought anxiety and stress upon the family, adding: My sons are embarrassed. My -year-old said people are laughing because they know he was sleeping on the floor on a mattress at the hotel.

He was removed from the Diamond Princess anchored in Yokohama, Japan, and taken ashore last Friday after testing positive for Covid-. He said a second test has now come back negative and he will be released from quarantinea third does the same. But he mistakenly thought that his initial test had ed negative and blamed the language barrier for the mix-up.The lorry driver from Wolverhampton said on Facebook: Seems that my first test was positive and I misunderstood due to language barrier.Anyway, second test showed negative so a third test is now been done. I need  negatives to be freed so all crossed on third test. Mr Steele, whose we Wendy is still trapped on the ship, had hoped to be released from hospital on Friday but will now have to remain in quarantine. Are you on board the ship  Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. If Mr Steele is declared virus-free, he will not be allowed to board the ship and rejoin his we. Alan and Wendy got married last month and were on their honeymoon when Mr Steele thought he had caught the virus. There have been  confirmed cases of the coronavirus strain, now officially named Covid- by the World Health Organisation, among the Diamond Princessapos , passengers and crew.

British couple David and Sally Abel said on Wednesday that le on the cruise ship, quarantined by the port of Yokohama, is becoming more challenging. The couple, who are celebrating their th wedding anniversary, said passengers had been kept awake one night due to a woman crying in her cabin.  Mrs Abel added: They are looking after us very well but obviously we are confined to our cabin and itaposs getting harder. We are now into the second week, it seems an eternity to go. Mr Abel said: It is more challenging, as each day progresses we are having additional people testing positive.

But his swaggering announcement of HS for London and the Midlands gave few clues about this pie-in-the-Pennines project. No start date, no deadline for completion, no schedule for the trains to begin running. No budget for such an ambitious enterprise, and most glaringly, no details of the route it might take. Publicity maps offer only a pretty coloured line pivoting neatly between our two great northern cities, asthe intervening ,ft-high hills don’t exist. HS will cut journey times by half to only  minutes, boasts “the vision.”Yes, and I will ascend Mount Everest on a pogo stick, clutching a gin and tonic and singing the Hallelujah Chorus. The Victorians knew a thing or two about building railways. They chose river valleys to get through the Pennines, inevitably following a winding path. Even so, they had to blast their way through three-mile long Standedge tunnel, at the cost of dozens of navvies’ lives. Transport for the North is shy about embarrassing details like the route, the cost, and the timeline.My request for information went unanswered. In this theatre of the absurd, there is heated debate as to who gets what.

I want to empower everyone with the knowledge that relationships can be transformed and to offer strategies to make this change possible. I had to make an awful lot of mistakes in my le, over and over again for many years, to learn this.And now, in my book Seven Things That Make or Break a ­Relationship, I am ready to reveal my scientically proven love strategy using the power of your conscious and unconscious mind. A rich, rewarding relationship is one of the greatest sources of happiness in the world. But relationships that are stuck in negativity cause suffering and sadness. The techniques you are about to learn will re-code the habits of your conscious mind. And the good news is that the system works for everyone – even those who have given up hope... When I was a young man, I had my heart broken, so my ­unconscious mind began preventing me from getting really close to anyone. I wasn’t deliberately trying to wreck my relationships but my mind was repeating the protective action even when I no longer needed it and until it was programmed into my behaviour. It was a form of self-protection. I described myself as “commitment phobic” and, in , I told an interviewer: “I’m not built for relationships.” I didn’t have a problem getting together with women but I did not seem to be able to make a relationship last. As this pattern emerged, I developed two unhelpful beliefs. In the first I saw myself as the victim of a pattern: I could not stop choosing the wrong woman. In the second I believed I could not stop myself sabotaging my own happiness. My unconscious mind knew I had been hurt in the past and it manufactured disagreements so that we would split up before it became too painful. One day a good friend pointed out to me that the common denominator in all my relationship problems was me. It was me who needed to change.  Later I was to discover that even more powerful changes were at work. When I came across the love strategy, it was a complete revelation. Up until then I constantly wondered why I was trying so hard to show the other person that I really cared about them. Things I said or did had no impact, no matter how hard or often I tried. It was so frustrating, as though I was speaking another language. I remember being mystied at how I seemed to cause offence even when I was being grateful. “Don’t you like it ” she said – after giving me a gt. “Of course I do,” I replied. “I’m going to put it somewhere special later.” “So you don’t like it ” came the reply.  Then I learned the love strategy and everything changed. I was able to communicate how I felt and I was understood. I realised that the person who gave me that gt was visual. She expected me to look at it, examine it and put it right in front of me. It also became clear that my own preferred mode of thinking is auditory. This means that while I am grateful for a gt, I am truly toucheda person tells me in a meaningful, authentic way that they love me. The following techniques are deceptively simple but will make all the dference in the world to the intimacy in your relationships, as they did to me. How your partner thinks Listen carefully. Do they predominantly use words to paint pictures  If so, they are probably “visual”.Do they enjoy talking or listening to music  If so, they are probably “auditory”.People with a “kinaesthetic” or tactile preference will say “Let’s touch upon this” or “That feels good”. Notice the direction in which people tend to look when searching their memory to answer questions. Visuals tend to look up, auditory to the side and kinaesthetic downwards. When you have established their preferred mode, begin to attune your language to theirs so they feel understood and appreciated. For visual partners... Use visual metaphors in your lan­­guage.Show your love with acts of ser­­vice and visible gts like flowers, paintings and written messages. Use your phone to send them pictures and photos. Take them to the cinema and to beautul places. For auditory partners... Use auditory metaphors in your language.Show your love by telling them meaningfully about what you appreciate about them.Find out what sort of music they like and find more of it. When you agree with them, don’t just nod but offer positive verbal affirmation. For kinaesthetic partners... Show your love with hugs and touches. Buy them presents that are rewarding to hold and to use. Join them in physical activities such as walking, dancing, tennis or sailing. We all use all modes to some extent, so when you have an important message to convey you will have maximum impact when you talk to the person in a direct and meaningful tone, look them in the eye and touch them in an ­appropriate way.  Andyou are receiving a gt or an important emotional communication, hold the gt or touch the person in an appropriate way, look at the gt carefully or look at the person as you say something thoughtful and appreciative. Your attention is a form of energy and it is one of the most powerful gts you have. The more you pay attention, the richer your relationship will become. And take your phone off the table – it takes your attention even by the ­possibility of alerts. Keep flirting, even long after you have agreed to be in a relationship. It is fun and leads to better sex, which is perhaps the nicest form of communication.There is a psychologist in Seattle who can predict with  per cent accuracy, and after just  minutes of conversation, whether a couple will stay together. Dr John Gottman, of the Gottman Institute, has spent the past  years analysing the conversations of couples and has discovered the four actions that create happy, long-lasting relationships.

Jaxon Watts was just seven-months-old when he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that is so rare there were only  cases known worldwide and he was the only sufferer in the UK. Susie Watts and her partner Tom were told Jaxon had Primitive Myxoid Mesenchymal Tumor of Infancy , an extremely rare soft tissue tumour.The tragic tot was unable to have surgery because the tumour surrounds main arteries so staff at Alder Hey and Great Ormand Street deemed it too risky to operate on, the Liverpool Echo reports.Other attempts to remove the cancer have failed and the two-year-old has gone home with his parents under the palliative care of Claire House Childrenaposs Hospice. Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Susie, , said: At the time he was diagnosed, there were only  cases known worldwide. Jaxon is the only case in the UK and they know itaposs a chemo-resistant tumour, so really the first line of action is to have surgery then have chemo to get rid of any remaining cells. If they donapost get all the tumour out, it grows back more aggressively. His tumour surrounds his main arteries so they couldnapost operate. They wanted to give chemo a go - for a while, it stopped the growth but it would make him really ill so they had to stop and have a rethink.  Jaxon and his family, who are from Chester, lived at Alder Hey hospital for nine months while a iety of combinations of chemotherapy were tried, as well as other treatments and experimental trials. In March , Jaxon started a clinical trial at Manchester Childrenaposs Hospital though the family were still linked with Alder Hey. Susie said: We managed to get him on a trial drug at Manchester Childrenaposs but we were still linked with Alder Hey and he made loads of improvements. He started crawling, he started eating for the first time - heaposs never been able to eat because the tumour puts pressure on his abdomen so heaposd vomit violently straight afterwards. He has to be fed through his central line.  On the trial drug, he was full of energy and we knew the tumour was still growing but the new drug had dramatically slowed it down. Then, last December, we noticed he had a swelling on his forehead and we found his cancer had spread to his skull and his spine. The drug had managed to prolong his le in the trial, which was amazing, but then the cancer spread and it had metastatised. We looked at other trials but then he came down with chicken pox and in that time, he deteriorated to the point where we couldnapost start the new trial.

after failing to get any work since she left school at  - despite applying for  jobs a dayShareCommentsByAnn DixonLorraine King:,  FEB NewsSarah Duffin has never had a job since she left school  years ago \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAn unemployed woman who has been on the dole since she left school  years ago is desperate for a job Sarah Duffin just wants to be given a chance and even applied for up to  jobs in one day. If any job came up, Miss Duffin says she would take it, but it is her dream to set up a business selling jam, curds and her own home grown produce.After failing to land a job since she left school at  with no qualications, the -year-old has known nothing  but signing on the dole, reports Hull Live. But she is begging for employment and claims she will work anywhere, anytime as anything just to get her foot on the job ladder. She said: Itaposs so disheartening and I donapost know what Iaposd do without my mum as she is my rock and otherwise Iaposd just give in.Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirrorIaposve done courses on employability skills, health and safety, catering and food hygiene, English, maths, IT and Iaposve done so many dferent types of volunteering, including at charity shops, but none of it has got me anywhere. The other day I applied for  jobs in a day and didnapost get a single interview. Even though Sarah has attended many courses, she claims that she cannot find work because she has no practical experience, despite sending off hundreds of job applications each week. Just this month, Miss Duffin told Hull Live that her her ambitions to work in catering are being hampered by being forced to attend employability sessions and apply for cleaning roles, instead of volunteering in a kitchen to gain experience.  Despite the Department of Work and Pensions authorising her volunteer placement, and allaying her fears of being sanctioned should she not attend the employability sessions run by Standguide, Sarah has hit yet another brick wall by missing out on the opportunity. Because of all the faffing about with me trying to volunteer at St Margaretaposs Welcome Centre in Longhill as a kitchen assistant volunteer, whilst at the same time fighting the DWP to let me attend, Iaposve missed out on the opportunity and now Iaposm back to square one all over again, she said. I had a spark of hope when I thought I could do my volunteering, but now Iaposm lonely, down, desperate and suicidal all over again. All I want is to work and be given a chance. Iaposll work anywhere, anytime as anything and Iaposm reliable and trustworthy and just want someone to set me on.  Every two weeks, Miss Duffin gets £ every two weeks on benefits which she says she struggles to survive on, and previously told Hull Live she had been left unable to get help to get a job because of her age. She has put herself forward for education courses at ious institutions but, as these are mainly aimed at  to -year-olds, has been unable to gain a place. Despite applying for hundreds of jobs, Miss Duffin has been left with many unanswered applications, or has been turned down after going for interviews. On top of her jobseeking woes, the situation at home is also tough for Miss Duffin, who has never been able to get her own place and independence due to her finances.

Holly Valentine, , lives in LA but often travels around the world with work so decided to join the dating app as a way to meet people while exploring new cities. She signed up for the paid for version of the site, which allows you to see people in anywhere in the world, and uploaded a number of cute snaps. While she often shares saucy photos on her Instagram page, she insists all the photos on her dating profile were clean because sheaposs shy when it comes to dating. But Holly claims that within just a few hours of signing up with was inundated with messages from matches insisting her account was fake. She was soon locked out of the app, and when she tried to redownload it and sign in it wouldnapost work. She said: I travel a lot so I wanted to date and meet new people when I was traveling and in town, so I bought the most expensive package that they offer that lets you set your location to anywhere. It’s like  which for an app is expensive! I used clean pictures, did everything I was supposed to, swiped right on a couple people, I got some matches and then started binge watching Game of Thrones. Then after a couple hours I went back on saw a couple previews of messages and then got locked out of the app.The previews that I did see were “you’re probably not real”, “why would a girl like you be on tinder”, “why won’t you answer! ! ” “I didn’t even get to meet anyone or even really use the app. She contacted Tinder to find out what was going on and says she was given a full refund but no explanation. Holly wanted to try out the popular app as sheaposs shy when it comes to dating. She says she often gets marriage proposals on her Instagram account, along with strange requests from men who tell her to reach out to their wives and bosses at workthey fail to obey her She said: “I have a lot of respect for people with fetishes so it takes a lot to weird me out, but the one I am always shocked by is when guys want me to ‘ruin them’ and reach out to their wives or girlfriends or even jobsthey don’t obey me. “I’ve done it once and I could never do it again. Most of the time the requests are pretty normal though.” Despite her provocative appearance, Holly insisted she has always been a genuine “girl next door” and has a nerdy side she is not afraid to show.  She said: “Iaposm all natural, very fit, blonde, girl next door looking. I do have a nerdy side and I’m not afraid to show it but depending on the wardrobe or makeup I can go from looking like an all natural college girl or a bombshell. “I’m extremely real and people know that the first second. When people meet me in real le the first thing they say is ‘you’re exactly the same in real le’. “A lot of people are going for the ‘girl next door’ vibe but that’s just who I am.” Holly keeps herself busy preparing and uploading content on her sites throughout the week, waking up as early as am every morning for photoshoots, YouTube collaborations and planning brand strategies with her team. She said: “Half the week I’m shooting waking up at am, doing hair and makeup, shooting stuff for Instagram and my subscription s and then I’m usually answering emails and then taking photos for my company’s Instagram.  Sometimes I’ll do YouTube as well or collaborate with other models or influencers. The rest of the week I am at my office working with the branding team. Sometimes my Instagram actually comes into the mix there as wellwe are trying to promote something or reach out to contacts I’ve made from doing Instagram as an influencer.” Sheaposs also a member of the private social media app OnlyFans, where she posts private content to fans on a subscription basis - and is now one of the siteaposs top earners.  Holly insisted she uses the money earned from OnlyFans to help her business take off, reinvesting the funds back into her company branding. She said: “I had never done anything like that and I was really curious but I was working in an office every day and just didn’t think I could do it. Then I met a girl who did it and I just kind of went for it.

It was going in but Kane is a good striker and good strikers make sure –he wants the goal, he can have it!“The main thing was to get the win and a clean sheet as well – I would trade the goal for a clean sheet, to be honest.”Saturday’s shutout was Dundee’s first since they last met the Jags on December  and their first at Dens since October .“We got a lot of clean sheets at the start of the season and I think we came away from basing our game on that,” added Forster.“It’s nice to be back in the team, not quite scoring, but helping us get three points.“It was a blustery day and conditions on the pitch weren’t brilliant.“I think we made the best of it and got the best possible outcome.“The boys played well, we were really dficult to beat and we made a big thing of getting to second balls and closing people down.“We worked harder than we have been – that can be a hard thing to say to players but I think it has showed in the last couple of games where we have really got after teams and put them under pressure. Other teams do that to us and it’s dficult to deal with.”The victory puts Dundee back in the play-off spots as they retook fourth place.“The league is very tight. There have been a lot of tough games recently and I’m sure everyone was looking at the league table and saying ‘ we win this, we go there,we lose, we’re here’, that’s human nature.“We were fully aware of how big and important Saturday’s game was.“Come pm, we’ve won - and getting the three points is good news. It was a good day all round.”The Dark Blues head into a two-week break in good mood after ending their run without victory ahead of a trip to Queen of the South on February .“It’s human nature,you lose then there’s two weeks to think about that until the next one.“It was nice to get the three points after the previous few weeks and gives us something to work on for the next game.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e412bd36c42b5.58947449-940x547.jpg ","title":"kane better than first dundee spell","story":"James McPake says top goalscorer Kane Hemmings is a better player now than his previous goal-laden spell at Dens Park.The -year-old took his tally this season to nine league goals with a brace to see off Partick Thistle on Saturday.His manager was quick to praise the impact made by his frontman saying goals are guaranteedthey can provide chances.Hemmings scored  times in   while the Dark Blues were heading for the Premiership top six. Five years later, though, James – who was a team-mate at the time – says he’s a better all-round player.“I’ve known him for a long time but Kano’s a better player now than he was when he was here before, no doubt about it,” said McPake.“We’ve just not been supplying him with enough chances. It’s a guarantee – you supply Kane with chances and he scores goals.“People have been wanting me to be critical of our fans for getting on our backs but Kane Hemmings in the first five minutes chased a ball down into the corner and got the full place going.“That’s what I mean by saying we need to give the fans something to get behind. It can be as simple as that because the fans see that the players out there are hurting.“Kano started that off and finished the game with two very good goals.”James was delighted with the overall performance of his side against the Jags.“It was a thoroughly deserved win,” he added. I thought it was a controlled performance from start to finish.“I can’t remember our goalie making a save. We were assured as a team, particularly in defence. I thought the three centre-backs were outstanding.” vw, px\"  There was bad news for Ross Callachan, however, after X-rays confirmed he’d suffered a broken fibula late in the game.James said: “I’m gutted for Ross Callachan.“Since he’s came to this club, he’s been outstanding.“Above all , he’s a good guy and a good guy in our dressing-room. It’s a sore one for everyone because he’d shown me what a valuable player he could be for us.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee emerge from the ashes and why lawrence shankland is just getting started","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan discuss how Dundee got their season back on track, Lawrence Shankland’s pledge that more is to come and the Walk and Talk men’s mental health event.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"screechy-boards-steamed-pudding-kelvinside-academy-memories","story":"GUY ROBERTSON, AD AGENCY BOSS"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-wallace-bruce-glasgow-bishop-shaped-scotlands-history","story":"ONE of the most puzzling aspects of Scotlandrsquos wars of independence is the way that prominent figures often changed allegiances, especially in the period when Robert the Bruce was fighting for ndash and indeed murdering his enemies for ndash the throne of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"oz-glasgow-memories-judy","story":"THE story of Judy Garlandrsquos le continues to fascinate film-makers ndash the latest movie about the Hollywood star who shot to fame after playing Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, is currently lighting up cinemas and winning awards around the world."},{"url":null,"title":"70k-raised-place-mandela-statue-glasgow","story":"FUNDRAISING for a statue of Nelson Mandela in Glasgow has been stepped up on the th anniversary of his release from prison."},{"url":null,"title":"ewan-mcgregor-moves-los-angeles-get-away-soulless-selfies","story":"Ewan McGregor has swapped the UK for LA to escape fans \"soulless\" selfies."},{"url":null,"title":"students-campaign-glasgow-universitys-3m-arms-trade-stake-re-engagement-fossil-fuels","story":"Glasgow University students have gathered in the institutionsquads to protest over the its involvement with the arms trade and potential re-engagement with fossil fuel investments."},{"url":null,"title":"mini-golf-course-set-st-enoch-centre-plans-approved","story":"A MINI-GOLF course is set to open in the St Enoch Centre, a move which will see world famous toy store Hamleys downsize."},{"url":null,"title":"public-can-help-shape-glasgows-response-ecological-emergency","story":"GLASGOWrsquoS response to the climate and ecological emergency can be shaped by the public after the council launched a new consultation."},{"url":null,"title":"dr-punam-krishan-farting-normal-talk","story":"Because everybody farts, itrsquos normal you see,"},{"url":null,"title":"city-science-plutos-journey-fascinating-one-planet-continues-surprise-us","story":"NEXT week marks  years since Plutorsquos discovery.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations.

We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"winning start to new year for star youths","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Now kicked off with a flying start for both Red Star s and s.The s headed to Glasgow in a top of the table clash against Glasgow Boys.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

After the session, as the children were heading for lunch, a girl from the class came up and said: ldquoI think the moral in that tale is that we should be kind, but that itrsquos often not easy to do.It was a traditional tale in which the tables are turned on a selfish rich man who had shown no compassion, but then hoped for kindness when he was the one in need. In the brief discussion with this young person, we agreed that itrsquos easier to show kindness to someone who we believe truly deserves it.She told me: ldquoI think the woman in the story did the right thing butIrsquom being honest,it had been me I donrsquot knowIrsquod have been able to be kind like her, because Irsquod have wanted revenge. Thatrsquos the problem, I think, we always think about revenge first. It can make us feel better for a short while but really makes things worse, well at least not better anyway. I try to be kind, sometimes it isnrsquot easy, but I try. Kindness is like a seed we have to plant.I shouldnrsquot have been bowled over by this, for I know a -year-old can have wisdom that many so called grown-ups have forgotten. But I was deeply impressed by her reflection on the storyrsquos message, and her honesty and integrity.This conversation also revealed the power of stories to raise moral dilemmas and human issues without finger pointing or being preachy.And she is right, it can often be very dficult to be kind. The world seems so full of stress, selfishness, anger and intolerance that there seems little space for kindness, except towards those we love and care about. On top of that, it seems increasingly dficult to survive, keep a roof above our heads and pay the bills. Kindness begins at home and often there is little energy, emotion or resources left to think or care about others we arenrsquot responsible for.There can even be a real fear thatwe show lsquotoo muchrsquo kindness we risk becoming a doormat, being used or treated unfairly. We can sometimes watch a child being kind to another and it not being reciprocated, and the temptation then is to suggest kindness isnrsquot shown next time.ldquoWe need to teach people a lesson, is often the mantra which derails our instinct to be kind another way of saying we want revenge. And letrsquos be honest: cruel, uncaring and selfish people can take advantage of someonersquos kindness and revenge does often make us feel better, in the short term anyway.But is the answer to allow unkind behaviour to frame the way we want to live and be treated  Do we respond to unkindness with more unkindness in   So consequently, cruelty with more cruelty, intolerance with more intolerance, selfishness with yet more selfishness  Doesnrsquot this mean that we allow lsquothe lessonrsquo to be that kindness doesnrsquot pay  As Gandhi is famously reported to have said: ldquoAn eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.The truth is, kindness is not weakness but strength. It often isnrsquot easy and takes great courage. It doesnrsquot mean that people should not face consequences for their actions, or that people should be asked to forgive the unforgivable. But it does mean not allowing the unkindness of others to define how we are. We should not allow such acts to clip our butterfly wings.What do I mean by this  There is a theory called the lsquobutterfly effectrsquo. In this theory, it is said that the flapping of a butterflyrsquos wings could cause a chain reaction in which a hurricane could be caused on the other side of the planet. It is not meant to be taken literally, but to show that a very small act, although seemingly insignicant in itself, can have huge, unforeseen repercussions.In this way, kindness is a butterfly. Small acts of kindness may have a huge effect that touches people beyond the knowledge of the person who displayed the kindness. Acts of cruelty and hate also have the same power but all the more reason to flutter the wings of kindness so the wind more likely blows in the right direction.In this way, our behaviour is a butterfly. The way we flap its wings can have huge unforeseeable consequences, either for good or bad, both for ourselves and others. When we are kind, we actually makes ourselves happier too.So to make a real dference, we need only do tiny acts that are easily within our power, and as often as we can. A smile, a moment you truly listen to someone, a helping hand, holding the door open, trying to understand how someone feels, making a cup of tea, not meeting anger with anger, trying not to gain revenge but a change of heart and so on.This is what will truly make up the index of a healthy and happy society. And all of us can be players in this, and beneficiaries of our own kindness.David W Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics, has said: ldquoThe plain fact is that the planet does not need more successful people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers and lovers of every kind.Great words, but that -year-old school girl already got this. Young people like her give me hope for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"john-muir-house-car-park-opened-public","story":"The car park, off Court Street, is home to about  spaces but can only be used by council employees and council HQ visitors between am and pm during the working week.That could soon change, with a number of spaces potentially being made available for public weekday daytime use.The idea comes as the council looks to increase the overall number of short and long stay car parking spaces in and around the town centre.Last year, discussions took place with members of the public surrounding the idea of creating a lsquotransport hubrsquo off the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.Now, a further two-day consultation is taking place in Haddington Town House, when members of the public can discuss parking issues in the town.The consultation will focus on parking throughout Haddington, including possibly changing the long-stay car park near the townrsquos Tesco store into a short-stay car park.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoFor many years, wersquove been keen to enhance the town centre so that it offers the best possible environment for all users ndash including people with restricted mobility, pedestrians and cyclists ndash to ensure easy access to the local services and businesses on which Haddington depends.ldquoAs well as improved options for active travel and public transport, we recognise there is a need to create more parking spaces in and around the town centre.ldquoFor this to happen, we need to change some existing parking from long stay to short stay, and deliver a new long-stay parking option for drivers who need to leave their vehicle in the town throughout the working day.ldquoOne proposal is the potential re-designation of the existing lsquoTesco long-stayrsquo car park, which could free up an additional  spaces in the town centre for short-stay, public parking.ldquoWe will also review the status of the car park at John Muir House, East Lothian Councilrsquos head office, to consider the potential for an area here to be available for wider public use.More than  people attended the previous exhibition in the Town House.

Any time I think back to my childhood, she was there. Not inside cooking and cleaning, but out in the sunshine with us, teaching us how to swim, picking brambles, and chatting to anyone who would listen.She would brighten up your day. I remember her sitting beside my bed calming me down when I was particularly anxious until I got to sleep.She never followed a recipe, was a terrible cook, an astounding jam maker and an amazing baker. She would laugh until she cried, make a tea bag last over  cups and several hours and swim in Lough Foyle every month of the year. For years after leaving home I would talk to her regularly on the phone and she would always know what to say when I needed reassurance.About ten years ago, my dad started to mention little things that were worrying him. She said that she couldnrsquot wind up our electric clock and found it hard to follow simple conversations on TV shows. This progressed to more problematic issues, like putting the electric kettle on the gas stove to heat the water, forgetting how to use the washing machine and not being able to find her way back home from her swim,  minutesrsquo walk away.After several consultations, which initially didnrsquot find any issues , a diagnosis of vascular dementia was finally confirmed. Our cousin, who is a GP, recognised the signs and encouraged us to follow up until we had a clear diagnosis.The first few years were very hard. We were all learning how to deal with repeated questions and she was getting frustrated at forgetting how to do things and losing her independence. Looking back, she was probably very frightened, and for the first time in our lives she would be argumentative and sometimes rude. This was not the mammy we remembered and it was a steep learning curve.Even more dficult was Dadrsquos adjustment to being a carer. He had been brought up in a devout Catholic family to believe that le was supposed to be hard and that lsquoin sickness and in healthrsquo meant that he had to do it all. He did a fantastic job cooking, cleaning and supporting mammy at home but he found it so dficult to lose his bright, caring and sunny we bit by bit and sank into depression.It was a horrible time, with Dadrsquos depression becoming so bad that we were afraid he would take his own le. Thankfully, after some very frank conversations, he started a prescription of antidepressants, which improved the situation almost instantly.Although we slowly managed to get care at home to help out, the situation finally got so bad that mammy was admitted into hospital with a severe infection and it was clear that she would need -hour nursing care from then on.We were lucky that my family had enough savings to privately pay for care in a specialised dementia nursing home. Others arenrsquot so fortunate and I have heard heartbreaking stories from friends of poor care provision and long waiting times.Mammy was very well looked after at the home and enjoyed the social interaction and opportunities to chat to everyone that passed. The staff loved her and I often bumped into strangers visiting her because she was such delightful company, eventhey didnrsquot know her.We made her a memory book and she loved hearing the stories about our lives and looking at the pictures. Dad visited every day and used to sing songs and pray with her. She never forgot songs and poems and could sing and recite better than I could.The hardest thing for me was when my mammy no longer recognised me. I was grateful that she always knew I was someone close to herbut it wasnrsquot the same.After three years in the nursing home, mammy stopped eating and drinking and ended up in hospital again with an infection but her body was exhausted and she was ready to go. I thought I had done all my grieving over the years she had dementia but the physical pain when she died was intolerable.Although she lost her memories and understanding, she had kept the twinkle in her eye and the ability to connect with those around her.

The way things are going itrsquoll likely be a bridge between two independent countries.There is Sinn Fein winning the popular vote in Ireland and demanding a referendum on reunication. And Scotland is to have one next year, according to Nicola Sturgeon.Well, in your dreams.Therersquos unlikely to be a Scottish referendum any time soon. Sinn Fein is in no position to demand a border poll, while it remains a minority in the Irish parliament, the Dail.It wasnrsquot only or even mainly Sinn Feinrsquos policy on a United Ireland that drove leader May Lou McDonaldrsquos success. The campaign focused on housing, health and pensions.Moreover, not everyone in the Republic is enthusiastic about reuniting with the North. Even some nationalists worry about taking responsibility for the pound billion or so the UK pumps annually into The Six Counties, as Sinn Feincalls the province.Then therersquos all the sectarianism and the legacy of the Troubles. Unionist paramilitaries havenrsquot gone away either. This makes it all the more remarkable that what used to be the political wing of the Irish Republican Army has become a major player in Irish politics. SF was regarded as de facto terrorist itself until recently. The idea it could ever get near forming a governing coalition was regarded as ridiculous.But after this election, Sinn Fein can no longer be dismissed as a relic of sectarianism. It came top with  per cent of the popular vote against  per cent for Fianna Dail and  per cent for Leo Varadkarrsquos Fine Gael. Had Mary Lou McDonald fielded more candidates, SF might have won more than its  seats in the Dail, one fewer than Fianna Faacuteil. It was a rare case of a political party actually under-estimating its electoral support.Seismic is an overused term in politics,but this election really is earthshaking, not least for the future of the UK. Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael Taoiseach, has been looking suitably shaken.He insists he will not contemplate any alliance with ldquoextremist Sinn Feiners, one of whose TDs launched into a rendition of the Irish rebel song ldquoCome out ye Black and Tans at a Dublin count. Michael Martin of Fianna Faacuteil isnrsquot ruling out a coalition but is instinctively hostile.The establishment parties will do all in their power to lock Sinn Fein out of office during the coming weeks of coalition horse trading. But it seems unlikely they can keep the charismatic Mary Lou in her box.This is because nationalism is back in a big way in Ireland as in the UK. Yes, the grievances of young people without housing and older folk worried about pensions arenrsquot intrinsically nationalist. But these grievances are now being expressed by voting for the party of Irish nationalism par excellence.It is similar to the way many Scottish voters, with similar complaints, turned suddenly to the independence cause in , obliterating Labour in Scotland.Radical nationalism is now the driving force in modern politics. It is redrawing the political map across Europe as voters turn away from neoliberalism and globalism.We see it in the Yellow Vest movement in France, in populist parties in Italy and, yes, even in Brexit. That was essentially an English nationalist rebellion against the EU.The BBCrsquos former World Affairs Editor, John Simpson, attracted much criticism for tweeting his regret that Ireland had ldquosuccumbed to populism. The implication is that Sinn Fein remain extremist and its success is a bad thing.Commentators like Simpson used to say much the same about Alex Salmondrsquos SNP. Many metropolitan intellectuals still regard populism as synonymous with racism and bigotry.But this equation of nationalist movements with the political right makes little sense. Both the SNP and Sinn Fein triumphed from the left. All nationalisms not the same.Fianna Faacuteil and Fine Gael are also nominally nationalist parties, dating from the Irish Civil War. Theyrsquore ldquoSoldiers of Destiny and ldquoTribe of the Irish respectively. Sinn Fein, meaning ldquoWe Ourselves actually sounds less militantly nationalist.In recent years theyrsquove become identikit centrist parties. Fine Gael is generally considered slightly more right wing and pro big business than Fianna Faacuteil, which used to represent farmers and small business. But itrsquos hard to tell. The two old parties are basically rival networks of patronage, cronyism even, with little ideological depth.Fianna Faacuteil had the misfortune to be in office during the  financial crash, which hit Ireland hard. The country was traumatised by the weight of debt left by the collapse of the Irish banks.Fine Gael under its seemingly more progressive Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, thought it had inherited the upswing. In GDP terms it has. Ireland has one of the highest growth rates in Europe and national income per head is higher than the UKrsquos.Mr Varadkar, who is openly gay, won plaudits for legalising abortion and same-sex marriage. But this progressive gloss did not prevent Fine Gael being seen as in the pockets of rampant capitalism.He won the battle of Brexit too, but lost the war for domestic popularity as young and old turned in disgust from the grotesque inequalities of wealth in Ireland. Brexit was not, by common consent, a signicant issue in the election. But it must have played a part,only subliminally.The North is to remain in regulatory alignment with the Republic, while Britain erects a border in the Irish Sea. This de facto economic reunication of Ireland has transformed the border question.Itrsquos no longer a question of Brits out. Theyrsquore going. Irish nationalism is no longer about the gun, but about the EU single market. The dream of Irish unity is becoming a reality through the ballot box. Formal unication seems only a matter of time.The SNP has historically shunned Sinn Fein, fearing guilt by association. That must surely now change. It is now a legitimate democratic force.But there is a warning here for Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP canrsquot afford to abandon its left-wing radicalism, or trade it for LGBT and gender politics. If the SNP becomes another party of the establishment it could share the fate of Leo Varadkar."},{"url":null,"title":"cabinet-reshuffle-andrea-leadsom-northern-ireland-secretary-cabinet-revamp","story":"Mr Smith, who served as Northern Ireland Secretary, said on Twitter: \"Serving the people of Northern Ireland has been the biggest privilege.

At least, it shouldnt be. Its a day to focus on all the loves - eros, yes, but agape, pragma, storge.Love seems to be missing from so many social interactions, from the failure to offer a seat on the bus to someone who looks like they need it more to snapping at the barista because the queue in your regular coffee shop is long.As increasing numbers of psychological studies have shown that love and gratitude is a way of increasing wellbeing while lowering stress and depression, keeping a gratitude diary has become a recommended daily task.Of course, as with every possible element of living, gratitude diaries have become a fashion - a way of companies commercialising our attempts to improve our lives and lower our worries.You dont need a written diary to pause to think about the small things in le. To do so is an act of love and care also.I love to cycle home in the middle of the night by myself when the air is clear and theres no one around, just the whirr and rumble of the tyres as they make dferent noises over dferent road textures.I take immense pleasure in a loose leaf cup of tea.When the world outside is vast and frightening and burning, the tiny things help to centre and ground.

To head north on the A to Glasgow, travellers need to negotiate the streets of Stranraer and the same appliesyou want to connect to the A, which is the road used by traffic heading from here to England. On a good day and with a fair wind, the journey time by car to Glasgow or Carlisle from Portpatrick takes more than two hours.

Going south, there are only a few overtaking opportunities towards Dumfries, then you face  miles of single carriageway from there to Gretna where you reach the M.

Without a complete roads upgrade, the Portpatrick area will not cope with the current amount of traffic from Ireland let alone any increase.In terms of road and transport links , we are the forgotten corner. Any feasibility study regarding a Celtic bridge must include the total cost infrastructure, dualling of both the A and A, together with the impact on Portpatrick, the surrounding rich farmland, not to mention job losses from the closure of the ferry services out of Cairnryan, which incidentally are extremely efficient and well run and get you to Northern Ireland in two hours. The ferries are rarely cancelled. We have had winds of more than mph here, on a daily basis, for the best part of a week. The frequency of high winds here is increasing.

Irsquom not a member of the SNP, but I am a Green , and support both independence for Scotland, and our membership of the EU. So perhaps hersquoll accept a reply to his question from me I worked as a consultant on the economics of a direct Rosyth-Zeebrugge ferry in the s. I read the report produced by Scottish Enterprise on the subject, and can tell Mr Clark exactly why the Rosyth service failed.The Scottish Enterprise study examined the success of the ferry between Ancona in Italy, and Greece, despite a much shorter crossing from Bari, further south in Italy. It compared this to a service from Rosyth, and the similarly-existing shorter sea crossing from the Humber, more than  miles further south. And concluded that therefore, there was a good chance of a Rosyth ferry succeeding,it could win a small share of the Humberrsquos market.Alas, Scottish Enterprise ndash this was under a Tory government of course ndash failed to take account of one simple and glaringly obvious fact. Italian autostrada are tolled, and UK motorways, with wee exceptions, are not. Large trucks from industrial northern Italy therefore saved not only driversrsquo wages, fuel, tyre and vehicle depreciation coststhey used Ancona. They also saved hefty road tolls. I pointed this out to the clients for whom I was working as consultant, and since they didnrsquot like it, I resigned from the contract. They wanted to hear arguments why Rosyth would work.

Two traps were in place over four months. It is a massive task to separate all the inidual insects caught.But Mr Strachan is still painstakingly separating out the samples and taking advice from a dozen dferent experts to help with identications.The new-to-Britain flies were represented by just one male of each species, out of over , fungus gnats Ian had in turn separated out from tens of thousands of other insects in the sample.ldquoThis was a very exciting find.

A considerable number of specimens remain to be sorted and or identied.ldquoIt is a very laborious process. It could be several years before all the species are identied but I am determined to get as many as possible done, he said.Woodland Trust Scotland has partnered with Arkaig Community Forest, a local community-based charity, which shares ambitious plans to restore native woodland habitats across the entire forest and demonstrate the ecological, social and economic value of ancient woodland restoration.In particular, it aims to support the remote community living around the forest to benefit from active sustainable forest management activities such as woodfuel production, eco-tourism and adding value to timber.The hazel gloves fungus was spotted by retired Countryside Ranger Richard Wesley from Cullipool on the Isle of Luing, during a recent visit to Dunollie Wood by Lorn Natural History Group.ldquoAfter resting on a log, I looked down and to my surprise spotted a windblown twig with a small sample of hazel gloves, as though it had been placed there for me to find, he said.The group then set about searching the area for more substantial examples. Cynthia Grindley and Noelle Odling found the fungus on two standing trees. Woodland Trust Scotland staff subsequently identied hazel gloves at two further spots.Hypocreopsis rhododendri, the hazel gloves fungus, is a priority species on the UK Bioersity Acton Plan and Scottish Bioersity List.ldquoHazel gloves is an indicator of high quality temperate rainforest so we are really pleased it has been identied at Dunollie Wood, said George Anderson of Woodland Trust Scotland.ldquoIt might surprise a lot of people to know that Oban is a town with a rainforest at its back.ldquoLast year we formed the Atlantic Woodland Alliance, a partnership with other landowners, community and conservation groups which aims to secure a better future for this dwindling habitat.ldquoScotlandrsquos rainforest is just as lush and just as important as tropical rainforest, but is even rarer.ldquoIt is found along the west coast and on the inner isles and is a unique habitat of ancient native oak, birch, ash, pine and hazel woodlands and includes open glades and river gorges.ldquoOur rainforest relies on mild, wet and clean air coming in off the Atlantic, and is garlanded with a spectacular array of lichens, fungi, mosses, liverworts and ferns.ldquoMany are nationally and globally rare and some are found nowhere  in the world."},{"url":null,"title":"outlander-fans-can-tour-sites-thanks-new-audio-guide","story":"Now fans of Outlander can take an audio guide around the Scottish sites made famous by the TV phenomenon.The digital audio guide, created by Geotourist in association with the national tourism organisation VisitScotland, allows fans to immerse themselves in the romantic adventure and follow in the footsteps of time-crossed lovers Claire and Jamie.The Outlander Scottish Filming Locations Tour, downloadable free from an app direct to visitorsrsquo smartphones, comes as the TV series s to UK screens for a fth season on Monday, on Amazon Prime.Launched today, it includes landmarks from Seasons One to Four, such as Glen Coe, Doune Castle in Perthshire and Preston Mill near East Linton, East Lothian, with some doubling as locations in France, the US and the Caribbean.Jenni Steele, Film and Creative Industries Manager at VisitScotland, said: ldquoThe Outlander Scottish Filming Locations Tour is a fantastic way for viewers to immerse themselves in the TV show and fall in love with Scotland, just as they fell in love with the story of Claire and Jamie.ldquoWhat better way to spend Valentinersquos Day than to create your own romantic adventure in these unique settings ldquoThe impact of film and TV goes far beyond the production spend.

The shock development is a stark reminder of how brutal politics can be.The suggestion is Mr Javid would not accept having all his special advisers sacked and a combined No  and No  team created in a new economic unit based in Downing Street. In other words, this was a power-grab by the Prime Minister to control the Treasury. Rishi Sunak, Mr Javidrsquos deputy, well-liked by Mr Johnson, has been promoted to the Chancellorship.:No one outside the Downing Street inner sanctum knew what was going to happenIndeed, the speed at which the -year-old former investment banker seized the top Treasury job suggests Mr Javidrsquos departure was well-planned.Last September, his adviser Sonia Khan was infamously escorted by armed police from Downing Street after a confrontation with, yes, Mr Cummings, over her contact with those close to Philip Hammond, the former Remainer Chancellor.

Yet it was clear from the off trouble was brewing in Whitehall.While Mr Cummings was said to be keen to cast off spending constraints with extra cash for the police and the NHS, Mr Javid ndash an orthodox Thatcherite ndash was determined to keep control of the public finances.The rt only deepened when Mr Johnson ed to No  after Decemberrsquos election victory promising to ldquolevel up for northern England, where the Tories had demolished Labourrsquos hitherto impregnable ldquored wall.It played out in press briefings with allies of Mr Cummings coining the nickname for the Treasury chief ldquoChino ndash Chancellor in name only.However, of late it seemed the tide was beginning to turn in Mr Javidrsquos favour.He appeared to have scored a victory over his rival with the announcement that the HS rail link would go ahead ndash a project which Mr Javid publicly backed while Mr Cummings was a longstanding critic.Suggestions brewed up that Mr Cummingsrsquos influence was on the wane with Downing Street briefing it would be a ldquoconventional reshuffle rather than the far more radical Cabinet overhaul Mr Cummings favoured.

Winter is a tough time for wild birds, but as spring approaches, and the weather becomes warmer, we should expect to hear more tweeting in our gardens.The company is asking keen photographers to share their snaps, with a chance to win a gt card for the store. Daniel Bingham, senior pets buyer for Wilko, offered some advice on helping wild birds thrive during the colder season.He said: “Birds feed every day and don’t store energy well, so one or two bad days in cold weather or without food can be very dangerous for them.“Put out a good selection of food in feeders or on tables to attract birds to your garden — things like fat balls are nutritious and high in energy — perfect to help them maintain weight and stay fuelled.“Put some soft food down for the songbirds who can’t reach the feeders. Suet blocks and pellets work particularly well, as they give the birds a great energy boost and plenty of calories.“Don’t forget to provide fresh water. Ponds, puddles and other water sources may freeze over, making them inaccessible to birds. Birds can be timid so you’ll need to be patient build up trust by sharing plenty of treats and you could soon be rewarded with the perfect wild bird shot”.The Wilko wild bird competition runs until March .

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He played in bands in London, rubbing shoulders with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and his jamming buddy, Ritchie Blackmore, who went on to form the legendary rock bands Deep Purple and Rainbow.He even jammed at a party with Cream bassist and vocalist, Jack Bruce.A visit from Screaming Lord Sutch, who wanted him to go to Germany with him as a bass playermade Jim think again about a career in rock music.His first passion was always art, and comic book art was his favourite genre.He declined Lord Sutch’s offer and after a few years ed to his beloved Orkney. Here he continued drawing for TV comics before working for AD. He was then head-hunted by the American giants, DC Comics and Marvel Comics.Sadly, Jim suffered with Parkinson’s Disease for over  years and passed away on December , .Despite the diagnosis he continued drawing, painting and writing original sci-fi stories for many years.This celebration of his le and art is dferent from other recent exhibitions, as it contains his le story, original artwork and artefacts relating to him.It also features many Orkney related pieces, rather than just sci-fi heroes like Judge Dredd and Batman.Local characters from the th century hang alongside paintings showing the story of St Magnus, wartime Hoy and illustrations from books, like The Bard of Ballarat and Willick o’ Pirliebraes.Jim’s we, Wendy, said: “I am delighted that the Orkney Museum is having an exhibition of my late husband Jim’s work.“The fact that a young boy from the small Orkney island of Hoy should become world famous in his chosen field of comic book illustration is an achievement in itself, but there were many other aspects to Jim’s le.“This exhibition gives an insight into his early le in Hoy, as well, as his time in the RAF and the excitement of being in the London music scene during the ‘swinging sixties’.“I think it is a true reflection of the times he lived in and I hope it will interest the folk who see it.”The Orkney Museum is open Monday to Saturday, .am-.pm, .pm-pm.

Since then, using successive budgets, ministers have singled out HIE for deep cuts while increasing support for economic development where in Scotland. On the face of it, this is just centralisation by another name.“The consequences of this ill-judged decision should not be underestimated. With Brexit already posing a real threat to economic development across the region, including here in Orkney, it makes no sense for this SNP government to compound those dficulties by further slashing HIE’s funding.”Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart added: “HIE have shown that locally-based support can make all the dference for rural enterprises. There can be no good reason to backtrack on that principle through cuts to their funding.“The solution to local challenges can’t always be found in the central belt.

He has urged the Scottish Government to take the issue of fly-tipping more seriously, highlighting the environmental and social impacts of the incidents.Speaking later, Mr Halcro Johnston said: “Rural communities, like many across the Highlands and Islands, are particularly vulnerable to the utterly irresponsible and, of course, criminal activity of fly-tipping.“Incidents can cause real distress, as well as serious environmental concerns, for those communities blighted by fly-tipping. And the problem is often compounded when the waste which is dumped is not removed and then attracts even more incidents.“While fly-tipping is often carried out by a small number of offenders, too few of those responsible are being brought to justice. With both Police Scotland and local council budgets squeezed, that undoubtedly impacts on efforts to identy and prosecute offenders, as well as hampering efforts to clean up blighted areas.“The importance of a clean and attractive environment to the health and well-being of local residents is often overlooked. Many are rightly proud of their local communities and are left angry at those who fly-tip, as well as frustrated at efforts to combat it.“The Scottish Government needs to ensure there is a greater emphasis on tacking the scourge of fly-tipping, bringing to book those responsible for it, and making sure Police Scotland and local councils are properly resourced to do so”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In , Tavish Scott and I voted to support the budget.“Since then, however, the SNP has sought to backslide on this commitment and short change the communities in Orkney and Shetland. This year, that amounts to a shortfall of £m.“It is not good enough for SNP Ministers to claim they are open to negotiationthey so brazenly fail to honour the commitments they have made in previous negotiations. What trust can anyone have in the promises they make “Derek Mackay may have had to fall on his sword but the commitments he made to fair ferry funding for the Northern Isles was one made on behalf of the government as a whole. It is one that must now be delivered: no s and no buts.”Ms Wishart added: “The principle of fair ferry funding was not only accepted by this SNP government, it also reflected the will of the parliament.“Any responsible Government budgets for basic leline services needed across the country.

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

However, a letter’s been sent to the family home asking her to “contact a monumental sculptor” to “make this memorial safe”.A family member – who prefers not to be identied – told us about her upset when she opened the letter.“It was a bit of shock, to be honest,” she said. “Everyone can make mistakes, but this is one that could so easily have been avoided with a bit of sensitivity and professionalism. City Hall keeps records of deaths, so obviously nobody bothered to do any cross-checking. And it would be a very simple matter for the workers inspecting the headstones to take a note of who’s in the plot as an extra precaution. Manynot most of the graves in the cemetery are family plots and somebody should have taken that into consideration before this process started. It’s just a lack of thought and care, in my opinion, and it was totally avoidable.“I would ask them now just to do what they can to make sure their process is tightened up to make sure this sort of thing doesn’t happen to any more families. I’m sure it’s happened before and it will certainly happen again unless the system is improved.”Like many local authorities across the north and in Britain, Belfast City Council is in the midst of a memorial inspection programme launched in  after an eight-year-old boy was killed by a falling headstone in Scotland the previous year.In the letter to the local family, the City Hall Director of City Service said while the Council does “not wish to cause any further upset” to bereaved families, it must “make sure” its cemeteries are “safe places” for workers and visitors.In a statement to the Andersonstown News, A Belfast City Council spokeswoman said: “We are sincerely sorry for the upset and hurt caused to the family. As part of our memorial safety inspection started in , we have written to around , deed holders. Some of the information we hold may not have been updated by relatives or family members, hence this administrative error has occurred. We recognise this will have been very upsetting for those receiving the letter and apologise for the error.”But the family member rejected any suggestion that families should be required to update information about their loved ones for the Council. All deaths in the city are legally required to be registered with Belfast City Council, which also holds burial records for the City Cemetery.“The death was registered with City Hall,” she said. “They have the information at their fingertips and that is enough. The simple fact of the matter is that they made no effort to access that information and are just sending out letters willy-nilly to deed-holders, most of whom are going to be older people. It’s very unfair of the Council to try and turn this around like that. This is too sensitive a matter to be treated in such a slipshod manner.”Askedupdating the Council’s records after the statutory death registration process was the responsibility of the deceased’s family, a Council spokeswoman said: “While we make every effort to ensure the information we have is accurate and up to date, which can be challenging given the passage of time, on this occasion details were missed. We will review the process of writing to deed holders to ensure further checks are in place to try to prevent any similar errors or upset for another family.We sincerely apologise for the error.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"familys fitting tribute to danielle","story":"THE family of a Glengormley woman who died just weeks before she was due to begin a new le-extending cystic fibrosis drug have raised over £, in her memory.Danielle McFalldied at Antrim Area Hospital in October after a week in intensive care.She was diagnosed with the disease aged just six weeks and after being diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of  she developed cirrhosis of the liver.Danielle was due to start the new drug, Orkambi, which can improve lung , after a deal was struck with US drug manufacturer Vertex.However, Danielle became ill on October , soon after the announcement was made, and died on October .In her memory, her family decided they wanted to do something and recently held a fundraiser for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust in Cltonville Golf Club.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Danielle’s mother Angela explained: “She fought long and hard all her le and we all really miss her.“We wanted to do something in her memory but had never done anything like this before.“It was a daunting task to organise something from nothing but we sat down and got sponsors who donated vouchers and prizes for a ballot.“As we got closer to the event, we worried more and more about whether it would be a success.“It was a freezing night in January and we were worried that people wouldn’t come out but thanks to a combination of hard work and incredible generosity, we raised far more money than we ever expected to.“We put on a buffet, had great music from DJ Gerry and a ballot draw.“We had vouchers for make-up salons and barbers, loads of drinks hampers, tickets to the Belfast Giants and the Game of Thrones Giant’s Causeway tour and the main prize, which was a gigantic perfume and make-up hamper from Medicare in Northcott.”Danielle’s family managed to raise an amazing £. for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and Belfast International Airport have pledged an additional £ to the total raised.“It was a really fun-filled night and as a family, we would like to thank all who helped make it possible.“We’re overwhelmed by the result and are glad that out efforts paid off as fantastically as they did.

It#s after Downing Street confirmed earlier this week ministers would report to Prime Minister Boris Johnson after a feasibility study had been carried out on the idea, which has appeared in ious guises over the years. Mr Johnson has said work is under way to assess the feasibility of a bridge between Portpatrick and Larne - estimated to cost £ billion.The revelation has promoted the SDLP#s Mallon to write to the Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps in tandem with her counterpart in Scotland, the SNP#s Michael Matheson. The Scottish Transport Secretary has called for urgent talks over the proposals, which he labelled the Prime Minister#s vanity project. Ms Mallon said she#s surprised such an announcement was made without discussion with her department, given that transport is a devolved matter. I want to make it clear that a lack of investment by successive British Governments has,for a number of years, restricted the necessary investment in vital infrastructure and public transport here, she said in the letter. Infrastructure investment should be focused on projects that will improve lives, boost connectivity and our economy, enhance our communities and work to address the climate crisis.She asked for clarity on what exactly is being proposed by government ministers and for an explanation as to why ministers and officials in Northern Ireland had not been consulted in advance of the announcement. I am extremely concerned that pursuit of this project, costing £ billion,will be a waste of signicant money and resource that could be put to better use by addressing pressures and deliverable projects here in Northern Ireland and where.In his letter, MSP Mr Matheson said rather than indulging the prime minister, funding should be made available to the Northern Ireland and Scotland governments to meet the priorities of the people they serve. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also reiterated this call. Mr Matheson requested immediate discussions with officials to discuss the release of the £bn identied for the project. He also raised concern about a reported munitions dump at Beaufort#s Dyke in the Irish Sea, on the path of construction for the proposed bridge, saying money spent to work around the problem could be put to better use on practical, deliverable projects.The Department for Transport has been asked for a response.

News of the popular secretary of state#s sacking was met with shock and dismay across Northern Ireland on Thursday. Mr Smith was replaced by former Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis. The Times has revealed that the blow will be cushioned as Mr Smith is set to receive a payoff of £, after just  days in the role. Former Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers was given the same amount after being sacked as Environment Secretary. Karen Bradley received a similar payoff upon leaving the Northern Ireland Officein July .The Belfastattempted to find out exactly how much Mrs Bradley had been paid through a Freedom of Information request to the NIO.In response the NIO said that they had the information, but were declining to release it because they did not believe it was in the public interest.It will be published in future as part of the NIO#s annual report and accounts. In this case, I have concluded that the public interest favours withholding the information, the NIO said.The NIO#s   Annual Report and Accounts show that James Brokenshire was given £, when he resigned as NI Secretary due to health reasons in January .Shailesh Vara was awarded £, when he resigned as Minister of State for Northern Ireland in January , the accounts show.He left the Cabinet due to a disagreement over Theresa May#s Brexit withdrawal agreement. Former Conservative leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom was also awarded just short of £, after being sacked as Business Secretary on Thursday, and marked the occasion by taking her staff to London#s Goring Hotel for a champagne lunch.Former Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is entitled to a £, payout after being relieved from his role, which came with the highest yearly salary in the Cabinet, £,.A Cabinet Office spokesperson told the Belfastthat under the terms of the Ministerial and other Pensions and Salaries Act  , all Ministers under the age of  who leave the Government and are not appointed to a new Ministerial position within three weeks are entitled to severance paymentsRelevant departments# severance payments to Ministers are set out in their Annual Report and Accounts, the spokesperson said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis leaves  Downing Street during the reshuffleAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis leaves  Downing Street during the reshuffleMeanwhile, incoming Secretary of State Mr Lewis has wasted no time in getting to grips with his new role.

Sinn Fein vice-president Ms O#Neill said that she agreed to hold an urgent early meeting with Mr Lewis to discuss a range of issues, including legacy, bad faith on pensions, Brexit and political and financial commitments to make the Assembly and Executive sustainable. Mr Coveney said he had a very positive first call with Mr Lewis.Looking forward to working with Brandon Lewis for as long as I hold my role in Government, he said.Northern Ireland deserves and needs a strong and positive relationship with UK and Irish Governments.

Michelle O#Neill said she would be raising legacy issues with Mr Lewis at their meeting today.Reports from London that Julian Smith was sacked as a result of commitments made to bring forward legislation to implement the legacy bodies agreed at Stormont House are very concerning for victims of the conflict and their families, she said.The British government has already dragged this process out for more than five years, delaying the publication of legislation again and again.Some victims have been waiting up to five decades for truth and disclosure. It is unacceptable for the British government to backtrack on commitments made only weeks ago in the New Decade New Approach agreement.The British government must honour its agreements regardless of who is in the office of British Secretary of State.Arlene Foster said she would raise the key challenges Mr Lewis is facing with him.We want to get Northern Ireland moving forward again. The Secretary of State has a key role in that process, she said. Mr Lewis will need to step up to the mark and show his commitment to the implementation of the New Decade New Approach deal and that he will be a positive voice for Northern Ireland at the cabinet table. Whether it is our hospitals or schools or infrastructure such as broadband, we need to work hand in glove with Her Majesty#s Government to achieve the right outcomes. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: There are many challenges facing the Secretary of State and I hope he acts with fairness and integrity in dealing with the Executive at Stormont and on issues relating to the past.Mr Eastwood said he looked forward to meeting Mr Lewis in the coming weeks.UUP leader Steve Aiken said Mr Lewis faced a massive in-tray and couldn#t let the grass grow under his feet. He said: I#ll be asking the new Secretary of State to stand up for Northern Ireland and, even at this late stage, push back hard against the worst excesses of the Withdrawal Agreement which will impose a border in the Irish Sea. I hope that he#ll show some mettle in cabinet and not be afraid to speak up against any further moves that undermine the integrity of the Union.It looks like we#ll have an Irish government actively campaigning against the Union so it#s long past time that our own Government got off the fence and started actively campaigning for the Union. TUV leader Jim Allister said that with Sinn Fein poised to enter government in the Republic, it was vital that the new Secretary of State adopted a robust pro-Union position.He said there must be ato government policy that Dublin has no say in the internal affairs of Northern Ireland.Politicians from across the ide united to pay tribute to Julian Smith after Boris Johnson#s reshuffle. Concerns were expressed about the effect on Stormont#s fragile institutions.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar hailed him as one of Britain#s finest politicians of our time.Mr Varadkar said: In eight months as Secretary of State, Julian you helped to restore powersharing in Stormont, secured an agreement with us to avoid a hard border, plus marriage equality. You are one of Britain#s finest politicians of our time. Thank you.Mrs Foster praised the outgoing Secretary of State for his incredible dedication. Spoke with Julian Smith a short time ago to thank him for his help in getting devolution restored, she tweeted. We may not have always agreedbut his dedication to the role was incredible. Best wishes to him and his family. Always welcome in Fermanagh.Mr Eastwood had harsh words for the Prime Minister, calling the sacking a strategic error by the Tory leader.

February , Gillian HallidayFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Duchess of Cambridge charmed both visitors and animals alike during a guided tour of an open farm in Co Down in what was her first solo visit to Northern Ireland on Wednesday.Kate - known as Lady Carrickfergus when in Northern Ireland - was on a day visit to one of our most popular family attractions, Ark Open Farm in Newtownards, which attracts , visitors each year.Despite the chilly weather conditions, it was a warm welcome for the royal, who was dressed perfectly for the farm visit in a Barbour jacket and Penelope Chilvers knee boots.During her flying visit, the mother of three met with local representatives of the Early Years organisation and families who have benefited from the work of the charity.It aims to support expectant parents, mums and dads, and carers of children up to five years old.While chatting with parents, the -year-old also found time to interact with the farm animals, helping little Newtownards girl Jane Thompsonbottle-feed a lamb.Her mother Nicolatold the Belfastthat her daughter was delighted to meet the princess. It was really nice. She#s just very natural with the kids, she explained.We#re here today because Jane goes to Glenbrooke Nursery which was one of the nurseries invited to come along here.The Duchess also met with the Ark#s more exotic residents, an alpaca and a corn snake called Sophie.The Duchess of Cambridge was in Northern Ireland for a visit of Ark Open Farm in Newtownards.Kate expressed amazement as she held the pale yellow reptile, confessing it was the first time she had picked one up, offering a child next to her the opportunity to also touch the snake.She#s got the most amazing skin. This is the first time I#ve ever held a snake like that. How cool is that  she explained.It appears the royal may have had somewhat of a fear of the species, as Ark owner Stewart Donaldson joked that he had been informed beforehand that Kate wasn#t particularly keen on meeting Sophie.He told this newspaper that he was delighted to welcome the royal visitor to the farm in what is a very special year for the attraction, which he runs with his we Lorraine, daughter Lyndy, and son-in-law Stuart.It#s our th anniversary. We#re all very excited. It was quite a job keeping her visit secret.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality.

The group are calling for participants to take part in the recording, which will take place from Monday th to Thursday th February from am to pm each day. Former shirt factory workers will gather in groups of four in the Inner City Trust on Bishop Street, recording one hour sessions per group. There will be sixteen sessions recorded over the four days, with the audio pulled together into one podcast of memories, laughter and catching up. Also, on Friday, February , from am to pm there will be a sing-a-long session in the Guildhall’s Whittaker Suite, led by Roy Arbuckle, where a group of  participants will join together to perform some of the old time favourites that the workers would have sung in the shirt factories. googletag.cmd.push This session will also be recorded and used as part of the podcast series. Ruth McPhillips, Museum Events and Engagement Officer, said that the podcast will be a perfect opportunity to build on the legacy of the factory workers, which included the highly successful recent Herstory event. “Through the podcast, the Tower Museum and Inner City Trust will build on foundations already laid in celebrating the great traditions of the shirt factory industry in Derry and throughout the District and, in particular, the ladies who have been the backbone of our society for many years,” Ruth said. “This project is a small tribute to the generations of factory workers who spent their lives on the factory floor - putting the world to rights, banging on the bars, making the toast – and making history! googletag.cmd.push “We are celebrating this iconic, ground-breaking industry, sharing in the stories and documenting the memories for generations to come. “We are looking to speak to people who have stories and memories from their shirt factory days. Whilst the first episode will be aired on International Women’s Day, which will take place on Sunday th March, we are keen to speak to both men and women who worked in the shirt factories.” Helen Quigley, Inner City Trust, said preserving the stories of the factory workers is extremely important. “We are delighted to be working in collaboration with Derry  Strabane District Council to deliver the International Women’s Day : Factory Girls Podcast. “This will act as a tribute to the generations of factory girlswho over the years contributed so much to the city’s economy and could truly be said to have built a great sense of community,” Helen said. “Factory girls were the backbone of the city. Not only did they signicantly contribute to the wider local economy, they were often the sole breadwinners in the family. “Lelong relationships were forged on the factory floor that endured over the years and beyond the walls of the factories. It was not unusual for grandmothers, mothers and daughters of the same families to continue the shirt factory tradition. “It is no exaggeration to say that they held the city together in bleak economic times, providing stability and protection for their families and the wider community. “I’m delighted that we are able to help preserve these stories and memories through the use of the podcasting facilities at the Garden of Reflection.” To register your interest in taking part in the interviews and conversations sessions, please email ruth.mcphillips@derrystrabane. com or call    . Please note, Monday and Tuesdays sessions have been filled. If you would only like to take part in the sing-a-long session, you can email tower.reception@derrystrabane. com, call into the Tower Museum or ring    .

A quick look at McCormacks CV shows that he is not about comfort, he is about winning – two league titles, one FAI Cup, one League Cup, two Setanta Cups, three Presidents Cups and three Leinster Senior Cups. He has played in Europe on countless occasions and brings the kind of experience that every ambitious team craves. He has played with St. Patricks Athletic, Shamrock Rovers and Cork City and won trophies with them all. The only team he has not tasted success with is Derry City, which could well be one of the reasons behind histo the club. googletag.cmd.push Whatever his motivation, he has been determined to get in shape for this new season, those long and lonely runs around the two bridges just one mark of the attitude which convinced Declan Devine to make him his new captain.“People say that Conor has been at this club in the past but then left but you have to understand that the appetite that he has shown since coming back to the club,” he explained. “Conor was looking from the outside in last year and one of the things that he said to me was that he looked and felt what we were doing. He saw the crowds that were coming to the Brandywell and the togetherness of the players and the supporters in really rallying the club last year. He said from day dot that he really wanted to be a part of it. “Conor loves this football club and he has a great feeling for it. His application to training has been magnicent, but more than that, I think hell be a player on the pitch that can spit a bit of fire, he has that aggression, but he will also have that calming influence which he has gained in his career. He can also show our young players, and we have a lot of young players again this year, what it takes to win football matches in the League of Ireland.” googletag.cmd.push PrivilegeMcCormack replaces Barry McNamee as the man in charge on the field, both midfielders but dferent players altogether. Whilst McNamee was filled with craft, McCormack is filled with determination, and he is ready to lead by example. “Im absolutely delighted,” he said. “Its a privilege and Im very proud to be captain of this great club. “Were just going to take every game as it is. We have a lot of games, a lot of cup competitions and we have Europe to look forward to as well but were not going to look too far ahead and were just going to take each game as it comes and hopefully we can take three points as much as we can.”Nine new players have come in the door and the new level of competition is good for everyone insists the captain.“It is healthy,” he continued. “You can see that in training that everyone is biting at the bullet and everyone wants to be in the first eleven come the first game of the season. Training has been really intense and been really good and its good for everyone because it pushes everyone. You cant underperform and you have to be at your best even in training and thats what Declan and the staff demands. As a player I try and demand that off myself and I demand it off other players as well.”Dundalk await, the champions against a team with lofty ambitions themselves. It is a mouth-watering game for everyone on day one of the new season. “In the last four or five weeks we have trained together really hard,” McCormack stated. “We were away there for a couple of days as well up in Dunboyne and there were fantastic facilities. All the lads bonded and gelled well together so hopefully then some the start of the season we can gel well for each game. We cant wait now to get started. Theres been a lot of hard work out into it and hopefully we can put that into place and hopefully come Friday night we can get a god result.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mallon is determined to make an impact similar to friend David Parkhouse and he has used pre-season to ensure that he hits the ground running, starting tomorrow night. “Its a massive game, not only is it the opener but its last years champions,” he said. “We have done a bit of preparation towards it but I think the main focus is on us and how were going to play, what were going to do and how were going to break them down. We just really impose ourselves on the game and we cant wait for it. “I feel very good. Its nice to get out there and get minutes playing for Derry. There has been some tough games but good games and its been a good chance for us to showcase ourselves and try and get in that starting eleven for the game at Dundalk.”This will be Mallons first experience of the League of Ireland, but having spoken extensively to Parkhouse before he made the move to the Brandywell, he is not at all surprised by the quality of his team mates as he prepares for the next chapter of what he hopes will be a long and successful career.“Im not surprised because I was expecting very good players,” he continued. “We have got a very good group we have a mixture of experienced players and young lads who have some real talent and who want to go on and prove themselves in this league. I think we have a very strong squad and that we will do very well this year.” googletag.cmd.push New look squadDerry City have ten new players in since the end of last season and looking around at the squad, Mallon believes that City are in very good shape ahead of what promises to be a demanding campaign.“Healthy competition is always good,” he insisted. “Everyone wants to do well and everyone knows what direction we want to go in. Everyone is working for the same end prize and its good to have that competition because during the season some players are going to have a dip in form, and injuries so it is good to have quality in every position.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But I am committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland.ldquoI will be assessing the pressures across my department reflecting on my priorities, the commitments in the lsquoNew Decade: New Approachrsquo document and the budget made available for the period ahead.Ms Mallon said that as a result, it is therefore ldquotoo early to comment on specic schemes such as the Ballynahinch bypass.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.During last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, there was across-the-board political support for a motion seeking a meeting with Ms Mallon and seniors roads engineers to discuss the Ballynahinch scheme.It was tabled by Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is keen to see work starting on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads.He said the scheme has been shovel ready for some time and is hoping the Department for Infrastructure will allocate funding to allow construction work, which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete, to begin.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.He added: ldquoThe time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding. I have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason described Ballynahinch as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.

Local authority officials hope that work on the much-needed project can start within four years.News of the new leisure centre plan, exclusively revealed in the Recorder last October, is being discussed by senior council officials and local politicians and recently topped the agenda during a special workshop examining the way forward.Among the proposals being examined are building a new complex at the rear of the current Newcastle Centre, which enjoys protected status. This would also result in the current outdoor Tropicana swimming pool being bulldozed.Local politicians were recently presented with an update on progress on a new leisure proposal, with council officials confirming this week that a review of ious feasibility studies and their findings is being considered by the organisation.While the local authority said that it is not yet in a position to confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or indeed the Tropicana, it insists any new-build will not encroach on the promenade at the rear.Most signicantly, the council has confirmed that any commissioning of a full economic appraisal and business case would involve consultations, including public meetings, as part of the process.Council officials say that they are ldquoacutely aware of the need for improved leisure provision in Newcastle and are keen to address criticism that on wet days in the resort, there is little provision for both residents and tourists.While redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre, which forms part of the Annesley Buildings, is one option moving forward, there are suggestions that given the age of the building, the scale of the work involved an the constraints of the site, a new-build at the rear would be more most cost-effective.One of the key issues the council will have to address is how it intends to replace the Tropicana , as widely expected, it will be bulldozed. There are those pushing for an indoor water facility which would be available all year round.Council officials are also keen to ensure that the redevelopment of the Main Street site is in keeping with a part of the resort where millions of pounds have been invested over recent years. Serious consideration will also have to be given to on-site car parking, included adequate disabled provision.In addition, council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl to develop a new store and dedicated base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Councillors are keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure that Newcastle boasts an ultra-modern community and leisure facility.They say that the provision of a new centre for residents and visitors is long overdue and that a resort the size of Newcastle should and must have adequate leisure provision. Some councillors are keen to see a family fun pool in the proposed new-build.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed that several feasibility studies and strategic reports have been compiled in relation to the Newcastle Centre.She also confirmed that a recent review of the feasibility studies and their findings has been completed and is being considered by the local authority.ldquoUntil further scoping works are carried out, the council cannot confirm any plans or timelines in relation to the Newcastle Centre or the Tropicana, said the spokeswoman.She added: ldquoHowever, encroaching on to the promenade is not anticipated.

I do it to keep me fit and healthy. That’s it.”When I spoke with Ken last week he had just finished his training for the day: “No running for me today, I went swimming instead. Only for  minutes, but it’s enough to get all the joints working.“I try to keep active almost every day, but the weather around here is often horrible, so I can’t always be outdoors.”Ken’s London Marathon medal haul.

What happens when you’re old, you fall over, you do all sorts of things, so the marathon people have agreed to let her be there with me. I’m going to be lucky this year to finish, but I’ll give it my best.”Londoner Ken said he considered himself to be an honorary Irishman: “I feel absolutely at home in Northern Ireland. I would never go back to England. My we brought me over here in  to meet her parents. “My grandparents were Irish and my mother, with the name of Catherine Winred O’Rourke – that couldn’t be more Irish, could it “I married an Irish girl – Nora Kelly, she comes from a village called Convoy in Donegal – so I’m % Irish now.”Explaining how he met his we, Ken said: “We first met in an Irish dance hall in London. I liked doing the Siege of Ennis – it’s a dance where you twirl around in a circle.“In  we got married. We’ve been married over  years. We still get on alright.“We’d be over to see Nora’s parents in Donegal at least every six months and they would come over to us in London. “My sister-in-law talked me into moving here in . I kept coming over and I really liked the place – the people are lovely, it’s nice and quiet, there’s cows in the fields in summer and in winter there’s sheep in the fields.

We go off walking five or six miles together, chatting. “We get on ever so well, he’s a young guy, he must be about . Any problems I’ve got he seems to solve them for me. He never has any problems.“I’ve got another neighbour down the road who helps too, with things in the garden and the like.”Ken, who has been a member of the the London-based Orion Harriers club for  years, was involved in some marathon pre-publicity last week along with the other remaining nine members of the Ever Presents club who have run all the London Marathons since .He said: “They had us up at Marathon House in London. There were so many cameras snapping and filming, I think every television company was there. We gave loads of interviews, all the guys.“In the evening they took us up to Tower Bridge where we were interviewed by the BBC. Last of all they called me up and said, ‘now we’ve got the famous Ken Jones’.

All my running mates say, ‘you’ve got to do it’, but I’m saying that this is the last time.  is a good number to stop at.”In terms of fundraising for the marathon Ken has taken a unique approach in recent years: “I used to raise money for Foyle Hospice, but I found I couldn’t keep going back to the same people every year asking for money. So what I do is I set aside a couple of hundred pounds and give it to the other runners. I’ve about £ to encourage runners to go and get an entry form because you do have to raise a lot of money to run these marathons.”\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers. This included The Bottle Shop and Loursquos for Men, who each sponsored one family for the six-week duration of the scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world.

What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: \"The Historical Environments Division is a section of the Department for Communities whose responsibility is to protect historical sites in Northern Ireland and therefore safeguard our heritage.In respect to Knock Iveagh on the outskirts of Rathfriland - a prehistoric burial site date back to  years BC and the site where the inauguration of medieval Irish Kings took place - the HED has failed and they have failed miserably. In fact had it not been for the ‘Friends of Knock Iveagh’, a public interest group, this Neolithic site would have destroyed by development that should never have been allowed.\"Having asked written questions of both the Ministers for the Communities and Infrastructure it is clear that their failing from  has led us to a situation where they have now passed the issue onto Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough council planners.\"This has put the local government planners in a dficult position. If they were to apply enforcement orders on the developers on Knock Iveagh, the ones that were given permission to develop by the Department for Infrastructure and were not stopped by the Department for the Communities, then there may be a massive compensation or legal cost for such action and that will be passed to the rate payers of the local council area. \"How can it be fair that the rate payers of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon could pick up the cost of the failings by DfC and DfI.\"It is time that both DfI and DfC - who have the powers to put Knock Iveagh back to the way it was before they mistakenly gave authority for a wind turbine development - to step up and take the financial responsibility for their mistakes. The government sponsored vandalism of a site scheduled for protection under the Historical and Archaeological Objects Order is a disgrace but allowing local council to pick up the cost compounds the damage started in  and should not be acceptable.\"A Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: “Councils are responsible for the proper administration and lawful processing of their own planning and or enforcement cases. The Department recognises the concerns and strength of feeling but, under the Transition Provisions for the transfer of the majority of planning s to the new Councils in April , responsibility for planning application permission does now lie with the Council. “The planning and enforcement issues in what is a highly complex case are also a matter for the Council. “A spokesperson for ABC Council said: “The Council is currently considering a number of Planning matters in relation to the site at Knockiveagh including requests to revoke discontinue planning permission for the wind turbine.“All of these planning matters remain under consideration at the present time,” said the spokesperson.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_2743935.jpg--.jpg?1581604995000\\","title":"no one located after multi agency search of strule river ","story":"Police received a report of a concern for safety in the Drumragh Avenue area of Omagh in the early hours of this morning .

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
