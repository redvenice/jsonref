Guns and liquor were banned and cellphone signals were jammed in parts of Manila.Devotees who were pushed back when they tried to touch the statue complained, but despite the security and the tropical heat, mobs of people dangerously squeezed into a tight pack of humanity around the carriage. They threw small towels at volunteers on the carriage for them to wipe parts of the statue and toss the towels back, believing the Nazarene\u0027s powers can cure ailments and do other miracles.Dozens of people fainted or sustained injuries and were carried away on stretchers by Red Cross volunteers.Jocelyn del Rosario, a 55-year-old restaurant manager, said she walked barefoot for more than 4 kilometers (2.6 miles) on an empty stomach to show her devotion to the Black Nazarene and pray for her children.

Some believe the statue\u0027s endurance, from fires and earthquakes through the centuries and intense bombings during World War II, is a testament to its powers.The spectacle reflects the unique brand of Catholicism, which includes folk superstitions, in Asia\u0027s largest Catholic nation. Dozens of Filipinos have themselves nailed to crosses on Good Friday in another tradition that draws huge crowds and tourists each year.Such religious passion has continued in the Philippines even as President Rodrigo Duterte has stepped up attacks in recent years on the church and bishops, who have criticized the thousands of killings under his anti-drug crackdown. Duterte sparked outrage among many Catholics two years ago when he called God \u0027stupid\u0027 and later questioned the basic tenets of the faith.

Lots of towns and villages host winter festivals and parades one of the biggest is the Festivalul de Datini și Obiceiuri Strămoșești (the festival of customs and ancestors’ customs) in Comănești on 30 December. Different groups come from miles around to participate, and it has become best known for its bear dancers: groups who process through the streets in bear costumes, often made from real animal furs, some as much as 50 years old.The bear was a sacred animal in ancient Romania. It’s thought that the tradition of dancing bears originated many centuries ago among the Roma who would visit villages just before New Year with real bears on leashes to dance and chase away bad spirits from the outgoing year. When the country was under communist rule, it was banned bear dancing was made illegal in 1998 and, when Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU in 2007, the last of the dancing bears were bought from their owners and “retired” to a bear reserve in the Rila mountains.As well as the “bears” in Comănești’s festival, each group will also have someone playing the “Gypsy” andor “The Bear Tamer”, plus musicians with drums and panpipes. Everyone dances and sings as they go through the streets, making their way to a stage where they act out a simple ritual scene in which the bear collapses because a demon is inside him. The Gypsy comes with a knife and bleeds the bear, lets the demon out and the bear revives. It’s a story of rebirth for the new year. In some versions of the tradition, the bear, the Gypsy and the drummers also go from house to house in the village, singing and dancing to ward off evil and bring good luck.I didn’t go to the festival as a child. Photography has helped me discover my country in a fuller way. I live in the UK now but have been to Comănești and the region five times over the past decade to photograph the festivals. This shot was from 2013. It’s mostly men and boys who dress up in the bear skins, but I have seen girls, too. The boy is wearing a real bear skin that would have been very old and very heavy – some of them weigh up to 50kg - and also very hot.It’s really hard to shoot a procession. You can either sprint ahead and wait for the group, or walk backwards in front of them. I prefer that way, but you can’t then see where you’re going and I’m always praying I’m not going to step on something or trip.I’d spotted this boy earlier – sometimes the dancers take the masks off because they get too hot – and was struck by something about his expression. There are lots of photographers at the event, so the boy knew I was shooting him but didn’t take any notice of me. He was flushed because he’d been dancing and running all day, and there was this one moment when he was looking in my direction. I didn’t realise at the time I’d got such a good shot.When I photograph, I’m always so immersed in what I’m doing that I don’t stop to consider what I’ve taken. I just try to get as many shots as possible – if you stop you risk missing things. You never know what’s round the corner. When I look at the photo now, the only thing I regret is the lack of snow. There’s usually snow on the ground at the time, but climate change is affecting Romania’s weather like everywhere else, and the snow often comes in March rather than DecemberJanuary.This picture has changed my life. It won a National Geographic Traveller UK competition. Part of my prize was a trip to the Maasai Mara, where I’d always dreamed of going. It has brought me international recognition and commissions, and has also helped make the festival famous all over the world. It’s even live on Facebook these days. I heard about someone coming from Japan to see it. Last year, I met the mayor of Comănești, and to my amazement he gave me a big hug!I’m fascinated by traditions and costumes. In a costume you can be something other than yourself. In recent visits to the region’s winter festivals, I’ve also focused on a portraiture series, asking people in their colourful costumes to pose for me in front of a mobile studio. I came across one bear costume made entirely of reeds that weighed 100kg. Other costumes (there can be horses, deer and goats as well as bears) are made of rags or paper, while some people paint their faces or wear really elaborate masks or pointed hats that are a metre high.Many Romanians who work abroad return each year specifically to take part in the winter festivals – it’s how they express and celebrate their cultural identity. There’s always an amazing vibe in Comănești. I dance, too – you feel so much energy. Whenever I photograph, whatever my subject, I try to bring a good energy to it, but here it was easy.• See more images at Alecsandra Raluca Drăgoi’s website.Trained: BA in photography, Portsmouth University MA in documentary photography and photojournalism, Westminster University.High point: “Winning the Sony awards’ youth category in 2013 and National Geographic Traveller UK in 2015.

Ikea owns 44 malls worldwide but has built these itself, rather than buying up existing centres.In October, Ikea said it had bumped up its property team in the UK with the aim of capitalising on the decreased valuations of many shopping centres prompted by numerous closures of high street chain stores.The company is thought to be looking at further shopping sites across the UK as a way to get its hands on sites for its smaller, more accessible stores in city centre locations.It is unlikely to face much competition for targets from institutional investors, which are shying away from the retail sector in the face of the rapidly changing market and declining values.Thousands of high street jobs have been lost this year as a result of high profile retail administrations and thousands more are at risk as Mothercare, Debenhams and Forever 21 prepare for closures.

More of our customers are living in cities than ever before and a regenerated Kings Mall will be an ideal location for reaching millions of Londoners.”The retailer opened its first city centre site in the UK on central London’s Tottenham Court Road in 2018 and has since opened another in Bromley, south-east London.Both those sites are “planning studios” that enable shoppers to get advice on kitchen and bathroom overhauls.

This conservative spending behaviour showed up in Tesco’s non-food aisles, with weak sales of clothing, homewares and toys putting a drag on the retailer’s overall performance. On Wednesday, Sainsbury’s said poor sales of toys and video games had dented the performance of its Argos chain.The Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said: “The peak Christmas trading period in the UK has been a bit of a slog for the major grocers.

For him, that means no more struggling to conform to a role about which he has been ambivalent since childhood, to the point at times of threatening his mental health. For her, it’s a break from the hostility of the British press and the pressure to become an old-fashioned wife with no opinions of her own, plus the chance to raise baby Archie partly in north America.If Buckingham Palace has responded with the barely stifled horror of a pushy parent whose son drops out of university to become a professional YouTuber, that’s in part because all this exposes an intergenerational clash of values with which many modern families are struggling. An older generation with a stiff-backed sense of duty, appalled by what they see as the grandchildren’s navel-gazing pursuit of self-fulfilment and emotional meaning at work, is finding it hard to come to terms with change. But the couple’s ambition to become “financially independent”, rather than relying on the taxpayer, while still keeping one foot in royal life raises practical questions that are harder to dismiss. How, exactly, are they planning to make that kind of money without dragging the head of state through some dubious commercial mud?Royal memories of past attempts at entrepreneurship are still very raw. The Countess of Wessex, married to Prince Edward, was forced to resign from her PR firm when an undercover reporter from the News of the World, posing as a potential client, taped her gossiping indiscreetly about Prince Charles and Tony Blair. And nobody wants to be reminded of Prince Andrew’s disastrous entanglement with the billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There’s talk of the Sussexes leveraging their unique mix of royalty and Hollywood celebrity to become globetrotting ambassadors with a social conscience, a bit like George and Amal Clooney or the post-presidency Obamas – backed perhaps by their own charitable foundation. But foundations drink money and it’s not easy finding billionaires with spotless ethical records, willing to donate for strictly altruistic reasons rather than in the hopes of cashing in on the royal connection.Perhaps the Duchess could go back to acting, but the harsh reality is she will inevitably be cast less because she was once in the television show Suits than for the publicity value of having a real-life royal on set. And if there are downsides to all these projects for the breakaway couple, it’s even harder to discern what’s in it for the rest of the monarchy beyond extra ribbon-cutting duties and an alarming sense of being left behind.For, like all soap operas, the royal fairytale thrives on romance, glamorous dresses and babies it needs its younger cast members to keep the punters hooked and Meghan, in particular, had captured the imagination of a generation not otherwise very invested in the royals. Without her, the future of the franchise looks decidedly rockier, with everything resting on the steadier but less exciting Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. No wonder that palace statement talked of “complicated” issues in need of ironing out, and of talks being at an early stage. However gilded their cage, it seems unfair to keep the Sussexes in captivity for ever. But it may be more painful than it looks for the Queen to let them loose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88ed1ab173a3986c1fef761e1735f6b176eea93c/0_487_7234_4341/master/7234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a51b219841b6cbf0f2db397aa07daef","title":"arctic treasures melting ice british museum","story":"Items made from 28,000-year-old mammoth tusks among artefacts at British MuseumRare 28,000-year-old archaeological finds excavated from rapidly thawing ground in Siberia are to go on display for the first time at the British Museum as part of an exhibition on the history of the Arctic and its people.Sewing needles and jewellery made from walrus ivory as well as carved mammoth ivory decorative objects are being lent by the Russian Academy of Science for a show that will be the biggest of its kind.Jago Cooper, the head of the Americas collections at the museum, said the archeological site in north-east Siberia was a remarkable treasure trove, but it is also a tragedy because the objects are only now emerging due to the climate emergency.“As the Arctic is melting, the permafrost, the frozen ground, is melting as well. The things that people were living with in that landscape, which are incredibly well-preserved in that frozen ground, are coming out as the ground is melting.“It’s like the library of Alexandria being on fire ... You’re plucking out these books which are coming out … it’s a remarkable window into life, all coming out of the ground in one go.”The loans will be part of an exhibition exploring the history of the region where 4 million people still live, including 400,000 indigenous people. It will be told through the lens of weather and the climate crisis, with scientists predicting that the Arctic will be ice-free in 80 years.Objects from the Yana Rhinoceros Horn archaeological site in Siberia, 300 miles (480km) north of the Arctic circle, are particular highlights. It was there, 30,000 years ago, that Palaeolithic people hunted woolly mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, bison and giant horses. They also developed the first Arctic art.Amber Lincoln, a co-curator of the show, said the needles were an important example of Arctic innovation and would have been threaded and used to create tailored garments. “Think about that, these small needles 28,000 years ago … it kind of just gives me the chills, frankly.”Part of the exhibition will explore the social, economic and political changes Arctic people have faced as a result of European and Russian exploration of the region, including the quest for the Northwest Passage and the global fur trade.A key object will be an Inughuit (Greenlandic) sled made from narwhal and caribou bone and driftwood. It was traded to the British polar explorer Sir John Ross in his 1818 expedition, the first known encounter between Inughuit and Europeans.Curators said there would also be a number of new artworks commissioned as well as contemporary photography by the likes of Kiliii Yuyan among others.Staging a show so heavily freighted with issues around the climate emergency has inevitably raised questions around the British Museum’s relationship with one of its biggest sponsors, BP.The Arctic show’s main sponsor will be Citibank. Chris Garrard, the co-director of the campaign group Culture Unstained, accused the museum of “cynically” keeping BP’s logo away from the exhibition.Hartwig Fischer, the director of the British Museum, denied a charge of hypocrisy. “I don’t think it’s contradictory,” he said. “We are all exposed to the challenges and have to think together, how to find the right solution, to mitigate the effects of these changes. We have all contributed to these changes living as citizens of the Earth, in one way or another.“It is all of us consuming fossil fuels and those who produce it … you cannot separate one from the other. We have to think together about what changes are necessary.”• Arctic: culture and climate is at the British Museum from 28 May until 23 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069377452b5a94f708aedf8b5c9d901a02dc4841/0_193_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0b64cb63b59cff218ce844503354ab9","title":"ofsted to bring back routine inspections for outstanding schools","story":"DfE returns to policy of five-yearly visits by the regulator for outstanding schoolsOutstanding schools and colleges in England are to be stripped of their exemption from regular inspections, overturning a policy introduced by the former education secretary Michael Gove.The Department for Education said that from September it plans to return to a five-year cycle of inspections for state schools rated by Ofsted as outstanding , fulfilling an election promise by the Conservatives and an earlier pledge by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson.Since 2012, schools with an outstanding rating have been exempt from routine inspection. But some schools have not been inspected by Ofsted for a decade, with Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, concerned at the lack of oversight.Around 3,700 state schools in England will be affected by the rule change, which the DfE said underlined the government’s view that school inspection “serves a vital purpose” in improving standards.“Parents want to know that they are making the best, most informed choices about their children’s education. Making sure that all schools are regularly inspected means they will benefit from the expert insight Ofsted provides when making these decisions,” said Williamson.“We know parents trust Ofsted – and with good reason. It serves a valuable purpose as the only organisation that gives a clear, accessible and impartial view on school and college performance.“But it’s also far more than that – it’s a driver of improvement. Although we continue to trust our best schools and colleges to get on with the job of educating, without Ofsted standards would go unchecked and the exemption meant there is often not an up-to-date picture.”The changes are subject to a formal consultation launched by the DfE, with the proposals subject to parliamentary approval. The DfE said the schools that have gone the longest without inspection will be Ofsted’s top priority.During last year’s election campaign the Conservatives also pledged to make all Ofsted inspections no-notice, as well as extending the length of full inspections from two to three days, with the extra time used to examine “behaviour, bullying and a school’s extracurricular offer,” including sport.Duncan Baldwin, deputy director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents many secondary school heads, said the union supported the change.“The policy of exempting them from the normal inspection cycle was well-intentioned and safeguards were built into the system in the event of there being concerns at a school or college.“However, it has resulted in parents going too long without the verification of an inspection at a number of schools and colleges, and it is time to reverse the policy,” Baldwin said.Last year the National Audit Office found that hundreds of schools have not been inspected in the past eight years, and nearly 300 had not been inspected for a decade.During the 2018-19 academic year Ofsted upped its inspections of outstanding schools, after a request from ministers. Of the 382 schools inspected, only 63 retained their outstanding rating, while 89 were classed as requiring improvement and 19 were inadequate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/710035d5fdfe2dcb129e2e323a516a8e61c9ea1a/8_641_1655_993/master/1655.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4fa40d67c8b798a4c7af1b617df55d49","title":"david athertons recipe for healthier flapjacks","story":"The 2019 GBBO winner starts his fortnightly column with date-based flapjacks to give you an energy boostFlapjacks used to be my go-to for a sugar hit when doing exercise, but the butter and syrup used traditionally can leave you feeling cheated out of the hard work you are putting in.

The striker, who was hurt in the 1-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day, had been left to expect the worst after scans last Friday revealed a serious tear. He knew that he would not be back until March at the earliest.The reality has proved to be even more shocking – a setback to cast a shadow over Tottenham’s season and, in terms of the England team, far from ideal in the countdown to Euro 2020. Will the captain have the time to recover maximum sharpness before the tournament kicks off? England’s opening tie is against Croatia on 14 June. They play each of their three group ties at Wembley, which is also the venue for the semi-finals and final.Tottenham announced on Thursday that Kane had suffered a ruptured tendon in the hamstring and, after further reviews, had been advised that an operation was the best course of action. It is unclear exactly when in April Kane will return. It might be noted that he has previously shown himself to be a quick healer after injuries.“Following ongoing assessment by our medical staff over the past week, we can confirm that Harry Kane will undergo surgery to repair a ruptured tendon in his left hamstring,” a Tottenham statement read. “The decision to undergo surgery is not expected to impact the timeframe that the England captain will be sidelined, with the expectation that he will return to training in April.”José Mourinho, the Spurs manager, had been prepared to lose Kane for a significant period, saying last Friday that he expected “bad news” and, with no recognised, senior replacement centre-forward in the squad, the club will now push to make a signing in January. They have Milan’s Poland striker, Krzysztof Piatek, on their wishlist.Mourinho is in the midst of an injury crisis, with Moussa Sissoko ruled out until mid-April at the earliest after knee ligament surgery and Hugo Lloris (elbow), Ben Davies (ankle), Danny Rose (muscular) and Tanguy Ndombele (groin) also out.

After six seasons and six trophies, including two FA Cup wins at Wembley and a Women’s Super League title in 2016, he leaves for the men’s MLS team New York City.Not, though, as manager but as No 2 to the newly appointed Norwegian Ronny Deila.Cushing’s departure is not necessarily unexpected, but the timing of it is. There has been a feeling for a while that perhaps he is not the manager to help Manchester City prise the elusive Champions League trophy from Lyon. After consecutive semi-final defeats to the French champions in 2016-17 and 2017-18 City have suffered back-to-back losses to Atlético Madrid, most recently in their last-16 tie in October.While City have stagnated in Europe, though stayed competitive domestically, Chelsea and Arsenal have leapfrogged them somewhat and look the more likely teams to upset Lyon’s domination of Europe.Some wondered whether he might have departed last summer, on the high of a domestic cup double and solid title challenge after a trophyless year the preceding season.He is a highly respected manager. One that is known for an incredible attention to detail in the technical and tactical side of the game and a knack for nurturing young talent.The 22-year-old defensive midfielder Keira Walsh, whom Cushing described as the “most intelligent” player he has ever worked with, recently told the  of his impact. “I just listen to what he says and try to do that on the pitch,” she said. “I see him getting criticism off fans and honestly it’s the most baffling thing. I don’t understand how he gets criticised because if you ask any player at this club they’ll tell you what an unbelievable coach he is.“He’s praised me but I just do what he tells me to do on the pitch and it works, it does for most of the girls. He tells us exactly where we should be in every moment and it’s paid off in trophies. I wish other people would see what an unbelievable coach he is because he deserves more credit.“If you ask players who’ve left they’ll say that tactically he is head and shoulders above most coaches. He just loves football, he watches so much football and so many different teams that he just adapts us for every game.“Hopefully you can see it when we’re playing. Playing back foot, on the floor, speed of pass, ball speed, that’s what he’s shouting on the sideline. He’s just so detailed.“I think he gets the best out of us, especially technical players. He’s focused on the technical and tactical side so much that technical players do thrive under a coach like Nick.”Walsh is one who has thrived, so much so her young age is often overlooked. “I actually love Nick as a coach,” she said. “He’s always had my back throughout everything, since I was 17 years old. He’s always trusted me to play and always put absolute faith in me to do a job for him.”Her, Georgia Stanway and Lauren Hemp are a testament to Cushing’s dedication to developing young English players. That is a legacy, perhaps, of the way in which Manchester City have nurtured him. His move to New York City, one of the many teams in the City Football Group fold, despite interest from National Women’s Soccer League teams, keeps him under the business’s wing. He started as a City schools coach then became part of the Manchester City academy coaching staff with the 12-16 development phase before being handed the reins of their revamped women’s team.But moving mid-season is questionable. Yes, he does not leave until after City’s league fixture against title rivals Arsenal on 2 February and it will enable him to take part in pre-season in New York, but he abandons the women’s team when they are in a three-way fight for the championship with eight WSL games remaining – including league ties with Chelsea and Manchester United – and still involved in both domestic cup competitions.It is hard to imagine an almost four-week period with a departing manager in situ, and then a run of eight games with an interim boss in the current assistant, Alan Mahon, will not affect the team.It is seemingly a move driven by Cushing, who tweeted: “I feel the time is now right to take the next step on my footballing journey and the project presented to me at @NYCFC is one that excites me and offers a great environment to progress my career at a great club. It is with a heavy heart I depart Manchester and I’d like to thank the entire @ManCity team for the memories \u0026amp success we’ve shared.”Though it is hard not to feel that, as he leaves for a team within their circle, the City Football Group could have found a way to do more to limit the impact on the women’s team. It is difficult to begrudge Cushing a move after what he has achieved and it is a loss to women’s football that he departs for the men’s game.But perhaps the apparent willingness to facilitate a move which looks to prioritise the development of the Eastern Conference champions, who reached the MLS play-off semi-finals, over their WSL project hints at where the women’s team fits in the City Football Group empire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91cce301e4c397e92265643a17671ddcf4373334/364_497_2967_1780/master/2967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6765a1c741647ac49210efda19daddd0","title":"trent alexander arnold unassuming icon liverpool league quest","story":"In its 46 years, the PFA’s Player of the Year award has been given to 41 people, representing 15 clubs and 12 countries from England to Egypt. The winners have been young and old, tall and short, but they all have one thing in common: none of them have been full-backs. There is a lot of football still to be played this season but already it seems there is no doubt about the destiny of the title, and though there are several Liverpool players who will be in the discussion when the inidual awards are handed out, I think based on the campaign so far Trent Alexander-Arnold is edging it.I am a big fan of this kid on so many levels. It’s not just his contribution to the team, though that is immense, it is what he represents for English football as a homegrown player of genuine world class, and as a Liverpudlian at a club which has waited 30 years to win the league. Virgil van Dijk has sustained the levels he set when he won the PFA award last year while Sadio Mané has been outstanding in attack together with the hugely likable Roberto Firmino. I don’t think Mo Salah has been anywhere near as good this season as when he won the award two years ago, so I think the big award winners will come from that shortlist.The fact that a 21-year-old full-back is even in the conversation is a measure of his excellence. People talk about him redefining the position, and he is clearly doing something that right-backs haven’t managed before. The vision, finesse, technique and the number of assists Alexander-Arnold has contributed over the past two seasons have raised the bar for the position.Next week will be the third anniversary of his full league debut, against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a 1-1 draw. For most of the 2017-18 season he was second choice to Joe Gomez, but then last year he was third in the assist rankings and this season only Kevin De Bruyne has more than him, an astonishing contribution from a defender. Defensively he does his job, but it’s his picking out passes, switching play, his crossing ability, his consistency and his overall sharpness in match situations that is just amazing to see.When he was a child he wanted to be Steven Gerrard, which must have seemed like a far-fetched dream at the time. Sometimes we grow up wanting to be our idol, but actually we can do more. What Gerrard did as a midfielder for Liverpool was phenomenal but Alexander-Arnold is going above and beyond what he expected of himself, employing those midfielder qualities at right-back.He has spoken about his brothers, who sacrificed their football ambitions to allow him to realise his own. His first football memory, when he was six, is of watching the open‑top bus carrying Liverpool’s 2005 Champions League winners drive past his house. His background, his memories of sneaking to Melwood to catch glimpses of his heroes through the gates, mean he will be continuously inspired in that changing room. When he lifts the Premier League trophy after the club’s 30-year wait, it will be completing a full circle. You can’t buy that connection in the transfer market.Jürgen Klopp might be a master of motivation but one of his great skills is the ability to recognise talent in a young player and then develop it to the point where they become what Alexander-Arnold is now, where other managers might just spend a ridiculous amount of money on an established full-back who still wouldn’t be anywhere near as good. It seems to be hard sometimes for a manager to see the quality of players he is working with, when others are getting headlines elsewhere – look at De Bruyne, who was not rated at all by José Mourinho at Chelsea but has since become, well, Kevin De Bruyne.Liverpool focus a lot of their play on getting the ball wide to their attacking full-backs, but it is what they do with those crossing opportunities that sets them apart. Andy Robertson is exceptional on the left but he is being left in the shade by the man on the other flank. It is not only what he does with those crosses, it’s his ability to come inside and see a pass, to shoot from outside the box, to take set pieces, to pull the ball back to the forwards with pace and accuracy. In Liverpool’s win over Leicester on Boxing Day, Firmino’s movement for their third goal after the ball was played to Alexander-Arnold on the right showed that he knew where the ball was going, and the delivery was perfection. Everyone bangs on about the corner he took against Barcelona last season – the fearlessness, the vision, the quality – but he has just continued from there, making it look almost routine.Attacking full-backs are nothing new but what we haven’t seen is this level of quality and consistency. The only one I can think of who has made a similar contribution in terms of delivery in attacking areas is Marcelo at Real Madrid, though the Brazilian is 31 and has only once reached double figures for assists in a league season while Alexander-Arnold is on course to do it for the second time at the age of 21. Marcelo has stood out from other full-backs because of his ability to come inside, combine with forwards and get goals, but you could argue that Alexander-Arnold is now the best in the world in that position. And what makes him all the more exceptional is the fact he is a local lad who is quite unassuming, quite shy, says all the right things, and is just quietly going about his business of being an outstanding footballer.Liverpool play Tottenham on Saturday and then Manchester United, the only team to have taken league points off them this season and who overperform against the top sides, before a long run of games they would expect to win. If they are going to trip up, this is the period when it is going to happen. Already there is little doubt they are going to win the league, but if they win these two I think there’s a good chance they’ll go unbeaten. They have shown an incredible level of consistency and hunger and when finally, after three decades and generation after generation of gifted but frustrated footballers, Liverpool lift the Premier League trophy there will be no denying the contribution of Alexander-Arnold, an unassuming icon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ccfaf760ec878247a3af49c97fd61a9792e68d8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87477c5c73f628d3939dddf990d80a03","title":"tell us about outstanding customer service you received","story":"We want to hear from people who have received exceptional customer serviceAfter the Christmas spending flurry come the tales of corporate ill will, with botched delivery dates, faulty goods and customer service departments who don’t seem to listen or care.At this time of year, ’s consumer inboxes are congested with high street horror stories.Invisible in the background, some firms are going beyond the call of duty to fulfil orders and resolve issues.Often independent companies and occasionally big chains, handle complaints with care and respect, creating a better impression of themselves in the minds of their customers.We want to hear from people who have been bowled over by exceptional service, to show that corporate Britain can sometimes get it right.Has a trader driven through the night to ensure your goods reach you in time or soothed a situation with imaginative aplomb?Tell us about your experiences in the form below – one of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further and we’ll publish a selection as part of an upcoming feature.If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.

However, the reforms were immediately branded by campaigners as “nothing more than tinkering”.Amid widespread controversy over spiralling ground rents and extortionate demands from freeholders, the government last year asked the Law Commission to produce proposals to simplify the process and provide a better deal for leaseholders.During the consultation period, campaigners almost unanimously sought a simple new formula for extending or buying out a lease, arguing for a price set at 10 times the ground rent.However, the Law Commission rejected such a formula, saying it would be a likely breach of the human rights of freeholders. It said: “The law governing human rights is highly relevant to valuation reform”, noting that the European convention on human rights “provides for the peaceful enjoyment of property”.The commission instead set out three options for reform – one of which broadly maintains the status quo, while the other two eliminate what is known as “marriage value” and “hope value”.It gave a worked example of someone with a £250,000 property with only 76 years left on the lease and a current ground rent of £50 rising to £200 a year. It said under existing calculations, the leaseholder would have to pay £16,453 to buy out the lease. Under its proposals, the cost would fall to £10,615 if “hope” value is reformed, and drop to £9,155 if there is no “marriage value”.The property law commissioner, professor Nick Hopkins, said: “We were asked to provide options for reform that save leaseholders money when buying their freehold or extending their lease, while ensuring that sufficient compensation is paid to landlords. This is what we’ve done. We are ready to help the government in implementing whichever options for reform they choose.”Welcoming the report, the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said he will consider the proposals and set out the government’s response. “We have already committed to addressing the abuses of leasehold seen in recent years, by reducing ground rents to a peppercorn level and limiting new leasehold to apartments, save in the most exceptional circumstances. The Competition and Markets Authority is examining the alleged mis-selling of leasehold properties and I will also await their findings with interest.”However, campaigners said they were deeply disappointed by the Law Commission proposals. Sebastian O’Kelly of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership said: “It is very difficult to be too enthusiastic about options to government which give the £2.5bn annual leasehold enfranchisement sector plenty of scope to dilute any meaningful reform.“A process which began with the aim of making the enfranchisement process more open and cheaper now has heavy emphasis on the ‘human rights’ of property owners – even when anonymous ground-rent speculators in the British Virgin Islands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de4ce22bd52e44f5e8a9a5a4c16cbb99a252a921/0_189_5683_3410/master/5683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24a90d5de8bf33d8263b4a52b0446178","title":"keeley forsyth how the happy valley actor became the new scott walker","story":"She was enjoying a successful if gruelling film and TV career when serious illness struck. But Forsyth has channelled that experience into a bleakly beautiful avant-garde albumYorkshire is the backdrop to many disquieting works of art, such as David Peace’s Red Riding Quartet, Bram Stoker’s Dracula and the Brontës’ explorations of the soul. The newest is Debris, an album made by a 40-year-old actor with a familiar, pale-eyed, haunting face, whom we have seen in recent years playing a sex worker in Sally Wainwright’s Happy Valley and heroin addicts in The Casual Vacancy and Waterloo Road.Keeley Forsyth’s debut as a musician is an avant-garde proposition, however: a shivery descendent of Scott Walker’s Tilt, a more unsettling older sister of Aldous Harding’s Designer. Forsyth’s voice marries Peggy Lee’s bluesy vibrato with Nico’s thunderous terror, and delivers lyrics that invert nature, as a way of exploring despair. Large oaks descend and grow roots. Salt hills move. Madness unfurls.Add to the mix Forsyth’s image in her videos and artwork (Virginia Woolf as directed by Bertolt Brecht), and spacious, stark arrangements by the composers Matthew Bourne and Sam Hobbs (Forsyth emailed Bourne the songs she had recorded on her laptop, without a microphone, after hearing him on Radio 3’s Late Junction he loved them). The results are bleakly beautiful.Forsyth is easy to spot when she collects me at Harrogate station. She moved here in 2016, after 20 years living in London. Three-and-a-half hours ensue, discussing art, despair, kids and creativity over oat-milk lattes and soup her joy in her new work is contagious. “I feel alive when I’m doing this,” she says, smiling (she smiles often). “My work isn’t meant to be painful. All I’ve wanted to do is open up and connect with people.”Forsyth was born in 1979 in Oldham, the eldest of five children, although she was brought up by her grandmother (her parents were “very young” when they had her, she explains). Her gran, a psychiatric nurse who worked night shifts, was a comforting presence, surrounding Forsyth with songs from musicals and singers such as Doris Day. Forsyth acted from the age of eight in Oldham Theatre Workshop. So did her younger half-brother, the Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher, who won Strictly Coming Dancing in December (of whom she’s “really, really proud”).“The youth theatre wasn’t fun,” she explains. “It was work, but I loved that. The way that performing involved fear, excitement … then relief. It was a shock getting back to real life after that.”At 16, Forsyth got a regular role on the BBC kids’ drama The Biz, after which she “fell into” TV acting (The Bill, Peak Practice and Heartbeat all feature on her CV). But her heart was often elsewhere. She had trained as a dancer (the German choreographer Pina Bausch is her major creative inspiration), had lessons with a local opera singer and auditioned without success for West End musicals. “I considered doing Stars in Their Eyes once, as Karen Carpenter,” she laughs. “But I never wanted to just be a fan of the music. I wanted to be part of it.”In 2009, she met the performance artists Matthew Boyle and Adrian Shaw, who gave her the creative freedom she craved. With them, she created a character for performance called The Scuttler, “this woman who lived in the hills in a trenchcoat, who didn’t speak, just used her voice in strange ways”. The lyrical protagonist on Debris holds her shadows, she admits.Soon after, Forsyth had her two daughters, now 10 and seven. She split from their father, who sees them often, but she is their sole parent at home. After becoming a mother, her musical expression felt more urgent, especially around the chaos and frequent disappointments of acting life. “Having the girls – giving birth to them – also made me think more about the sounds that come from our bodies,” she says. “It made me go deeper into myself physically in that way.”A few years later, Forsyth’s friend Maxine Peake introduced her to the musicians Adrian Flanagan and Dean Honer they were then performing as the Eccentronic Research Council. Honer lent Forsyth his harmonium, and they worked on early versions of her songs. Forsyth’s acting CV was also getting fancier. As well as more experimental films such as Carol Morley’s Edge, she was in a Marvel blockbuster, s of the Galaxy, where she spent four weeks in heavy makeup playing “Mottled Prisoner”. Then came big-budget TV.Her roles in those shows were almost always traumatised figures on the edges of life. Did that affect her? “Yes.” Forsyth is at pains to say she is not being judgmental about ordinary people in similar positions, but feels she was typecasting herself. She would head home to look after two children alone. “I was exhausting myself, using my emotions to stimulate worse emotions. It wasn’t a healthy way for me to live.” She also felt she was on the wrong path. “I couldn’t do anything about it. Then I just couldn’t do it any more.”Forsyth “hit a wall” psychologically and physically in 2017 she was so ill, she spent a month not being able to move her tongue. This sense of abstract terror soaks through Debris. Its title track begins with a pulse and a breath, a fox twisting, someone being begged not to leave, someone else insisting they “ain’t going”. Elsewhere, a black bull cries the sea pushes someone away someone longs to be the space around a raven’s wings. Look to Yourself is specifically about Forsyth trying to settle her children to sleep, but many of these songs have personal inspirations, although they stand separately from them, too, Forsyth explains.Then there is Lost, which even Forsyth finds a hard listen. It begins with her murmuring: “Is this what madness feels like?”, then describing how it feels: “The smooth space after all boundaries have been dissolved  Where there is wind, high wind  But no tall trees for it to grapple with  No buckets for it to shove around the yard.”It was the track Forsyth was most scared to have on the album, but also to not have on the album. Why? “Because it is too much. But then again, when I was coming out of all of that, I had this realisation that, yes, I’ve gone through these things, but I don’t have to be them.” At the same time, she was playing a mother possessed by a cult in the 2018 film The Devil Outside (directed by Andrew Hulme, with whom she is now making videos). “I made sure I stepped outside of that role on set. I gained a stronger sense of self to observe my work.” And Forsyth has noticed that when she is talking about Debris, she calls the woman singing the lyrics “she”. “And ‘she’ has to be a character. I have my own life to live.”Forsyth nevertheless hopes to take “she” out on tour this year. A live performance is being developed with the film-makers Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, who made Nick Cave’s 20,000 Days on Earth. Her next album has also been sketched out, and Bourne has even bought her a microphone. “It’s sitting on top of my microwave, of course.” She is also excited about exploring electronic sounds as on Start Again, the latest single from the album and Debris’ final track.The song’s protagonist is waiting for lightning to strike her as angels laugh at her, then turn their backs. But Forsyth knows what happens next. “The lightning struck me. And I kept going.”Debris is released on Friday 17 January on the Leaf Label"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df99b78331d335571ecc45028a1d714383a93283/407_0_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84fbae303554d9e83cbbbc4355edd530","title":"all aboard australias elvis express in pictures","story":"The Parkes Elvis festival is held every year in the second week in January in New South Wales.

Anyone who is even suspected of thinking about Brexit will be condemned to a public show trial. As far as the government is concerned, the UK will have left the EU and that’s an end to it. Even to discuss the details of a future arrangement will be considered grossly unpatriotic, with offenders being sent to re-education camps.This is the way the Brexit department ends. Not with a bang, but by being airbrushed out of history. And to mark the occasion of his department’s final question session in the Commons, Stephen Barclay was determined to end his ministerial career as he had started it – with complete and utter anonymity. For Barclay it is a matter of pride to never say anything memorable. His whole job as Brexit secretary was to do next to nothing and he has fulfilled the brief superbly. At times he has even uttered sentences that have put himself to sleep.“Is this the end of the department?” said Hilary Benn plaintively. The chairman of the Brexit select committee can see his own position disappearing at the very moment when he knows his job was really only just beginning. Another reason why Dominic Cummings was so keen to see the end of the Brexit department. Parliamentary scrutiny is for losers.It looks that way, Barclay shrugged. He did not seem unduly bothered that his department was being wound up prematurely. Why should he? He knows there will always be a place in government for someone who can effortlessly fill dead air with even deader air and Boris Johnson is sure to offer him something else. Not least when there are other deadbeats such as Andrea Leadsom and Liz Truss whom he can easily replace. That’s one of the joys of the current cabinet. So many jobs, so little talent.Barclay’s voice melted into liquid Mogadon as he tried to fill the unforgiving, inconsequential hour. His first task was to reassure everyone on the Tory benches that “The Word That Couldn’t Be Mentioned After 31 January” would be properly celebrated across the nation. Special ales would be brewed, flags would be waved, Big Ben would carry on ringing until the bell became detached from its moorings and the tower was turned to rubble.And from now on, between 11 and 11.30 in the morning, every citizen would be expected to participate in a daily collective act of gratitude for the country’s deliverance from the EU by prostrating themselves before statues of a naked baby Boris being swaddled by Classic Dom: The Madomma and Child. Pulling down his trousers to reveal some Union Jack toilet paper hanging out of his underpants, Tory John Hayes was the first of many to assert that 30 minutes wasn’t nearly long enough.Tim Farron briefly chipped in to say that it might be an idea to remember that more people had voted for parties supporting remain than The Word That Couldn’t Be Mentioned After 31 January at the recent election, so if the government was serious about uniting the country, a good place to start would be to dial down the triumphalism. Barclay looked astonished, as if it had genuinely never occurred to him that some people might not be entirely jubilant at the UK’s departure from the EU, but reluctantly agreed to set up a helpline for traumatised remoaners. An 0800 number, charged at 45p a minute, where callers would be kept on hold for 75 minutes before being told to bugger off by someone in an overseas call centre.Apart from junior minister James Duddridge making a point of rubbishing Dominic Grieve – a particularly graceless piece of grandstanding from a man who has never yet found a principle he wouldn’t trade to progress his career – the rest of the session passed with MPs doing little more than going through the motions. The third Brexit minister, Robin Walker, couldn’t even be bothered to speak. There again, there wasn’t anything to say. The government can now do exactly as it wants and all the sting has gone out of the Brexit debate.Even Keir Starmer sounded only passingly interested as he reminded Barclay that while the government may have won the vote on child migrants – Johnson has enough trouble keeping track of his own children without having to bother about a whole load of Syrian kiddies – Labour had won the moral argument. Then Starmer also has the small matter of a leadership election to concentrate on. Not easy when the congenitally hopeless Barry Gardiner had just thrown a curveball by suggesting he might also stand. Was this Bazza’s idea of a joke? It’s hard to think of someone who would make a worse Labour leader. Other than Richard Burgon. No wonder Starmer always looks permanently startled.It was a morning of endings. At business questions, there was a rare sighting of Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has been kept hidden since the opening day of the election campaign when he screwed up so catastrophically by revealing his true personality. With an 80-seat majority the ERG are now irrelevant and Jacob’s days in cabinet are numbered. Just how toxic he now is was soon apparent. Not one of his colleagues joined him on the frontbench for what is sure to be one of his final appearances as Commons leader.Rees-Mogg tried to make light of his isolation, but the pathos was unavoidable. Hubris has caught up with him. He tried to sound sincere about the Australian bushfires. But everyone knew that what he was really thinking was that the humans, koalas and kangaroos who had been burned to death were just a bit dim. If only he had been there he would have known exactly how to escape the fires."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52d4d742f9d29e80afd4bc413575fecee8c2de66/0_368_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c6a419d092b5d764f726a48e518cbb3","title":"mod blunders caused spiralling trident costs nuclear sites","story":"Report exposes delays and the surging price of maintaining Britain’s nuclear deterrentThe cost of maintaining three nuclear sites spiralled by £1.35bn because of poor management by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Whitehall’s watchdog has found.The National Audit Office has also said that work to complete the building and maintenance of the UK’s Trident nuclear deterrent in Cumbria, Derbyshire and Berkshire will also be completed more than six years later than planned.In a damning conclusion to a report released on Friday, auditors said the MoD has failed to learn from past mistakes while upgrading the UK’s nuclear defence capabilities.Civil servants have relied on the work of three monopolistic suppliers – the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE), Rolls Royce and BAE Systems – which means that contracts cannot be terminated if poor performance is identified, the report said.Nearly half of the extra costs – £647m – has been put down to the revision of work which was launched without proper plans.The findings follow confirmation that Dominic Cummings is seeking to launch a review of the MoD’s spending strategy following concerns that it has wasted billions over misjudged procurement.The ministry was given a £2.2bn increase in funds in September’s spending review. In February, parliament’s public accounts committee identified a £7bn blackhole in its 10-year plan for equipment.Auditors examined three programmes within the nuclear enterprise programme to replace ageing facilities, some dating back to the 1950s.They were the construction of a new nuclear warhead assembly facility in Burghfield, Berkshire the erection of a new nuclear core production facility in Raynesway, Derbyshire and the construction of a facility at the BAE shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness.While the three projects were valued at £2.5bn, auditors found that costs had risen by £1.35bn with delays running at between 1.7 and 6.3 years.The MoD was continuing to repeat mistakes made in the last cycle of investment in the nuclear enterprise in the 1980s and 1990s, the report found.They included “starting to build before requirements or designs were sufficiently mature, increasing risks through inappropriate contracts and failing to engage with regulators to understand requirements”.Similar problems had also been encountered in UK civil nuclear projects and US defence programmes, but the NAO said it had found no evidence of lessons being shared or learned.Among the specific problems highlighted, auditors said delays to project Mensa – the Burghfield scheme – had meant the MoD had to spend an additional £21m to keep existing facilities going.Some of the work was subjected to specific and expensive designs, sometimes referred to as “gold-plating”, the report said. This forced costs up but could not be challenged because the MoD and the site operators struggled to recruit staff able to challenge complex demands by regulators.“Throughout our study, the department, regulators and site operators all considered it had occurred and remained a potential risk,” it said.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “While these infrastructure projects are complex, the MoD has encountered similar challenges before in its nuclear work.“Although it has recently introduced changes to enhance its oversight of the projects and improve its contracts with suppliers, it should have learnt earlier from past mistakes and the experience of others in the nuclear sector.“Instead, the MoD’s failure to mitigate commercial and delivery risks early on has led to project delays and cost increases, as well as impacting its wider work.”An MoD spokesperson said: “As the National Audit Office has acknowledged, nuclear infrastructure projects are often large and complex with niche designs. We are carefully examining the conclusions in their report and will respond formally in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7801c23fdf6ec7603b40bf3ff7336eac7c626d0f/0_118_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4615482d9b371b08ce47fc8ef3e3e3d4","title":"spacewatch spacex elon musk launches 60 more satellites into starlink constellation","story":"Launch by Elon Musk’s company brings number of deployed Starlink satellites to 180 Elon Musk’s SpaceX began the year with the launch of 60 more satellites in its Starlink constellation.

But the era of the smart eco-home may actually be closer than you think.Futurologists and energy experts say that by 2030, we could be able to use existing reconfigurable materials and augmented reality to change the shape of our furniture, for example changing a brown leather sofa into a plush red velvet one, simply by commanding our in-home AI system. Smart cushions will change colour like chameleons to suit your mood. Bed covers will adapt to your body temperature for maximum snuggling.Innovations are afoot in the kitchen, too. Hydroponic gardens are already a reality, used in a growing number of restaurants around the world and even in branches of Veggie Pret – but by 2030 we may have these at home. Hydroponics uses LED lights to grow vegetables without soil in a compact space, and to keep them fresh for longer. And smart appliances such as kettles and toasters will store energy during off-peak times, so that they are cheaper to use when you actually need them. For now, though, we have smart meters and not only are they making us more energy efficient, they are going to be a main player in reaching the UK’s 2050 emissions target.Meanwhile, smart bathrooms may help to improve efficiency by generating power from toilet and shower wastewater, or even filtering it to make the home water self-sufficient.Buildings will be made from recycled materials, with improved insulation and solar panels on the rooftops and even in the windows. Modular rooms can be added as your family grows and then removed again when the kids leave home, allowing a more controlled usage of the energy supply. Sensors could track residents around the house, adjusting the temperature and lighting in each room accordingly.At the heart of this system are smart meters. Already available at no additional cost across Britain from your energy supplier, these gadgets monitor household energy use throughout the day and report data back to network operators, which helps to predict demand and generate the supply accordingly. They also tell users when electricity rates are cheapest, for more cost-efficient use.“A smart energy system makes it easier for us to draw on and store electricity when it’s less in demand, and then use it again when scarce or more expensive later in the day,” says Robert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs, Smart Energy GB. “Together, smart meters and a smart energy system help to create a cleaner, greener Britain.”There are already 15.6m smart meters installed in homes and businesses across Britain, and these devices not only make efficient energy use easy through visibility of consumption, they also display your near-real time costs in pounds and pence so that you can keep in better control of your spending.Stepping further into sci-fi utopia, smart meters can help to unlock the possibility of a shared electricity system for each local community, taking advantage of shared renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind farms, and powering things like a communal electric car pool as a convenient yet eco-friendly alternative to public transport.Electric car ownership is likely to rise anyway, as new government legislation will soon make it compulsory for all new-build homes with a dedicated parking space to include a charging point. With the help of a smart meter and a smart charger, cars will charge during off-peak hours, reducing the cost of fuel to as little as 3p per mile – compared with 11p for petrol and diesel cars.“There might even be instances where you could get paid to charge your car when the power system needs us to use more power,” said futurologist Dr Ian Pearson, during a panel discussion hosted by Smart Energy GB.With fossil fuels, it is easy for the energy companies to control the supply – when more power is needed, they just burn more coal. But renewable energy does not work this way: sun and wind power dictate their own routines.The best part is, you won’t even have to think about it. Once the system is set up, the smart meter, alongside your smart appliances, chargers and services will do all the work, managing your supply automatically according to your preferences. And the addition of batteries will make it possible to store power in the home.Saving energy, saving money, saving the environment. Smart eco-homes (and the smart meters that enable them) will become an integral part of a greener Britain – and the future could be with us in less than a decade.Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB, a government-backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c1b4657ba7312bd0e8d362a78ac39d9426539a/0_182_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5ec0d8b58a897edb1fd389ca058787","title":"my house would only let good people in how kids see their homes of the future","story":"From houses that speak to you to magnifying glasses on the roof for energy, we take a glimpse into the future through the eyes of our youngest generation Fynn Rodell, 11: ‘The sun will heat my oven’I’m going to have loads of tech on my house to make it carbon neutral. I’ll have a wind turbine on the roof to generate electricity for lighting. There will be solar panels on the front door for more energy, and a magnifying glass on the roof to focus the sun’s heat for my oven. A vent will help suck the heat in and spread it around the house for extra heating when I’m not cooking. There will be a smart meter in the house to see how much energy I’m creating and how much I’m using.I’ll grow plants on the roof for insulation, to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and for insects to live there.The turbine on the roof will also power a water cleanser, so I can turn rainwater into drinking and washing water. I’ll have a toilet vacuum like on an airplane so that I don’t waste much water.Rosabela O’Selle-Goncalves, seven: ‘My house will say good things to you if you help the environment’In my house of the future the door should be brown, the house should be peach, and the roof should be red. There wouldn’t be much made from plastic, because if the plastic gets in the rivers it kills the animals.If you do really good things the house will see it and say good things about you because you’re helping the environment. It might say bad stuff if you ruin the environment, or it won’t speak to you.I would like that to happen – it’d be very nice for the house to look and speak to you because it’ll make you feel happy.My house would be medium-sized and you wouldn’t need keys, it would open if I put my hand on the door, but if a stranger put their hand on it, it wouldn’t open. It would know if people coming to the house were good or bad and would only let good people in.It wouldn’t have loads of food because it’s bad for the environment to waste it. To get water you don’t turn a tap on, you press a button and tell it how much water you want. When I walk in the lights will go on and if I leave they go off.Indy Williams, six: ‘Animals that have lost their habitats can come and live with us’In the future, my house will have solar panels on the roof to generate electricity for the TV, maybe a wind turbine too. We’ll still have our pet cats, but if other animals have lost their habitats then they can come and live with us as well. There’ll be a sliding door to the garden where we keep our bikes and also grow tomatoes, cucumbers and pomegranates.In the winter, all the inside walls will be covered in sheep’s wool so the house will be all cosy, like the inside of a slipper. We’ll have small windows and very big windows because it’s nice to have lots of sun, but not when you’re asleep. In the summer we’ll have a street party where no one will smoke or use plastic.Arianna Burke, nine: ‘A robot will sense when you’re wasting energy’I believe environmentally friendly homes of the future will have light switches that switch off in an hour or two when no one is inside.I think there would also be some sort of robot that senses if devices like the TV are on and knows whether people are there or not, and if not, it switches them off. I also think all houses should have solar panels on them automatically when they are built.Rai Rodell, nine: ‘I’ll collect rainwater for animals to drink’I’m going to have lots of animals in my house and in my garden. I’m going to grow food in the garden for me and my animals, and some seeds for the birds. I’ll put bird boxes on the roof so they have somewhere to live.The balcony will shelter the outdoor animals when it rains. I’ll make sure there’s a rain collector on the side of the house and use the water to flush the toilet, but also for the animals to drink.Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed.

The panel, chaired by Anil Kumble, will offer its recommendation to the world governing body’s executive committee, with such a significant change likely to also require sign-off from the full ICC board before being implemented.Strauss is open-minded about the concept itself given the pressure it could potentially ease in terms of scheduling, costs and player workloads – a view doubtless informed by his three and a half years as England’s director of cricket. But the former opener accepts that the arguments in favour must be compelling – and part of an overall push to promote the longest format – given an emotive topic that this week led Fica, the global players’ union, to warn of “significant” resistance without it.“If you asked how many people want to reduce Test matches down from five days to four, the answer is probably not that many,” Strauss told the . “My gut feeling is that we should be looking at the whole picture, how Test cricket can be looking as healthy as possible in future, then work back from that.“We shouldn’t assume Test cricket is healthy just because it is popular in England. In lots of parts of the world boards are struggling financially and Test cricket is not paying the bills. So we have to look at ways to improve the product for all. That’s the spectacle, the cricket itself, the costs, the schedules, the pitches, the balls, the experience. We need a World Test Championship that is meaningful and compelling. The length of the game is only one part of that bigger discussion.“This isn’t something that is being proposed with an agenda behind it. No one wants to change for the sake of it. It should be an easy sell or we shouldn’t be doing it.”Strauss added that his personal preference is for the Ashes to remain a five-day, five-match affair and admitted that shrinking Test matches on the subcontinent may not be straightforward given pitches can take longer to deteriorate.The 42-year-old is the third member of the ICC cricket committee to speak publicly on the subject, with Mahela Jayawardene, the former Sri Lanka batsman, and Mickey Arthur, Sri Lanka’s new head coach, both firmly in favour of five-day Tests.The England and Wales Cricket Board has already offered cautious support for four-day Tests – Strauss, an ECB consultant, sits on the ICC cricket committee as a former player – while Australia, South Africa and New Zealand are also in favour.Much will hinge on the views in India, where Sourav Ganguly, the BCCI president, has thus far declined to state a position and is due for talks with senior officials from Cricket Australia in Mumbai before next week’s ODI series between the two countries.Virat Kohli, India’s Test captain, and Sachin Tendulkar, the country’s most revered former player, and Ravi Shastri, the current head coach, have all voiced their opposition, however, the last of these saying on Thursday: “Four-day Test is nonsense.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f6d46405fc534a9b17e66073883fe627fcea49d/84_120_3353_2012/master/3353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=324bcec6c5de3ac5d0e250c78ac3b1b9","title":"dan evans jamie murray great britain tennis atp cup","story":"Dan Evans, Cameron Norrie, Jamie Murray and Joe Salisbury left Sydney with heroics to cherish and bruises to heal. But Tim Henman, their part-time muse, was quick to remind them in the immediate aftermath of losing 2-1 to Australia in the knockout stage of the first ATP Cup that their privilege and obligations as elite athletes should be guided by the scoreboard more than the heart – or, in Evans’s case, his stomach.“Yeah, I think Evo could miss a few meals,” Henman said with a laugh when reflecting on how Evans had to push himself to the limit of his endurance to beat the indefatigable Alex de Minaur 7-6 (4), 4-6, 7-6 (2), in three hours and 23 minutes, the longest match of the tournament, to keep the tie alive.Evans, who lost 11 months of his career to a drugs ban, has been the hero of the British campaign. His performance on Thursday was “phenomenal”, Henman said. And there should be more to come.A year ago, Evans was 189 in the world when pushing Roger Federer to two tie-breaks in the second round of the Australian Open he will return to Melbourne on 20 January ranked 31 in the world – and inside the seedings boundary.“It’s easier said than done, but his variation – to use the slice, the change of pace, hit the backhand down the line to open up the forehand to get forward, serving and volleying ... He’s got options in his game and it’s not always easy to choose the right ones. Today, that level of tennis was phenomenal, and it rates alongside any grand slam at any stage. For him to play well, I really wanted him to get the rewards he deserved in that match – and he did. It’s a huge positive to take out of this.”But Henman wants to see him reproduce that level more often. “To reach the standard is the easy bit, playing in this environment on an indoor court. It’s harder when you’re at a lesser event and it’s windy. That’s when you’ve got to deliver. We know the level is incredibly high. He’s got to keep building on that. It’s a process day in, day out. His tennis skills, his physical skills are there, it’s a challenge mentally. Now, with a bit more maturity, I think there are exciting times ahead for Dan.”Surprisingly hauled back into the sport’s mainstream by Andy Murray – who withdrew at the last minute to work on a stubborn groin strain - Henman drew on his own distinguished achievements as a player to bring a hard-headed pragmatism to the players’ efforts, dramatically so in their farewell performance against the most obdurate of long-time sporting rivals.The agony of Jamie Murray and Salisbury losing the deciding doubles to De Minaur and Nick Kyrgios should not diminish Evans’s achievement against the world No 18, Henman said. Murray blew the easiest of their four match points in the 30-minute tie-break that would have put them through to Saturday’s semi-finals against either Belgium or Spain, and spoke honestly about it afterwards.“I missed that shot basically on top of the net, which was ridiculous,” he said. “We played a good first set, and then let them back into it with a soft break at the start of the second set. Got the break back. Again, gave away a break. All of a sudden it’s a tie-break and it’s anyone’s game. But that will hurt. Should have never missed that shot. I’ll probably never miss it again in my career. That cost us.”Henman, who will return to his board duties at the All England Club – and his beloved golf – is guardedly optimistic about the future of British tennis. “Actions speak louder than words,” he said. “We can talk about it until we’re blue in the face.“Likewise on the ladies’ side. If you can get the healthy competition, with the girls pushing each other, I think that’s good. Davis Cup at the end of last year, we put in a strong performance here. We’ve seen Fed Cup, some pretty impressive matches. So we have to try to maintain that momentum. At the top of the game, that’s always an important area.“We still the need the younger ones coming through in the juniors. I’m always on the end of the phone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2183322c51acf08f0e8c96981415772e95938a5d/0_99_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbab76acf0df40ddf5ca004648c0725e","title":"mo farah alberto salazar i would have left sooner","story":"Sir Mo Farah has claimed he would have been the “first one out” of the Nike Oregon Project if he had known about Alberto Salazar’s dubious practices – despite sticking with his former coach for two years after serious allegations were made against him in 2015.Farah had previously refused to be overly critical of Salazar after he was banned by the US Anti-Doping Agency for four years last October, instead turning his crosshairs on reporters when they asked him whether he felt let down by his former mentor.But in an interview with the BBC on Thursday the 36-year-old, who worked under Salazar between 2011 and 2017, said he would have acted differently if he knew what was really going on.“I believe in clean sports,” said Farah, who was asked whether his legacy was tainted by his association with a coach who had violated anti-doping rules. “I continue to enjoy my sports and do what I do. At the same time had I had known the news, what Salazar did, it’s taken four years, had I known that sooner I would have been the first one out,” Farah, 36, said.“That’s the bit that’s kind of annoying, I wish I’d known quicker. But at the same time I will continue to make my country proud and make the kids proud.”However Farah, who recently announced he would return to the track to run the 10,000m in Tokyo, is still likely to continue to face questions about why he stuck with Salazar after 2015 when the BBC and ProPublica raised serious questions about some of his methods, including the use of the banned drug testosterone on his sons in a bizarre experiment. That sparked a formal investigation by Usada (the US anti-doping agency), who in October announced that Salazar had been banned for “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct”.In Farah’s defence, a UK Athletics inquiry in 2015 found “no reason to be concerned” about his working with Salazar in the autumn. However that is now the subject of a fresh and forensic independent review to see what mistakes were made and the lessons that can be learned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe4af67c63ab0f87906865555438b66350fcd3f/64_115_3078_1847/master/3078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c524a9cb0e3a8ca16ccc5f372fae92f","title":"zak crawley england test south africa rory burns","story":"Suddenly there is a changing of the guard. In the last Test there were two Doms and a Zak in the team, the first Zak ever to play for England. A year ago the idea that the Dominics, Sibley and Bess, and Zak Crawley would be in the same Test side was fanciful to the say the least. Now they have participated in a famous victory at Cape Town, where England had not prevailed since 1957.Sibley starred with the bat, Bess bowled more overs than anyone while the most memorable contributions of Crawley, catapulted into the team after the injury to Rory Burns, were actually in the field. On that gripping final day he took two vital catches in a manner that epitomised the excellence of England’s outcricket.He calmly plucked the ball out of the air when Quinton de Kock pulled a Joe Denly long hop in his direction. But it was the first-ball dismissal of Anrich Nortje that sticks most readily in the memory. Once Crawley had produced that brilliant reflex catch in the slip cordon it was clear that there was no denying England’s sprint to victory. He parried the ball with his right hand before gathering it as he lay on the grass in his left. Crawley happily recalls the moment.“Stokes was bowling so fast and we were so close to the wicket that it was just a matter of sticking my hand out and luckily I managed to make it go up in the air and to get my other hand on it. It was a great moment when I saw it come down. It lasted a lifetime as it seemed to hover in the air. Thankfully we got the final wicket and it wasn’t in vain.”Crawley would have been a spectator in Cape Town but for the freakish injury to Rory Burns. “It was a shame to lose Rory,” he said. “He’s been in great form. But you know it’s always good to play a Test match. I knew the night before Rory would be out for a number of weeks. So for me it was the usual nerves early in your Test cricket career. But actually I was a lot better than my debut in Hamilton so hopefully it’ll be easier next time as well.”So Crawley’s voyage of discovery has started and it should be entertaining watching him develop since his natural instinct is to put bat to ball. To succeed he has to trust those instincts. But already we know he can catch, which is always a good sign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5304ecccd2cf8e0cd8300a9109f45fb239cd1fcc/593_913_3140_1884/master/3140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=365610c7d7f486585436b8f3662e434c","title":"ballet reimagining classics colonial politics dance race identity","story":"Historical ballets are rife with offensive colonial politics but choreographers and dancers are finding creative ways to change them for today’s audiencesA 19th-century worldview informs much of the classical ballet repertoire. Historical ballets are rife with national and racial stereotypes, including the orientalism of La Bayadère, Le Corsaire and Scheherazade, the Chinese (“Tea”) and Arabian (“Coffee”) variations in The Nutcracker, and the character of the Moor in Petrushka, originally played in blackface.While there has been recent progress (the major UK ballet companies have now revised their Chinese dances and you won’t see blackface on UK stages – although you might in other countries), there remains a seam of stubborn resistance. When I spoke last year to Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo director Jean-Christophe Maillot, he revealed a desire to preserve in aspic not only the steps and costumes of historical ballets, but also the outdated and offensive politics and sensibilities. Alongside that comes an entrenched racism in so-called “traditional” ideas about what certain ballets should look like and who can dance them.To look deeper into the topic, I talked to dancers and choreographers about ballet’s slow pace of change, which problematic ballets should be thrown out and which ones could be creatively reimagined.Created her own response to La Bayadère, entitled Bayadère – The Ninth LifeWhen I first saw La Bayadère it made me squirm. It was an embarrassing portrait of India. No matter how many explanatory notes you have in the programme, you experience dance when the lights go down and something moving hits your eye. How can you put all the good intentions and explanations that you signal in the programme into that experience? That discussion is long overdue.If many of the 19th-century ballet classics have the same entitled and Eurocentric viewpoint, then this is something that surely has to be tempered. Every branch of the arts has had to engage with the legacy of colonialism, so I don’t see why ballet can’t do the same. I don’t think there’s an easy answer but one has to make a start. The British Museum’s exhibition on orientalism displays contested paintings of eastern women by European artists, but at the end three contemporary Middle Eastern female artists are given the space to respond. One leaves with an understanding of the past and respect for the present.Shakespeare presents us with similar challenges in Othello, or the compliant woman in The Taming of the Shrew or the conversion of Jewish Jessica at the end of The Merchant of Venice. All these plays have been successfully staged for the modern audience, with its different historical and religious sensitivities, without losing the power of the original text. What is the text of the dance? It’s the choreography, and in Bayadère the tale of love and betrayal. It’s not the harem pants or the orientalism. Surely classical dance can survive without the navel jewels?La Bayadère is a choreographically robust ballet and the intention is not to vandalise it. I’m not criticising the choreographer, Marius Petipa. He was a man of his time, who did brilliantly well for his time. I would like to think we could do equally brilliantly for our time.Co-founded Final Bow for Yellowface, a campaign dedicated to eliminating outdated representations of Asians on stageIf we only ever see Asians in the media as two-dimensional caricatures, our imaginal worlds become impoverished. Surely, given rich cultures to draw from, we can find better representations?Is it possible to retain tradition while updating works to be more respectful? Our aim isn’t to call out racist elements in classical ballets, but to spark creative problem-solving. In the Balanchine choreography, a cliche of a Chinaman pops out of a box. What if it was a jumping cricket instead? Crickets are a respectful image from Chinese culture and logically could perform the same choreography, all big jumps. What does it take away? Nothing. We’re not asking companies to redo the whole Nutcracker, or stop doing it altogether. We’re just talking about changing some of the shuffling, head bobbing and gross makeup.We are actually very conservative in our approach, because we are dancers too. But what we’re saying is that if we don’t change it, if we don’t imagine ways to make these ballets bigger to respond to the world we live in today, they’re going to die.If you think about what a performing art is, change is an inherent part of it. It’s not fixed like sculpture or painting. The original Black Swan tutu was canary yellow Giselle had national dances in the second act until Petipa changed it there are several versions of Balanchine’s Apollo. So if we’re changing some things, why are we are clinging to outdated representations of race?I’ve developed a tool, a grid with two axes, to help understand potential problems and find solutions. On one axis you have “character” at one end and “caricature” at the other. The second goes from “historical accuracy” to “fantasy”. You could say Madama Butterfly is character, not caricature – Cio Cio San has emotional depth – but it’s also fantasy, it’s not historically accurate. Le Corsaire is also fantasy, but it traffics unflattering tropes of Arabs, so I would say it’s caricature. It’s one way to think about this constructively.I’m currently working on a new Bayadère with dance scholar Doug Fullington. It’s not set in India but in Busby Berkeley’s Hollywood, so our production will have cowgirls dancing with lassos, but we’re going back to the notations of Petipa’s choreography. My Corsaire, rather than taking place at an Arabian slave bazaar, would be at a children’s dance competition with a director saying: “OK, I’m going to watch 50 kids do crazy variations and pick the best one to join our company.” That’s Corsaire! It takes away the misogyny, the slavery, the orientalism – and you can still put sequins everywhere.Our message is to think about other ways to do this work for today. Because that’s what good, living art does. What makes a ballet a classic is that it can withstand the warping of time.I performed in Petrushka, in the original format, in my second or third year of the company. I think it was 2007. Being new to the company, my initial thought was: this is theatre, this is what they need to do in order to portray certain characters – they apply makeup to make the Moor black – which is why I never questioned it. I was new, trying to do my job the best I could.Things have moved on. We’re reassessing everything to be in line with the contemporary world. Blackface is unacceptable. But it’s an interesting conversation to have because otherwise Petrushka is a genuine masterpiece, part of our ballet heritage, but it’s just not acceptable to perform it.In The Nutcracker, we’ve reconsidered some of the things that are unacceptable. Birmingham Royal Ballet reworked its Chinese variation last year after removing yellow makeup from the costume in 2018. There’s the Arabian dance too – you can’t change one and not the other – and this year BRB have also removed the darker makeup that was once required for the men in the Arabian dance. Having these conversations eliminates the hysteria around change and makes us understand that these things need to be considered.My whole career has been in England and I have never experienced any discrimination because of my colour. But the same isn’t true for some other dancers in other countries. I’ve seen complaints about dancers not being promoted and so on. At BRB we have quite a erse company, I think we’re definitely leading the way in that sense.Ballet was created as a white, elitist art form, but we can’t be boxed in by views from the past. Back then they never would have thought it would touch dancers from the Caribbean, like myself. If you look at the number of countries the dancers in BRB come from, it’s amazing. We’ve grown. And all audiences need to be accepting of the change. We need to be looking at talent, rather than colour.Soloist at New York City Ballet, aka The Rogue Ballerina, co-founder of Final Bow for YellowfaceI’m Filipino American and I’m the first Asian woman ever promoted out of the corps de ballet at New York City Ballet. I didn’t know how hard this trajectory would be, to push back on a bias held for generations. It has required so much extra work and trauma, I’ve had to prove my talent is undeniable in every aspect.I’ve had the experience of being made to feel “other”. My first experience of feeling uncomfortable was performing the Chinese ertissement in George Balanchine’s Nutcracker, prior to its recent adaptation. I put on the wig, I was made to accentuate my already Asian features. I was 21 or 22, I didn’t have the wherewithal to explain it, I just knew that this wasn’t right. Certainly at that point nobody could go up to Peter Martins and say: “Excuse me, this is racist.” So I just ended up making a caricature out of the caricature. Everything that was so offensive, the fan, the nodding head, I used humour to deal with it. At one point I bobbed my head so hard I lost my wig.I’m now known for dancing Coffee, the “Arabian” variation in Nutcracker. How do I feel about that? Depending on which production you’re viewing, it’s a very fine line. It is exoticising, it feeds into orientalism, but the dance can be flipped into a powerful statement about what it is to be a woman. I’ve made it my choice to step into my sensuality and make it athletic, not just sexy. I always feel very empowered when I’m dancing Coffee.In the past couple of years I’ve been part of the ersity initiative at City Ballet. I want to encourage dancers to find ways to advocate for themselves. Ballet dancers, especially women, are made to feel like we are replaceable. We feel that if we speak up it’s going to be used against us – and sometimes it is. But the more dancers speak up, the more we’re going to change that. You can’t expect someone to grasp your lens of experience, especially when it comes to most white male directors. I say this with utmost respect to men, but the white male gaze has dominated decision-making in the ballet world. We as dancers are accountable for asking questions of our leaders because no matter what our gender or race or intentions, we all have blind spots.As society’s views change, ballet has to adapt. We’re slow on the uptake in a lot of different ways – our full length ballets mostly feature an outdated power dynamic. It doesn’t take much to remove the offensiveness. There are a lot of traditionalists who think tinkering with anything is blasphemy. But removing brownface from Bayadère is not ruining the ballet. It’s simply employing your suspension of disbelief.We’re at a breaking point with humanity. We have to really try to see each other. I think ballet is a conduit for inspiring that connection. Even though I’m on stage I have a direct connection to the audience. It’s different to visiting a museum, it’s very much a present art, an actual physical exchange between the dancers and the audience. That’s where the magic of ballet is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf06cbd132c7c372c2e1a002ac056455f74cacab/0_111_1811_1087/master/1811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd571ca2ca9336d77456490c1d268f42","title":"sitcoms broadway musicals","story":"News that long-running sitcom The Nanny is headed to the stage, with help from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s Rachel Bloom, brings to mind other potential transfersIt’s easy to forget what a successful sitcom The Nanny was back in the 1990s. It won an Emmy and a Rose D’Or. It was the subject of a reunion special just five years after it went off the air. It has been remade countless times around the world as Dadi in Turkey, La Tata in Italy and My Fair Nanny in Russia. So the news that The Nanny will soon become a Broadway musical makes perfect sense.Creators Fran Drescher and Peter Marc Jacobson announced the project yesterday, with the pair writing the new show’s book and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s Rachel Bloom and Adam Schlesinger hired to write the songs. And while this might be premature, I think it could work. On TV, intentionally or otherwise, The Nanny always had a slightly unworldly quality to it, and a sense of self-awareness that drifted back and forth from total sincerity to flat-out fourth-wall-breaking. It always felt like more of a live performance than a fully realised sitcom, and so it might turn out that Broadway is its natural home.And if that’s the case, the floodgates will open. Every sitcom you ever heard of will be rushing out its own version of a Broadway musical. That isn’t to say that they should, however. Here are three sitcoms that deserve a musical, and three that absolutely do not.Cheers was the perfect sitcom, and the elements that made it perfect would easily translate to the stage. It’s primarily set in one location, for example, which would keep costs down. There’s enough chemistry between Sam and Diane to underpin the requisite emotional stakes. And best of all, each character is distinct enough to carry at least one song. Frasier could get a fuddy duddy Gilbert and Sullivan patter number. Carla could grouch out something aggressive. And then there’s Cliff, by far the most suitable candidate for an Andrew Lloyd-Webber-style torch song about a life squandered.Should it be a musical? YesIf you remember 30 Rock’s insistence on occasionally meandering into the flabby wastelands of its live episodes, you’ll understand why it should never be let anywhere near a theatre. 30 Rock is a great sitcom, and it has great incidental music, but its charm came from its speed and snappy editing. The live episodes were slower and far less precise, and you can easily imagine that this would translate to a Broadway musical. Unless it’s just 90 minutes of people singing Werewolf Bar Mitzvah, in which case sign me up.Should it be a musical? NoNow, this is a bit of a cheat, because It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has already sort of received the musical treatment. In 2009 it adapted the classic music-heavy episode The Nightman Cometh into a 45-minute live show that toured around six American cities. The results, by all accounts were fantastic. The fact that it isn’t already a Broadway musical actively makes me angry.Should it be a musical? YesThere might be a musical in Saved by the Bell. If nothing else, Jessie Spano’s caffeine pill-induced freakout performance of I’m So Excited could be expanded into a full-blown number complete with a lightshow and dancing girls. However, just because it’s feasible, it doesn’t mean that a Saved by the Bell musical should actually happen. Think of the crowds they would have to perform to. Wave after wave of ironic fortysomethings all dressed in bad clothes and whooping at Mr Belding. The cast would be drained of all their spirit by the second performance.Should it be a musical? NoA perfect candidate for a Broadway musical because every single episode was ultimately identical. A woman is a witch. Her husband doesn’t want her to use her powers. His mother-in-law, enraged by his oppressive hold over her daughter, causes a magical mishap. The woman fixes it with magic to appease her bully of a husband. Everyone is happy again. What a perfect, universal lesson for everyone.Should it be a musical? YesA Friends musical would arguably be the most successful musical in the history of the world, given the sustained popularity of it as a television series. It would make money hand over fist regardless of quality. But would it be a worthwhile enterprise? Would it further the evolution of a noble art form while attempting to say something new about the human condition? Or would it just be loads of people in dated wigs singing songs called Pivot and We Were On A Break?Should it be a musical? No. But will it be? Probably"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8d0401705de3604b259ffa337bdc5aa1eafb153/0_80_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7db3ff398e6343cea04649ffdc27b9c6","title":"florida voting rights felons amendement 4","story":"Amendment 4 should restore the vote to 1.4 million people. But those affected say the struggle is far from overOne year ago, Florida enacted the biggest expansion of the right to vote in America in a generation.For 150 years, Florida had upheld a law that banned anyone convicted of a felony from voting, even after they had served the full sentence. The policy, rooted in the Jim Crow south, stood out as a stain on American democracy.But with majority support, Florida enacted Amendment 4, which allows anyone convicted of a felony to vote once they complete their sentence (those convicted of murder and sexual offenses still can’t vote) on 8 January 2019. This policy would re-enfranchise 1.4 million people – one of the biggest expansions of voting rights since the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the most significant in this generation. spoke to five Florida residents directly affected by or involved with Amendment 4. Some had just registered to vote for the first time in their lives, others struggled with the continued trials of being incarcerated. Their stories tell of last year’s victory and the difficulties of undoing decades of systemic inequality.Until 2019, Derrick McGregor had never been inside a voting booth. The only ballot he had ever seen was in school lessons.McGregor lost his voting rights when he was 18 and convicted of a felony for attempted burglary. When he was released, he worked hard to set up a new life, opening up an accounting business. But he couldn’t vote.“It’s almost like when you do something wrong, paying the time for it is just not enough for society. They want to keep you bound after that and almost chain you up and close your mouth,” he said.McGregor voted for the first time in his local election in Orlando last year. “Before I never really felt like I had a voice,” he said.New voters like McGregor could prove pivotal in this year’s election. Political races in Florida are often decided by razor-thin margins.McGregor, however, is as interested in influencing local races as national ones. “I realized my vote will count, and it will make a difference, especially where I live.”The driving force behind Amendment 4 was a group of former felons who knew what it felt like to be disenfranchised. Desmond Meade was a leader of this movement.In 2001, Meade was convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon and sentenced to three years in prison. After his release he found himself at rock bottom – he thought about killing himself. Instead, he checked himself drug addiction treatment, stayed at a homeless shelter and enrolled in classes. He graduated from law school just a few years later.In 2009, Meade became head of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an advocacy group for former felons that would push Amendment 4 to the 2018 midterm election.When it passed, Meade and his colleagues didn’t slow down. The coalition has undertaken the nitty-gritty work of making sure people understand and use Amendment 4. They travel across the state by bus, teaching people about Amendment 4, and have hired people with felony convictions to register voters.He estimates that more than 50,000 people with felonies have registered to vote over the last year. One of them, he said, last voted for John F Kennedy. “To be able to see them to be able to register to vote was an amazing thing,” Meade said.Civil rights groups called the measure an unconstitutional poll tax, historically used to keep African Americans from the polls. They went to court last October. But while the judge ruled in favor of the 17 former felons in the case, the rest remain limited by the law.Meade himself registered to vote for the first time on 8 January 2019 with his family.“When I went in and I registered and I came out and there was a celebration going on … I finally felt like I was fully an American citizen,” he said.Amendment 4 was a historic policy, but the 1.4 million people who gained access to the polls might not actually make it to the election.Paul Lux is one of the state’s 67 state supervisors of elections. He said after the policy was passed, he and other officials didn’t have clarity about who was eligible to vote and how to verify that information. Florida also had yet to clarify which crimes were exempt from the rule.That confusion hasn’t subsided. “It is for all intents and purposes no less ambiguous than it was a year ago,” Lux said.As the state approaches the presidential primaries, this gray area could play out at the polls, Lux said, pushing Republicans and Democrats to challenge voter eligibility.The lack of information could also be harmful to voters, and Lux said some people have already hesitated to register. With deadlines ahead, Lux predicted there would be a flood of questions.“I hope it doesn’t preclude anyone who thinks they’re eligible from registering and voting,” he said.Amendment 4 restored voting rights to many people, but it hasn’t restored all rights to those with felony convictions.Last year, Tyrone Oliver, who runs a not-for-profit organization in Ocala, ran for city council and won. The celebration was short lived: after he was elected, a city attorney informed Oliver he wasn’t allowed to hold office because of a felony conviction from over 30 years ago.Oliver was stunned. The drug-related felony had cost him three months of life, three years of probation, and his voting rights for decades. But he thought that Amendment 4 had restored all his rights, including the ability to hold office.“This system dropped the ball and I’m paying for it,” he said. “They’re still beating me over the head with something that happened when I was 26 years old and I’m 63 now.”Since then, he’s been trying to meet Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, to discuss the issue.His ordeal has made Oliver ambivalent about Amendment 4 as well. He thinks the measure was “not good” for Florida because it created confusion.“I have been publicly embarrassed. News stations and everybody comes out that I’m a convicted felon and all this stuff. And nobody bothers to ask me the whole story,” he said.While Amendment 4 passed with support from most Floridians, there’s still work to be done to combat the stigma around people with felony convictions. Lance Wissinger wants to be part of the solution.Wissinger wanted to be the first person to register to vote at the Lee county election office the day Amendment 4 went into effect. But by the time he got there, around 9am, someone had already beat him.Wissinger has never voted. He was convicted of DUI manslaughter and served four and a half years in prison in the mid-2000s. When he was released, Wissinger said he wanted to get more involved in his community.Last year he started as a policy fellow with the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, where, like Meade, he has been trying to inform as many people as possible about their right to vote. “I’ve gone out and knocked on doors and I tell people: ‘Hey, I’m just seeing if you want to register to vote.’ And they’re like ‘I can’t, I’m a felon.’ I’m like: ‘You can now,’” he said.It can be difficult for people to figure out if their sentences are fully completed. The law Republicans passed last year allows courts to change sentences, and replace fines and fees with community service hours. But so far just four counties in the state, all Democratic-leaning, are utilizing the provision.Meanwhile, Wissinger hopes to change the general perception of what felons look like, and who benefits from Amendment 4.“People will be like: ‘Well, you had a chance and you screwed that up.’ Not knowing and not understanding is a lot of why I go and speak and tell my story,” he said. “I didn’t know how big of a deal it was until it personally affected me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d4dcabda5ed894b173f39b7c69e83b07b942799/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7967a9b39a714c08a31897291aa91345","title":"mexico asylum seeker refused us entry","story":"Man who has not been identified had attempted to cross from Reynosa into Pharr, Texas, on WednesdayA Mexican asylum seeker has taken his own life on a bridge across the Rio Grande after being refused entry to the US, in an incident highlighting the often desperate plights of those being turned away by Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration.The man, who was reportedly in his 30s and has not been identified, had attempted to cross from the Mexican city of Reynosa into Pharr, Texas, on Wednesday afternoon. But he was turned back on the international bridge and shortly after 5pm cut his own throat.Footage published by the local El Mañana de Reynosa newspaper showed armed Mexican police sealing off the area where the man’s body had fallen as cars and lorries continued to advance over the bridge.There was no immediate suggestion why the man had decided to take his own life but local authorities said they were investigating.The incident was not the first of its kind. In 2017, a 45-year-old Mexican migrant named Guadalupe Olivas Valencia jumped to his death in Tijuana less than an hour after being “repatriated” from the US.Olivas Valencia had reportedly been working illegally as a gardener in California to support his three children back in Mexico when he was deported.This week’s suicide again cast a light on the bleak conditions facing the growing number of migrants being turned away from the US’s southern border and the dangers facing them back home, in crime-ridden communities in Central America and Mexico.In the past year, more than 57,000 asylum seekers have been pushed back into Mexico as part of a Trump administration scheme called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) project, or Remain in Mexico.Activists claim the initiative is endangering vulnerable asylum seekers by forcing them to wait months for court hearings in some of Mexico’s most dangerous border towns.Last month the advocacy group Human Rights First accused the White House of exposing asylum seekers to “life-threatening dangers” after documenting 636 cases of kidnapping, rape, torture, assault and other violent attacks against those returned to Mexico.Among the victims were a nine-year-old disabled girl and her mother, who were kidnapped and raped after being sent back to Tijuana.The Human Rights First researcher Kennji Kizuka said that with schemes such as Remain in Mexico the Trump administration was moving “to essentially shut down asylum and refugee access to the United States”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e70f0c054037f859b5e0c6f7074607185240b6/907_81_3377_2026/master/3377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d7dc72c59376de6886607a935aa4739","title":"uk accused of behaving like cowboys over eu database copying","story":"Dutch Liberal MEP Sophie in ’t Veld says leaked report revealed ‘violations and abuse’The British government has been accused of “behaving like a bunch of cowboys” after a confidential report revealed it had allowed illegal copying of an EU database.The issue, discussed publicly for the first time on Thursday, threatens to sour talks on the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU, despite hopes on both sides for close ties in fighting crime and terrorism.Sophie in ’t Veld, a Dutch liberal MEP, told the European parliament’s justice and home affairs committee that a leaked EU report revealed “deliberate violations and abuse” by the UK of the Schengen Information System, a vast database used by police and border guards across the EU’s border-free Schengen zone.While the UK is not a member of the border-free travel area, it has negotiated access to the database, where authorities across Europe share more than 76m items of information on criminal suspects, missing people or contraband goods.“This is a country that is not a member of Schengen because it doesn’t want to be a member of Schengen,” In ’t Veld told MEPs. “It doesn’t want to be a member of the European Union. Nevertheless, in the kindness of our hearts we have given them access to the Schengen Information System and they behaved like a bunch of cowboys.”The MEP, who has tabled a complaint to the European commission, said “one of the most astonishing” features of the leaked report was “the lack of reciprocity” from British authorities to act in the interest of EU counterparts.The leaked EU report states that British border guards only act on alerts “the UK considers to be important”, meaning some checks on people and documents requested by other member states are not carried out. Another charge is that the UK “does not always take action” if someone wanted for arrest is leaving the UK. British police, according to the report, are trained only to seize contraband goods relating to crimes committed on UK soil, not those in other EU member states.The document, first reported by the EUObserver website in 2018, is based on visits by EU inspectors to 22 sites, including politan police HQ, Heathrow airport and the Folkestone checkpoint. Nine of the total were surprise visits to police units across the UK, as well as British Transport police.Following those visits in November 2017, the EU concluded that British authorities had made “unlawful” full or partial copies of the SIS database. The report said “major deficiencies in the legal, operational and technical implementation of SIS” in the UK that had not been remedied, despite concerns first raised in 2015. The litany of problems pose “serious and immediate risks to the integrity and security of SIS data”.An official responsible for information systems, borders and security at the European commission’s Home Directorate, Marc Sulon, told MEPs that an evaluation on how to respond to the report’s findings was put “temporarily on hold in October 2018” because of Brexit negotiations and no-deal planning.EU member states, he said, had decided in June 2018 not to disconnect the UK from the database but give British authorities “the opportunity to propose a plan for remedial action”. The commission’s evaluation had resumed as the UK would remain part of the database until at least the end of 2020 under the Brexit transition period.Sulon dismissed claims that the US government had access to the EU database via the UK’s illegal copies. US companies working for the UK government are suspected to have made the copies, but Sulon said the rules allowed “cooperation with contractors … subject to compliance with all provisions of the legislation”.MEPs reacted with fury to the commission’s handling of the affair, including a missed deadline to respond to a European parliament question raising the alarm. Calling for an inquiry, an Irish independent MEP, Clare Daly, highlighted concerns from the commission that “other member states have challenges in this area”. She said: “I think the commission needs to come clean about how bad things actually are.”The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Wednesday reiterated her call for “a new comprehensive security partnership” between the EU and the UK “to fight cross-border threats, ranging from terrorism to cybersecurity to counter-intelligence”.But any wide-ranging agreement on data-sharing will almost certainly have to be approved by the European parliament.A UK government spokesperson said: “We have some of the highest levels of data protection safeguards globally and are fully committed to meeting our legal obligations. We have a very close security partnership with EU countries, providing information on thousands of alerts every year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02f978f83f6e9d7a07e573e3b1a55e01b3a241ec/0_197_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b54acd843d7dc4a6fe7ae547a8e2a82","title":"puerto rico earthquake in pictures","story":"Homes collapsed, power was knocked out and at least one person died after Tuesday’s 6.4-magnitude quake and powerful aftershocks.

In an address to the Institute of International and European Affairs think tank, Ms Fox said that despite warnings about Brexit undermining the Northern Irish peace process and reigniting political violence, it was actually changing Northern Ireland’s electoral geography.“Brexit has acted as a catalyst encouraging more people to think and vote outside of traditional party loyalties,” said Ms Fox, who was elected to the European Parliament last year.“In other words, I think a lot of the consequences of Brexit are a good thing, because I think that the status quo, as it was, and the political status quo, as it was, was not good enough.”Ms Fox later said she was referring to the increase in vote for the centrist Alliance Party and the decline of the DUP in December’s general election as “some positive aspects” of Brexit rather than “scare-mongering” about the impact of UK’s exit on Northern Ireland. DeadlineThe Brexit Party MEP criticised European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for warning British prime minister Boris Johnson that his deadline of December 31st, 2020, would not provide sufficient time to negotiate a future trade partnership between the EU and the UK.“And I think actually if anything it kind of just reinforces a sense of the EU not accepting the decision and people feel slightly resentful at that.”Ms Fox said the more Ms von der Leyen says this, the “more unhelpful” it would be for Mr Johnson because if he has to ask for an extension, it would look as if he is having to “kowtow to what the EU says.”The MEP, whose parents came from Co Dublin and Co Tipperary, dismissed the view of Brexit being a “far-right phenomenon” and “even a return to the 1930s” as a “caricature, unfair and wrong”.She portrayed the decision to leave the EU as an anti-establishment vote by ordinary people “demanding a reckoning with the political system and confronting a technocratic style of politics”.“Brexit has changed everything in British politics – it has blown open a cosy, zombie-like closed world of Westminster parliamentary politics. It has broken open the traditional line between left and right, which was already an exhausted tradition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4134729.1578600680!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 leaders to meet again after constructive meeting","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin (left) will meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Thursday to discuss the date of the general election.Afterwards, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael issued identical statements.“The two leaders had a constructive meeting. They discussed Dail numbers and possible legislative proposals which could be passed in a further Dail session. “They agreed to consider matters further and to meet again next week.”No major further developments will now be expected until next week.Speaking before the meeting, Mr Varadkar said he believed he could continue in office but acknowledged the Dáil numbers were “very precarious.”However, he declined to answer on three occasions if the Dáil will reconvene on Wednesday after its Christmas recess. The Taoiseach said it was not a yes or no answer. There had been speculation that Mr Varadkar could seek a dissolution before next Wednesday, when the Dáil is due to return after the Christmas break. “The Cabinet is due to meet on Tuesday, the Dáil will be reconvened on Wednesday and that is the position until such time as it may change,” he said.At the post-Cabinet briefing, Mr Varadkar said he believed the Government could continue in office without agreement on an election date with Mr Martin. The Taoiseach also indicated he will speak to smaller parties and groups in the Dáil to see if they will help him continue in office. “It is the case that with Fianna Fáil continuing to abstain that the Government can continue and that we have, I believe, sufficient votes to get our legislative program through. But obviously, the numbers are also very precarious.“I can’t predict the outcome of the conversation I’m going to have with the leader of Fianna Fáil tonight. And it’s not just about Fianna Fail obviously, I need to consult with Fine Gael, with the Independent Alliance with other independent ministers, independents who support the government and indeed, for the parties. So you know, that’s that’s where the situation lies.”He again rejected Mr Martin’s suggestion of an “orderly wind down”. “My strong view, though, is that a government should never be wound down. I’ve heard Micheal Martin use them turn on several occasions, that somehow the government or the Dail would be wound down,” he said.Earlier, Minister for Health Simon Harris has said the timing of an election will be decided by Mr Varadkar in consultation with Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin who are meeting on Thursday evening. Speaking on his way into a Cabinet meeting in Marino, Dublin, Mr Harris also criticised Cork South West TD Michael Collins, whose rural Independent group has said it will table a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health.“I have no confidence in Deputy Michael Collins anyway so it probably won’t come as much of a surprise he wouldn’t have any in me,” Mr Harris said. “He’s spent most of his time in Dáil Éireann opposing measures I was trying to bring forward, most particularly in relation to women’s reproductive health. What is very clear is that the timing of this election will be decided by the Taoiseach in consultation with the leader of the Opposition.“Obviously those talks will get under way today. But one way or another we’re going to have an election in Ireland in the not too distant future and I’m looking forward to having an opportunity during that election of putting forward our vision for the health service and for the country as a whole.”The leader of the Rural Independent Group of TDs, Mattie McGrath, has said he supports colleague Mr Collins’s proposal for a motion of no confidence in Minister for Health Simon Harris. “I haven’t had confidence in Simon Harris in a long time,” he told RTÉ radio’s Today with Séan O’Rourke show.Mr Harris also criticised Fianna Fáil’s record in government. “If you look at all economic indicators in this country we’re going in the right direction. We’ve many challenges, every country has but in Leo Varadkar we have the right leader to steer the ship, get us through this phase of Brexit, the next phase of Brexit and there’s some crucial work going on with Simon Coveney as well in Northern Ireland today. So we have a busy programme of work to do and at some point in the not too distant future we’ll ask the people to renew that mandate.”Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin meet in Dublin on Thursday evening amid mounting speculation the general election will be held next month. The leaders will discuss the conclusion of the confidence-and-supply deal between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and the date of the next election. The deal struck in 2016 kept the minority Fine Gael-led Government in power as Fianna Fáil agreed to abstain in key Dáil votes. Speculation in Fine Gael is growing the Taoiseach may call a snap election for next month, with either February 7th or 14th widely mooted by TDs. Mr Varadkar, however, has largely kept his counsel in public and in private.In recent days, Mr Martin has said there is “no question” of his party voting for the Government as requested by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who has asked Mr Martin to support the Government in some Dáil votes if there is to be an agreed election date.However, Mr Martin told Newstalk he would not change his position that Fianna Fáil would only abstain rather than support the Government on certain votes. It sets up a confrontation between the pair at their meeting on Thursday night.“There is no question of Fianna Fáil taking that position, he knows that,” Mr Martin said, adding Mr Varadkar should seek the support of Independents or smaller parties if he needed to make up the numbers in the Dáil.MotionMr Collins said there will be an opportunity to put forward the motion at the end of January or in early February, he added. “I am hopeful that any self-respecting politician will support this motion. I think it would be carried.”Mr Collins said the Minister for Health had presided over a “major crisis in the health service” with elective surgeries being cancelled, record numbers on trolleys, a recruitment embargo, delayed discharges and the “highest ever” waiting lists.“Somebody must be accountable for all this.”Mr McGrath described discussions between Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin as “unseemly”, and he urged them to “throw in the towel”. Mr Collins, a Cork South-West TD, said he and Danny Healy-Rae had returned from Belfast earlier this week with the 51st group of patients from the southwest who had cataract surgery in Northern Ireland rather than remain on waiting lists. When asked if he was ready for a general election if the motion of no confidence was successful, Mr Collins said: “it is up to Leo if an election is needed or not. Simon Harris is not functioning as a Minister. If that means a general election then so be it.”The time of year was not an issue, he said, as preparations had already begun. “It’s already started.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNo one paper emerged as sympathetic to Prince Harry and Markle, although some were reserved in their assessments. File photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPA  Several British national newspapers have launched blistering attacks on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – after their decision on Wednesday to step away from royal life, saying they had shown no understanding of what their roles entailed, and had been disrespectful to Queen Elizabeth.No paper emerged as sympathetic to Prince Harry and Ms Markle, although some were reserved in their assessments, arguing the desire for less scrutiny by splitting their time on both sides of the Atlantic might have been understandable, especially since the birth of son Archie.But others were far more scathing.The Daily Mirror, one of three papers facing lawsuits from the couple, fumed in its coverage about “an extraordinary day in the history of the royal family”. One comment piece in particular pulled no punches.“And he didn’t even have the guts or decency to tell her, or his own father, of the bombshell he was about to drop in their laps.”“Well, good riddance,” Bletchly added. “I for one have had a bellyful of Harry’s eco-warrior hypocrisy.“The tragedy is he was once the most loved of the modern royals — from the moment he walked behind his mother’s coffin our hearts ached for him. Then he met Meghan. But boy, she changed our Harry.”The left-leaning Mirror’s main editorial was more more tempered, but did round on the couple for not first informing the queen or other family members.“It shows shocking disregard for a woman whose entire life has been ruled by a sense of public duty and honour,” the editorial said. “This is also enormously hurtful to Harry’s father and brother, our future kings.”The Daily Mail — whose sister publication the Mail on Sunday is also being sued by the couple — devoted its first 17 pages to the “astonishing statement” by the “rogue royals”.Veteran columnist AN Wilson termed their exclusion of the queen “an atrocious lapse of judgement”, although he added the “abdication” would strengthen the institution of the monarchy.“The truth is that this charming, intelligent, beautiful woman hadn’t a clue what the monarchy really is, or what role minor members of the Royal Family have to play in public life,” Wilson wrote of Ms Markle.“For his part, Harry perhaps didn’t fully understand his own role as a younger son. Both seemed oblivious to the fact that the British monarchy is a delicate constitutional miracle, not a vehicle for its members to press home their views on the subjects that interest them, however noble.”He said the couple would now be free of “the awkward sense that you have no clear role to play in British public life”.Mail columnist Sarah Vine said the couple had “hardly had a chance to understand what the job really entails before handing in their resignation”.“It’s almost as though they never really had any intention of trying to stick it out at all, as though right from the start the notion was always there in the back of their minds that if life as Duke and Duchess didn’t live up to expectation, they would simply leave,” she wrote.In its main editorial, the Mail said Prince Harry had pressed the “nuclear button” on his royal career, delivering a hammer blow to the queen, his family, and the monarchy, and tossing years of goodwill built up since the death of his mother Diana “into the hazard”.“To them, it is ‘an exciting next step’. To most of us, it sounds like having your cake and eating it. They want the status of being ‘senior’ Royals but the privacy and freedom of being private citizens,” the editorial said.The  was relatively placid in its editorial, aside from highlighting the lack of family consultation. Columnist Margaret Holder, however, said the couple had “consistently failed to understand that a tax-paying public expects the Royal Family to be relevant, relatable and value for money”.“In trying to hide the place of Archie’s birth and refusing to name his godparents they pushed aside the public in a way not done by any other royals,” Holder wrote.The Times’ editorial said the announcement carried all the signs of the “petulance and hot-headedness for which Prince Harry is sadly becoming well-known”.“This latest outburst appears to have been triggered in part by anger at recent images released by the Palace that signalled a shift to a more slimmed down monarchy,” it said. “This included a photo of the Queen with Princes Charles, William and George. Yet given Prince Harry’s own publicly aired frustrations with royal life, he can hardly be surprised at his exclusion.”–PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4135241.1578599436!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"harry and meghan s flight from royal embrace not the first","story":"Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams has called Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s decision to announce that they were stepping back from royal duties without consulting Buckingham Palace extraordinarily irresponsible. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,  appear fully prepared to exploit their status commercially. File photograph: Reuters The duke and duchess looked awkward, even pained, as they answered the interviewer’s questions, all of which had been agreed in advance and rehearsed before the live broadcast, along with the answers. While the duke was giving a short monologue about the difficulty of making plans for the future and how it takes care of itself in any case, the duchess patted the side of his head to put a stray hair back in place.The interview was progressing jerkily but without drama until the interviewer surprised the couple with an unscripted question.“Do you ever have occasion to discuss what might have been?” Ed Murrow asked.The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII, shot his wife a frightened look, twisted in the corner of the sofa for a moment and leaned so far forward that his head was almost between his knees as he stared at the floor.“I think you must be referring to the crucial events in my life, in our lives, of 1936 and are wondering whether they have ever preoccupied our minds since that time. Well, the answer is emphatically no,” he said.The duchess, formerly Wallis Simpson, looked away, fidgeted and appeared stricken as he spoke, until she leaned across, laid a hand on his arm and gave him a firm reminder.“Don’t you remember we always said we would never talk about what might have been,” she said.“In fact, I think we arranged that pact on our honeymoon.”Wednesday’s announcement by Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, that they were quitting their roles as senior members of the British royal family has drawn comparisons with the Windsors. Like the earlier duke, Harry is a popular young royal who has put his wife before his role in the family and angered his relations and the establishment around them in doing so.Like the Windsors, the Sussexes are planning to leave Britain – at least for part of the year when they will base themselves in north America, probably in Canada. And like the Duke of Windsor, Harry wants the best of both worlds, retaining his royal title and many of its privileges, including the use of Frogmore Cottage, which was renovated recently at the cost to the public purse of £2.4 million (€2.8 million).Unlike the Windsors, however, the Sussexes are entering their new life voluntarily and with their eyes wide open, fully prepared to exploit their status commercially and sufficiently ruthless to outwit the merciless Buckingham Palace press machine by making their announcement without warning.Their decision has created problems for the royal family, not least because the system does not allow for princes to be semi-royal or to pick and choose among the privileges and duties of their role. Other royals who have tried to make an independent living, including Prince Edward, Princess Michael of Kent and Sarah Ferguson, have quickly become embroiled in conflicts of interest as it was impossible to disentangle their commercial entities from their royal identity.On the other hand, Harry and Meghan were clearly unhappy as senior royals and their departure now should take care of a problem that might otherwise have erupted when Prince Charles succeeds Queen Elizabeth. Charles’s accession will be complicated enough by arguments over the status of his wife Camilla, his desire to put his inidual mark on the monarchy and questions about the legitimacy of the institution after the death of the queen.Harry and Meghan have a powerful network of friends in the US entertainment industry, including Oprah Winfrey, who can help them to find a financially rewarding new role, and the duchess already knows success as an actor. But the adjustment for Harry could prove difficult after a lifetime as what the Duchess of Windsor called a “bell pusher”, who has, apart from his time in the army, always had someone available to answer the bell and give him what he wants.Diana Mosley, one of the Mitford sisters and the wife of the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley, was a close friend of the Windsors when they lived in France. She recalled after his death how the duke eased his homesickness by creating an English garden but how he was unable to find a satisfying role in life after he gave up the one he was born to.“In the winter, when there was no gardening in France, you see they were nearly always in America. Then I think he played a lot of golf. I don’t think he was very good but he liked the exercise,” she said.“Perhaps he’d have played less golf if he’d been in England and he had a few foundation stones to lay or something. But he hadn’t.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Police call for curbs on anonymous pay-as-you-go phones to combat county lines gangs\u0026#39 drug dealingQueen calls Royal family crisis meeting as Harry and Meghan face backlash over breakaway planNorthern Ireland on brink of new deal to restore governmentIran plane crash: Ticket error spared man - but his wife boarded fatal flight from TehranBoris Johnson says Iran shot down Ukrainian plane, possibly by accidentI said to Meghan: \u0026#39Why don\u0026#39t you just jack it all in?\u0026#39 I didn\u0026#39t expect an answer\u0026#39Comment: There\u0026#39s a logic to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s choice – but you can\u0026#39t be half royalMark Pougatch dropped from BBC Radio 5 Live: \u0026#39This was not my decision but on we go\u0026#39Comment: If Scottish Labour support calls for indyref2, it will ignite a furious battle in the party\u0026#39s ranksRelaxed Duchess signals how modern monarchy is safe in Cambridges\u0026#39 handsHelen McCourt\u0026#39s family seek urgent judicial review to prevent release of killer who never revealed location of her bodyHow the royals gave Harry and Meghan everything they wanted - but they still wanted moreAI technology to catch paedophiles grooming children by their use of language launched by GovernmentBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes final stage in Commons Harry and Meghan quit the Firm: The US money makers set to keep funds flowingScottish Labour to make spring decision on backing second independence referendumGovernment accused of \u0026#39avoiding scrutiny\u0026#39 by giving MPs a month’s more holidayThe last week that led Harry and Meghan to press the nuclear button and defy the QueenSNP\u0026#39s flagship broadband pledge running at least two years late, minister admitsComment: Why Britain needs the Brexit Spartans of the ERG now more than everWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"linguistic laziness act cultural self harm","story":"Does it matter if the British can’t speak foreign languages? A new study by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) has warned that our young people are “miles behind” those of any other European country when it comes to second languages.Only 32 per cent of Britons aged 15 to 30 feel confident reading and writing in more than one language. (And even this meagre tally is inflated by the “heritage” languages spoken by the children of immigrants.) In Denmark, 99 per cent of young people speak a second language. The EU average is 89 per cent.The British have long been reluctant linguists. PG Wodehouse observed, 85 years ago, the “look of furtive shame, the shifty, hangdog look which announces that an Englishman is about to talk French”. But at least, back then, speaking French was something an Englishman felt he ought to do. Today, we have almost completely abandoned the attempt.The reasons for this are both specific and general. In 2004, the New Labour government decided that languages should no longer be compulsory at GCSE level. This led to a precipitous fall in uptake: fewer than half of English schoolchildren now take a GCSE in foreign languages, compared to 76 per cent in 2002.One could argue that New Labour was merely being pragmatic. Why bother with the difficult, time-consuming process of learning a foreign language, when the whole world already speaks ours? English is the most successful language in history: almost 400 million people speak English as a first language, and a billion more as a second. The British Empire, followed by America’s cultural dominion, has left us with the singular blessing of being understood almost everywhere on earth, from Gdansk to Gujarat.With so much else to cram into the school day, from robotics to bicycle safety to “British values”, it makes sense to cast off the subjects we don’t need. Should you, in future, require a quill for your aunt, Google Translate can supply the words.And yet – there is more to education than strict utility. Despite being a linguist of the Wodehouse school myself, so stricken with embarrassment that I can’t even order un café au lait without sounding ironic, I do want my children to speak another language. Ideally French, to help them better understand our long and intimate history with our closest neighbours.A language is a tapestry whose threads are spun from stories: how the cows raised by Anglo-Saxon peasants became boeuf (and then beef) when eaten by the Norman gentry how the word mortgage derives, with fitting gloom, from the Norman for “death-pledge” how the warning cry of “Prenez garde a l’eau!”, as chamber pots were emptied from high windows, was modified by the British into “gardyloo” and then to “loo”.These stories are seldom told in schools, alas but at least if you understand the basics of French, you can follow the threads yourself. A little knowledge can make sense of all sorts of mysteries, from pub signs to the names of Kentish towns, or the digressions into French that litter all novels written before the 21st century.Abandoning the Romance languages – having already given up on Latin and Greek – means cutting ourselves off from our own linguistic heritage. Like our growing ignorance of the Bible, it marks the point where laziness becomes an act of cultural self-harm.Police call for curbs on anonymous pay-as-you-go phones to combat county lines gangs\u0026#39 drug dealingQueen calls Royal family crisis meeting as Harry and Meghan face backlash over breakaway planNorthern Ireland on brink of new deal to restore governmentIran plane crash: Ticket error spared man - but his wife boarded fatal flight from TehranBoris Johnson says Iran shot down Ukrainian plane, possibly by accidentComment: If Scottish Labour support calls for indyref2, it will ignite a furious battle in the party\u0026#39s ranksComment: There\u0026#39s a logic to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s choice – but you can\u0026#39t be half royalMark Pougatch dropped from BBC Radio 5 Live: \u0026#39This was not my decision but on we go\u0026#39I said to Meghan: \u0026#39Why don\u0026#39t you just jack it all in?\u0026#39 I didn\u0026#39t expect an answer\u0026#39Relaxed Duchess signals how modern monarchy is safe in Cambridges\u0026#39 handsHelen McCourt\u0026#39s family seek urgent judicial review to prevent release of killer who never revealed location of her bodyHow the royals gave Harry and Meghan everything they wanted - but they still wanted moreAI technology to catch paedophiles grooming children by their use of language launched by GovernmentBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes final stage in Commons Harry and Meghan quit the Firm: The US money makers set to keep funds flowingScottish Labour to make spring decision on backing second independence referendumGovernment accused of \u0026#39avoiding scrutiny\u0026#39 by giving MPs a month’s more holidayThe last week that led Harry and Meghan to press the nuclear button and defy the QueenSNP\u0026#39s flagship broadband pledge running at least two years late, minister admitsComment: Harry and Meghan picked the worst week of the year to hand in their notice We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/09/TELEMMGLPICT000220834679_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1jEdJGp1DKo6SYFsq2yafzmIdRm8QnlJjKVAV6wGVNw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"logic harry meghans choice cant half royal","story":"If they’re willing to pay their own way, others have shown it’s possible to achieve a low-key lifePrince Harry has always been more of a Spencer than a Windsor, always more of a hothead than his brother. His petulant declaration of independence is a shock – but not really a surprise. The job of every Royal family member is to support the Queen, to play second, third or fourth fiddle – and it’s not a job for everyone. As Harry himself has said, the monarchy needs to change. Prince Charles proposed a slimmed-down Royal family and now his younger son has obliged. It is unprecedented, even outrageous. But it does make a lot of sense.Read Fraser Nelson\u0027s latest column on telegraph every Thursday night from 9.30pm   For years, Harry has been open about wanting a quieter life further from the public eye. In the Army, “I wasn’t a prince,” he once said, wistfully. “Just Harry.” Meghan, his wife, has been similarly frank about how hard she is finding life in the firm. She tried to adopt the English stiff upper-lip, she said recently, but found it unbearable.The couple’s attempts to dodge and even sue the press pointed to a far bigger blow-up coming further down the track. The “stiff upper lip” that the Duchess of Sussex refers to is seen, by many others, as royal duty. The Queen’s extraordinary self-discipline and devotion to the job explains why her reign has been one of the most successful in British history, in an era when other monarchies have been consumed by egotism or scandal. \u0026#39The Duchess has been frank about finding life tough in the Firm\u0026#39A modern royal must be wary of private jets, billionaire playboys and libidinous financiers. Every day is lived in the public eye, every step closely followed. The idea of being king seemed to make Harry shudder: what royal, he once asked, actually wants the throne?Prince Charles has talked about slimming down the number of people paid for royal duties. So Prince Harry has simply taken his father’s downsizing plan to its logical next step. If there is to be royal pruning, what role for the sixth-in-line to the throne? If he dislikes living inside what he calls “the goldfish bowl”, as most of us would, then why hang around? His glitzy new website makes his argument pretty clearly: he wants to start earning a living, use less taxpayers’ money and ide his time between Britain and Canada.It’s easy to see how his plan could go badly wrong. What if he ends up debasing himself and his family by running errands for sheikhs and oligarchs, pursuing the same gravy trains as Tony Blair? But this depends on how much money he’ll need.If they’re returning to Toronto, where the Duchess of Sussex lived while making her name as an actress, they’ll find money going further than it does in London. She’ll have no end of offers, he could be an adviser to a company specialising in one of his various interests. Money follows celebrity pretty quickly over there, not all of it made shamelessly.Comparisons to the Duke of Windsor’s self-imposed exile in Paris are inevitable, but pointless. There is a better, current day example: Princess Madeleine of Sweden, whose life has mirrored that of Prince Harry. Like him, she grew up third-in-line to the throne. She endured the media spotlight and, like him, ended up marrying a rich American. Her older sister, the Crown Princess, is now married with her own heir and a spare.A few years ago, Madeleine moved to Florida with her husband and now lives the quasi-royal life that Harry seems to be aiming for. The Swedes were taken aback at first, but saw the logic. Her children have forfeited the title “royal highness”, and their family expenses are not covered by the Royal Grant. Princess Madeleine is still a regular in Sweden, turning up for summer holidays, award ceremonies and Nobel dinners. She offers a case study in how to exit a modern monarchy – a route that Prince Andrew should perhaps have taken long ago.It seems that Harry wants all of the above, but the problem is the money. He still wants it, and he describes the development of his own career as an ambition. Here lies the problem. With public money comes public scrutiny, and it’s hard to find a third way.It’s quite understandable for him to want to be a private citizen. But also understandable for the Queen to ask that he would then cover most of his own costs. He seems all geared up to go solo, even if his “Sussex Royal” website sounds more like a brand of cider than a court. But if he’s relying on his family’s finance, he’ll have to take his family’s advice and do everything with their agreement.Had he gone to the Queen with his plan earlier, they could have had this conversation. Work out the plan first, she’d have told him, then think about launching it. As things stand, we might see what looks like a royal orce battle: he wants to keep his patronages and his titles, he’d like to keep the use of Frogmore Cottage, recently refurbished with a £2.4 million budget. But he still seeks the benefits of being a private citizen, while communicating with the outside world via Instagram.This poses obvious problems. How to carry on as members of the Royal family while being separate from the Royal household? How do they plan to support – or, as their website puts it “collaborate with” – the Queen, and on what terms? Buckingham Palace will now have to counter-offer, and the wrangling won’t be edifying. Especially as its response will be fairly straightforward.A private life is on the cards, but it will have to be funded by a private income. Prince Harry is worth some £30 million (mainly through inheritance) – a pretty decent starting point for starting a new life abroad. If the Sussexes can restrict their budget to that of a Toronto multimillionaire, rather than Manhattan billionaire, it’s all doable. It just takes planning – and more patience than he has shown so far.The worst option, of course, was for Prince Harry to go rogue while still a full member of the household, which is how things had seemed. So in a way, he’s right to force the issue. A slimmed-down royal family will need an exit mechanism for those members seeking a private life: others may follow his path. Princess Madeleine has shown that the public don’t begrudge their more junior royals a quiet, lower-budget life in America. The question for Prince Harry is whether this is really an option that he can bring himself to choose.Read Fraser Nelson\u0027s latest column on telegraph every Thursday night from 9.30pm  Duchess of SussexDuke of SussexPolice call for curbs on anonymous pay-as-you-go phones to combat county lines gangs\u0026#39 drug dealingQueen calls Royal family crisis meeting as Harry and Meghan face backlash over breakaway planNorthern Ireland on brink of new deal to restore governmentIran plane crash: Ticket error spared man - but his wife boarded fatal flight from TehranBoris Johnson says Iran shot down Ukrainian plane, possibly by accidentI said to Meghan: \u0026#39Why don\u0026#39t you just jack it all in?\u0026#39 I didn\u0026#39t expect an answer\u0026#39Mark Pougatch dropped from BBC Radio 5 Live: \u0026#39This was not my decision but on we go\u0026#39Comment: If Scottish Labour support calls for indyref2, it will ignite a furious battle in the party\u0026#39s ranksRelaxed Duchess signals how modern monarchy is safe in Cambridges\u0026#39 handsHelen McCourt\u0026#39s family seek urgent judicial review to prevent release of killer who never revealed location of her bodyHow the royals gave Harry and Meghan everything they wanted - but they still wanted moreAI technology to catch paedophiles grooming children by their use of language launched by GovernmentBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes final stage in Commons Harry and Meghan quit the Firm: The US money makers set to keep funds flowingScottish Labour to make spring decision on backing second independence referendumGovernment accused of \u0026#39avoiding scrutiny\u0026#39 by giving MPs a month’s more holidayThe last week that led Harry and Meghan to press the nuclear button and defy the QueenSNP\u0026#39s flagship broadband pledge running at least two years late, minister admitsComment: Why Britain needs the Brexit Spartans of the ERG now more than everComment: Harry and Meghan picked the worst week of the year to hand in their notice We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/09/TELEMMGLPICT000220837134_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqzZ6ZDwur771IYEd6orrgocVxGtnmaDxs1a-N7l7ZftI.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mark pougatch dropped bbc radio 5 live not decision go","story":"Mark Pougatch spent more than 20 years at BBC Radio 5 LiveArts and Entertainment EditorJobs and employmentMark Pougatch, the veteran sports presenter, has been dropped by BBC 5 Live as the station goes in search of a younger audience.Pougatch has been with 5 Live since its inception in 1994 and was one of its most popular voices, presenting coverage of football, cricket, rugby and major sporting events.The BBC said in a statement: “Mark is a brilliant broadcaster who has been an integral part of 5 Live Sport for years. Recently he has been presenting fewer programmes because his other commitments have grown and he has now decided to move on. We wish him well.”But that statement was contradicted by Pougatch, who clarified that he had wanted to stay with the station. He told his followers on social media: “Just so we’re clear this was not my decision but on we go.”It is understood that 5 Live bosses told Pougatch, 51, that there was no longer any work available for him. He was last heard on the station during the Champions League Final in June.5 Live listeners were up in arms on social media, describing the decision as “baffling” and “clueless”. One said that the BBC “seems to be getting rid of the calmer voices who can paint a picture on the radio and replacing them with shouty loud presenters.”Jeff Stelling, the Sky Sports anchor, said: “Sad that his total professionalism will be replaced by someone who is considered to be more in touch with the youth of today, even if they know sod all about football or interviewing. He can’t say it so I will.”Mark Chapman, the BBC sports presenter, praised Pougatch as “a sensational broadcaster with the highest of standards”. AP McCoy, the former jockey, said Pougatch’s exit was a “big loss” for 5 Live.Pougatch maintained that there are no hard feelings. “After an incredibly happy time there I’ve come to the end of the road now at BBC Radio 5 Live,” he said.“For somebody who grew up listening to the radio every Saturday afternoon, and my Dad would clean his shoes to Sports Report at 5 o’clock, to present 5 Live Sport and Sports Report has been a complete privilege and I’m immensely grateful to everybody I’ve worked with.”Pougatch presents on television for BT Sport, and is hosting ITV’s Six Nations coverage. He hopes to find other radio work elsewhere.He is not the only long-serving name to be let go by 5 Live. Cornelius Lysacht, 54, the well-respected horse racing correspondent, was told recently that his services are no longer required. He will leave the station in April.A friend said of Lysacht: “He has so much expertise. He has become the voice of racing. Everyone was shocked when they decided to let him go.”A BBC spokesperson said: “Cornelius is an exceptional racing correspondent who has made an outstanding contribution during his time with the BBC. We’re grateful to him and wish him well for the future. We’ll continue to cover horse racing on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website.”As with all the BBC\u0027s output, 5 Live is trying to skew its output towards a younger, more erse audience.The station has resisted calls to revive Sportsweek, the show that ran for almost 20 years. Instead it is throwing its energies into new output such as The Squad Football Pod, a discussion programme featuring “fans, social media stars, podcasters and absolutely no former players”.Scott Mills, the former Radio 1 breakfast DJ, hosts a new Saturday morning show, while Love Island’s Laura Whitmore is on Sunday mornings.The changes are part of the masterplan devised by James Purnell, the BBC’s director of radio and education, who has made young listeners one of his priorities.In a speech last year he said: “It may mean some surprises, some content that is not for everyone, but to me this only shows how little variety there once was in spoken content on the BBC.“Besides, if the tastes of the younger generation do not offend the sensibilities of their elders, something would seem pretty amiss to me.”Jobs and employmentThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

But there will be a change in some of the  upland landscape that we own.” Hilary McGrady said most of the farmland would come from farms being passed back to the TrustOther initiatives to help the nearly six million member-strong trust achieve net zero emissions include maintaining peat bogs, which like trees absorb and store carbon, investing in more renewable energy, and cutting its carbon footprint.Efforts will focus on the National Trust\u0027s own pollution, but Mrs McGrady acknowledged that the carbon footprint of visitors would not be factored into its carbon zero equations.“We are very conscious that people are travelling to our properties and that is something we want to tackle,” she told a briefing in London. “There is a practical reality, our properties are in rural areas, so that is the reality that you are dealing with, but we are very mindful of it.”The charity, which was founded in the 19th century to protect and care for natural and historic places, also plans to work with other organisations to create ‘green corridors’ that connect people in urban areas to nature.It will also continue work to protect nature, such as clean up rivers and reintroduce species such as water voles and beavers, Mrs McGrady said.A year-long campaign to connect people with nature will include schemes to celebrate Britain\u0027s blossom season, watching dawns for property rooftops and even dancing outdoors.“People need nature now more than ever,” she added.  “If they connect with it then they look after it. We will galvanise the nation to care“And working together is the only way we can reverse the decline in wildlife and the challenges we face due to climate change.“My belief is that civilization, need not, must not, be the enemy of nature. We need a healthy environment.“We will invite people to greet the dawn. We will open rooftops and enable people to gather at viewpoints around the country to watch the sunrise.”Police call for curbs on anonymous pay-as-you-go phones to combat county lines gangs\u0026#39 drug dealingQueen calls Royal family crisis meeting as Harry and Meghan face backlash over breakaway planNorthern Ireland on brink of new deal to restore governmentIran plane crash: Ticket error spared man - but his wife boarded fatal flight from TehranBoris Johnson says Iran shot down Ukrainian plane, possibly by accidentComment: There\u0026#39s a logic to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s choice – but you can\u0026#39t be half royalMark Pougatch dropped from BBC Radio 5 Live: \u0026#39This was not my decision but on we go\u0026#39Comment: If Scottish Labour support calls for indyref2, it will ignite a furious battle in the party\u0026#39s ranksI said to Meghan: \u0026#39Why don\u0026#39t you just jack it all in?\u0026#39 I didn\u0026#39t expect an answer\u0026#39Relaxed Duchess signals how modern monarchy is safe in Cambridges\u0026#39 handsHelen McCourt\u0026#39s family seek urgent judicial review to prevent release of killer who never revealed location of her bodyHow the royals gave Harry and Meghan everything they wanted - but they still wanted moreAI technology to catch paedophiles grooming children by their use of language launched by GovernmentBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes final stage in Commons Harry and Meghan quit the Firm: The US money makers set to keep funds flowingScottish Labour to make spring decision on backing second independence referendumGovernment accused of \u0026#39avoiding scrutiny\u0026#39 by giving MPs a month’s more holidayThe last week that led Harry and Meghan to press the nuclear button and defy the QueenSNP\u0026#39s flagship broadband pledge running at least two years late, minister admitsComment: Harry and Meghan picked the worst week of the year to hand in their notice We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 9 january 2020","story":"Le Corsaire performed by English National Ballet at the London Coliseum (Erina Takahashi as Medora)Police call for curbs on anonymous pay-as-you-go phones to combat county lines gangs\u0026#39 drug dealingQueen calls Royal family crisis meeting as Harry and Meghan face backlash over breakaway planNorthern Ireland on brink of new deal to restore governmentIran plane crash: Ticket error spared man - but his wife boarded fatal flight from TehranBoris Johnson says Iran shot down Ukrainian plane, possibly by accidentComment: There\u0026#39s a logic to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s choice – but you can\u0026#39t be half royalMark Pougatch dropped from BBC Radio 5 Live: \u0026#39This was not my decision but on we go\u0026#39Comment: If Scottish Labour support calls for indyref2, it will ignite a furious battle in the party\u0026#39s ranksI said to Meghan: \u0026#39Why don\u0026#39t you just jack it all in?\u0026#39 I didn\u0026#39t expect an answer\u0026#39Relaxed Duchess signals how modern monarchy is safe in Cambridges\u0026#39 handsHelen McCourt\u0026#39s family seek urgent judicial review to prevent release of killer who never revealed location of her bodyHow the royals gave Harry and Meghan everything they wanted - but they still wanted moreAI technology to catch paedophiles grooming children by their use of language launched by GovernmentBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes final stage in Commons Harry and Meghan quit the Firm: The US money makers set to keep funds flowingScottish Labour to make spring decision on backing second independence referendumGovernment accused of \u0026#39avoiding scrutiny\u0026#39 by giving MPs a month’s more holidayThe last week that led Harry and Meghan to press the nuclear button and defy the QueenSNP\u0026#39s flagship broadband pledge running at least two years late, minister admitsComment: Harry and Meghan picked the worst week of the year to hand in their notice We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/09/TELEMMGLPICT000220654976_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqy81pHNlW26k7kWS-Prb1Cgz1KUOHT8_UU1_MRn8k65Q.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"taiwans elections remind world hong kong chinese culture","story":"Taiwan is an Asian democracy of strategic interest to the US and ChinaWhen the islanders on the windswept Taiwanese archipelago of Matsu go to the polls this Saturday, Lii Wen, the enthusiastic young candidate for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, knows he has little chance of winning a seat. But he still considers his electoral race a victory. Matsu’s 13,000-strong population will make their free choice between the DPP and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) parliamentary and presidential candidates within sight of China, where many have extended family in Fujian province, a few short miles away, who are not afforded the same rights. “Merely by holding elections in Matsu, it’s a testimony to how Chinese culture and democracy are not incompatible and it’s not what some in the Chinese Communist Party would want people to think,” said Mr Lii. Elections in Taiwan, an East Asian democracy of 23 million, are a joyful affair. After Chiang Kai-shek, the Chinese Nationalist leader, fled the Communists and retreated to the island with his Kuomintang forces in 1949, he ruled mercilessly, pursuing critics and imposing martial law that was only lifted in 1987. Elections in Taiwan are colourful eventsFive election cycles since the first direct presidential poll in 1996, Taiwan now presents a dynamic, democratic alternative to China’s authoritarian police state, boasting one of the most free societies in Asia.In contrast to its overbearing neighbour, which views Taiwan as its own territory to annex – by force if necessary – it enjoys a vibrant press and uncensored internet, has strong ties with the United States, and champions liberal values and human rights, moving recently to legalise same-sex marriage. “That tells us that this part of the world can look very different for a lot of folks, not to mention our friends in Hong Kong. If we can imagine a democratic China, that would make life easier for a lot of people.” Enoch Wu is one of the DPP\u0026#39s most prolific candidatesTaiwan’s contested status and strategic importance as a close US ally in the Asia-Pacific region mean that its election will be closely, and nervously, observed from Beijing and Washington, as well as in other regional capitals. It exists in limbo, formally recognised by only 15 diplomatic allies but operating like any other nation and maintaining de facto independence, in part thanks to political support and weapons sales from the US. In broad terms, voters are being asked to choose between a closer relationship with the US or China. Tsai Ing-wen, the incumbent president seeking a second term, is regarded by the White House as a steady hand who will back US interests in a volatile region, but she is mistrusted and frozen out by Beijing who suspect her DPP will pursue a path towards full independence. Her KMT opponent, populist Han Kuo-yu, is an unknown factor on the global stage and his views on US and China relations have been inarticulate. He advocates for closer trade ties with China without conceding political ground, but his critics claim he cannot be trusted not to sell out Taiwanese interests. Supporters of opposition candidate Han Kuo-yu at an election rallyChina’s increasing military, diplomatic and economic pressure on the island put Taiwan in a unique position to offer insights on how to deal with Chinese expansion, argued Enoch Wu. “Taiwan has been on the frontline against Chinese aggression, influence, infiltration over the past few decades. This is something a lot of the rest of the world and our regional friends now experiencing firsthand,” he said. “We have a lot of knowledge to share. Everything from the way the Chinese government wields its economic influence to achieve political ends, intelligence operations, military operations around the region.”But the outcome of this weekend’s election and its implications for Taiwan’s future direction could also have global repercussions from an economic and security point of view. Taiwan was a major exporter and trading partner with the US, as well as a vital tech hub and one of the world’s most significant semiconductor producers, pointed out Kharis Templeman, a political scientist and Taiwan expert at Stanford university. President Tsai Ing-wen is currently leading the polls“They are an important link in production chains that criss-cross the entire Pacific and if Taiwan were to be further enveloped in an exclusive PRC-led economic sphere in the region that would have a significant negative impact on US interests,” he said, referring to the People’s Republic of China. He added: “Given the rising concerns about high technology imported from China and the possible security implications of that, Taiwan is a much preferable supplier as long as it remains a free, open, democratic ruled-by-law society. Meanwhile, from a hard, strategic point of view, Taiwan is at a critical midpoint of the so-called “first island chain,” a thread of major archipelagos off the East Asian continental mainland coast that runs from Russia’s Kuril Islands to the Malay Peninsula. Han Kuo-yu, a populist mayor, is the opposition KMT candidateThe first island chain is integral to both Chinese and US military doctrine.Annexing Taiwan would grant China much desired open access to the Pacific coastline, presenting an additional challenge to Washington’s free and open Indo-Pacific strategy. Police call for curbs on anonymous pay-as-you-go phones to combat county lines gangs\u0026#39 drug dealingQueen calls Royal family crisis meeting as Harry and Meghan face backlash over breakaway planNorthern Ireland on brink of new deal to restore governmentIran plane crash: Ticket error spared man - but his wife boarded fatal flight from TehranBoris Johnson says Iran shot down Ukrainian plane, possibly by accidentComment: There\u0026#39s a logic to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s choice – but you can\u0026#39t be half royalMark Pougatch dropped from BBC Radio 5 Live: \u0026#39This was not my decision but on we go\u0026#39Comment: If Scottish Labour support calls for indyref2, it will ignite a furious battle in the party\u0026#39s ranksI said to Meghan: \u0026#39Why don\u0026#39t you just jack it all in?\u0026#39 I didn\u0026#39t expect an answer\u0026#39Relaxed Duchess signals how modern monarchy is safe in Cambridges\u0026#39 handsHelen McCourt\u0026#39s family seek urgent judicial review to prevent release of killer who never revealed location of her bodyHow the royals gave Harry and Meghan everything they wanted - but they still wanted moreAI technology to catch paedophiles grooming children by their use of language launched by GovernmentBoris Johnson\u0026#39s Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes final stage in Commons Harry and Meghan quit the Firm: The US money makers set to keep funds flowingScottish Labour to make spring decision on backing second independence referendumGovernment accused of \u0026#39avoiding scrutiny\u0026#39 by giving MPs a month’s more holidayThe last week that led Harry and Meghan to press the nuclear button and defy the QueenSNP\u0026#39s flagship broadband pledge running at least two years late, minister admitsComment: Harry and Meghan picked the worst week of the year to hand in their notice We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/07/11/istock-187287146.jpg","title":"cycle to work bike cycling london 2020 environment","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How did things get so bad in my kitchen?’ asks food writer Julia Platt LeonardI avoid cleaning my refrigerator like other people put off doing their taxes. I wait until it’s a sea of plastic containers, cling-film-wrapped onion halves, teetering jars – until I can’t find the mayonnaise or remember where the parmesan cheese is. Only then, when I can’t fit another thing inside, do I take it all out.\u0026nbspI throw out the piece of salmon skin I was going to give to the dogs. I toss out something spore-covered (carrots? meatballs?) and another item I think used to be a solid but is now liquid. Judging by the amount of mould, you’d think I was starting up a penicillin laboratory.And each time I chuck out an uneaten leftover or a floppy cucumber I feel ashamed – ashamed at the waste. As a food writer, I know better.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, about one third of the food produced in the world – a whopping 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost. In richer countries we waste as much food as sub-Saharan Africa produces. I’ve interviewed farmers, written about food policy and yet I’m part of the problem.I see myself standing before a food waste deity (picture Greta Thunberg with a white beard) and am forced to look at the piles of food I’ve wasted. It’s not a pretty picture. How did things get so bad in my kitchen?Why I’ve decided to start cycling to workI went to cooking school and worked in professional kitchens so FIFO – “first-in, first-out” – was my mantra. Food came in and we prepared and served it to ensure that waste was kept to a minimum. We labelled containers and made prep lists so nothing was missed. The walk-in fridge was kept clean, for hygiene reasons of course, but also so we knew what we had and ordered accordingly. My fridge? A disaster zone.I wasn’t raised to waste. My maternal grandparents came from western Kentucky, got married during the depression, and would no sooner have wasted a morsel of food than they would have walked down the street naked. When things were really tight, my grandmother reused coffee grounds and gave cucina povera a decidedly southern twist. My mother was the same, serving a meal one night, leftovers the next, and if necessary ‘must-go’ servings on the third.Food that’s not eaten either goes down the drain, is incinerated or ends up on a landfill where greenhouse gases are generated. That’s waste. But it’s also a waste because land, water, labour and energy were spent to create the food I binned. It’s also food that could have fed other people.My food waste, whether it’s the mystery container wedged in the back of the fridge or the past-sell-by date beans on my cupboard shelves, must stop. That’s why I’ve committed to reducing my food waste in 2020.Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThat means getting a handle on what comes in my kitchen and what goes back out. It also means taking a critical look at the food choices I’m making. If I want my kitchen to be more sustainable then it’s time to ask some tough questions. Where do the foods I eat come from? What impact do they make on the earth? Can I justify eating avocados or pouring almond milk on my cereal? And the elephant – scratch that, cow – in the room, can I be an ethical omnivore?I’m going to learn more about food labelling to find out what it tells us, and what it doesn’t. I’ll figure out how to cut down on plastic in my kitchen and waste in my cooking. I’ll embrace my leftovers and think before I buy.I’ll make my kitchen and my cooking more sustainable in 2020, one meal at a time.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He warned that many assets were at risk of being rendered “worthless” by the climate crisis.Under Mr Carney’s leadership, the Bank recently announced plans to conduct “stress tests” designed to forecast how well financial firms would cope with various future climate change scenarios. Those that fail to pass the tests could be required to hold more capital or get rid of assets.Barclays has made itself a climate pariah. Time for a boycottJeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, which organised the shareholder resolution, said: “The message is clear. Piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it.\u0026nbsp“For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing.\u0026nbsp“We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science. If Barclays supports the Paris Agreement, it will support this resolution.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response.

She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie.

Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3040 11.

But it’s also the story of Mexico’s history, as seen through the perspective of those who have, for so long, been left voiceless. This is Cuarón’s masterpiece. CL2340 18. The Act of KillingIt feels remarkable, given how easy it is to turn away from evil,CLPark Chan-Wook’s twisted homage to Hitchcock’s Shadow of a DoubtCLLike Ken Loach’s Kes, Clio Barnard’s Bradford-set tale, very loosely inspired by the Oscar Wilde story, combines lyricism with polemic. It captures brilliantly the mischief and resourcefulness of its two young protagonists (teenage kids excluded from school) while laying bare the brutality of the society in which they and their families are cast adrift.

Son of SaulIn \u0027Son of Saul\u0027 Geza Rohrig plays a Hungarian-Jewish prisoner tasked with the extermination of his fellow JewsLady Bird – and its story of a frustrated teen (Saoirse Ronan)Wes Anderson’s kitsch yarn, largely set in a luxurious spa hotel just before the Second World War, is an elegy for a lost world. Whether it’s Alexandre Desplat’s music, the eye-popping colours or the mannered but brilliant performances, all the elements here are perfectly judged. A film that could easily have seemed flimsy and conceited is instead utterly enrapturing. GMSteve McQueen’s harrowing period drama confronts audiences with the reality of slavery. Racist white owners treat their slaves as if they’re livestock, not human beings. Chiwetel Ejiofor excels as Solomon Northup, the free man sold into slavery. The film has a furious polemical charge but also works as a terrifying Kafkaesque drama about a man who falls off the face of the world. GM3040 11.

Jordan Peele’s horror satire is a polished, spooky and supremely well-executed chiller, but works even better as a deconstruction of race.

He warned that many assets were at risk of being rendered “worthless” by the climate crisis.Under Mr Carney’s leadership, the Bank recently announced plans to conduct “stress tests” designed to forecast how well financial firms would cope with various future climate change scenarios. Those that fail to pass the tests could be required to hold more capital or get rid of assets.Barclays has made itself a climate pariah. Time for a boycottJeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction, which organised the shareholder resolution, said: “The message is clear. Piecemeal changes in energy policy will no longer cut it.\u0026nbsp“For too long, minor policy improvements have provided cover for the banking sector, while failing to halt fossil fuel financing.\u0026nbsp“We know what needs to happen. Banks must align their lending with the science.

As such, we welcome ShareAction’s call to the world’s largest banks to integrate climate change risk assessment and to set and disclose adequate phase-out targets in response. We hope the Barclays Board formally supports this resolution.”A spokesperson for Barclays said: “We are working to help tackle climate change, and we meet with Share Action and other shareholders regularly to update them on our progress.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker.

This was the largest increase since February 2018, and up from 2.1 per cent in November.”Mr Archer added: “It is possible that house prices got a boost in November and December from some buyers keen to get their move done before the general election to avoid any shocks or uncertainties that could arise.”However, he warned: “It should also be borne in mind that the Halifax measure tends to give higher house price readings than other measures.”House prices slump to seven-year low“Looking ahead, we expect uncertainty in the economy to ease somewhat in 2020, which should see transaction volumes increase and further price growth made possible by an improvement in households\u0027 real incomes.“Longer-term issues, such as the shortage of homes for sale and low levels of house-building, will continue to limit supply, while the ongoing challenges faced by prospective buyers in raising deposits will serve to constrain demand.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Maybe private school children can cope with the world of unsupervised access to the internet. If they come home and their parents are with them, sat around the dinner table, talking about the politics of the day and they monitor their screen usage, then fine.\u0026nbsp“But that isn’t what happens in reality for kids in the inner city. Their lives are at risk and I don’t understand why anybody would want to encourage children to use smartphones.”The argument follows the decision by\u0026nbspSt Peter’s CE Primary School in Leigh, near Wigan, to make\u0026nbspthe playground a mobile-free zone to encourage parents to listen to their children at the end of the day.Additional reporting by Press Association\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A lively debate on social media, which included Piers Morgan labelling the bakery chain “PC-ravaged clowns”, ensured the new product was a hit.\u0026nbspGreggs\u0026nbspwill no doubt be hoping that the new meat-free steak bake, launched last week, also becomes a customer favourite.While\u0026nbspthe vegan launches have generated huge interest from consumers, Greggs’\u0026nbspfortunes have been buoyed by a broader strategy of transforming itself from a traditional bakery into a more modern food-to-go chain, offering a range of products including salads and coffee.Like-for-like sales jumped 9.2 per cent in 2019, Greggs revealed\u0026nbspas it upgraded its profit guidance for the third time in two months. The announcement comes after shareholders banked a £35m special idend in October thanks to the company’s better-than-expected performance.We tested Gregg’s new vegan steak bake and this is what it’s likeUnderlying pre-tax profit for the year will still be ahead of expectations\u0026nbspeven after the £7m staff bonus, Greggs said.“I am delighted to announce that we will also be making a special additional payment to all of our colleagues across the business who have worked so hard to deliver this success in what has been a phenomenal year,” chief executive Roger Whiteside said on Wednesday.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like-for-like sales, which strip\u0026nbspout the effect of shop openings and closures, were up 9.2 per cent.“Looking to the year ahead, we face strong sales comparatives and cost inflation headwinds present a challenge,” Mr Whiteside said.Created with Sketch.

Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete. Believing a natural diet is key, Matt’s second cookbook is brimming with recipes full of veggies and largely focuses on un-processed ingredients (keeping the vegan cheese or meat-substitutes to a minimum). Some of Pritchard’s favourites include roasting tin laksa, sticky tofu bao buns and rhubarb and custard doughnuts. If you’re yet to convince your pal\u0027s that veganism is the way forward, we reckon the Dinner with Mates chapter will convert a few of them, with all the recipes you need to create a Mexican feast, a perfect picnic, a banging BBQ or a cracking Christmas spread. All in all we found recipes really varied, with us ear-marking nearly all of them to try at once.813 ‘5 Ingredient Vegan’ by Katy Beskow. Published by Quadrille: £12.08, AmazonLet’s face it, at the end of a long day the last thing any of us want to be doing – whether we’re following a plant-based diet or not – is trying to track down long lists of hard to find ingredients. This is the fourth book from the award-winning cook, writer and cookery tutor Katy Beskow and follows a similar simplified format, with each recipe requiring just five ingredients. Chapters include soups, lunches suppers, sweets and basics, with recipes beautifully laid out and gorgeous photography accompanying each one. Far from being basic, we were amazed to see we could create a beautiful Mediterranean briam (a layered courgette, potato and red onion bake from Greece) which was as delicious hot with crusty bread as it was cold for lunch the next day.913 ‘Zaika: Vegan recipes from India’ by Romy Gill. Published by Seven Dials : £10, AmazonGrowing up in a small town in West Bengal, India, very few people, including Romy Gill’s own family, ate meat regularly. It’s this home-cooked vegan food of her childhood that the chef and food writer wanted to share with us through her debut cookbook Zaika – meaning taste, or flavour. There’s an entire section dedicated to bread, including gram flour turmeric pancakes which are perfect with chutneys, a variety of rotis and parathas and light naan bread with nigella seeds. The Light \u0026amp Breezy chapter is all about showcasing the freshest ingredients – think watermelon and mint salad while the Warming the Heart chapter is where you’ll find hearty comfort food such as spicy red lentil dahl. The section we most fell for though was Labours of Love for when you’ve got time to really get lost in the kitchen – rich, creamy and so warming, we recommend the Baingan masala with baby aubergines, dill and coconut.1013 ‘Rebel Recipes: Maximum flavour, minimum fuss: the ultimate in vegan food’ by Niki Webster. Published by Bloomsbury: £18, AmazonThe debut book from award-winning blogger and food consultant Nikki Webster shares the same ethos as her blog Rebel Recipes – that healthy food needn’t be boring or lacking in flavour. Taking inspiration from around the globe, you could never accuse these recipes of being dull. If only we could start every day with creamy spiced coconut porridge and sticky sesame banana! Instead of relying on stale vegan ingredients and recipes – this is new-school vegan cuisine for those seeking full flavours. Although despite this, recipes were easy to follow and largely uncomplicated – with lots of spicy curries, pulses, flatbreads, salads, dips and pickles making an appearance. With mouth-watering photography throughout, the Can’t Believe It’s Vegan Desserts chapter is a particular highlight, with the likes of chocolate ganache tart, easy espresso martini pots and lemon curd and thyme tart. 1113 ‘Green: Veggie and vegan meals for no-fuss weeks and relaxed weekends’ by Elly Pear (Curshen). Published by Ebury Press: £14.99, AmazonWhile this title isn’t 100 per cent vegan, half of the book is made up of plant-based recipes so we felt it was still well worth including. Acknowledging that most of us have more time to experiment in the kitchen at the weekend yet need dinner on the table pronto mid-week, Elly Pear’s book separates dishes accordingly. We’re very keen to incorporate more Sunday night batch-cooking into our weekly routine, in order to eat better later in the week and with tray bakes, one-pot wonders and freeze-able options, this will keep us suitably inspired.1213 ‘Vegan (ish): 100 simple, budget recipes that don\u0027t cost the earth’ by Jack Monroe. Published by Bluebird: £10.66, AmazonDon’t be fooled by the title, every one of the 100 recipes within this book is completely vegan. The “ish” comes from Jack Monroe’s belief that if we were all to incorporate a few more plant-based meals into our diet each week, we’d be better off both environmentally and financially. So you needn’t be a full-time vegan to appreciate the practical, inexpensive solutions within this book. Although perhaps not the sexiest food chapter to ever be written – the whole section on sandwiches was inherently helpful for midweek meal inspiration (especially when you consider the “standard” fillings of cheese, ham, tuna, etc obviously aren’t vegan). In true Jack Monroe style, we loved the no-nonsense, easy to follow recipes and believe we’ll turn to this cookbook on a regular basis. 1313 ‘7 Day Vegan Challenge’ by Bettina Campolucci-Bordi. Published by Hardie Grant: £9.72, WorderyIf you’re tempted to give this vegan thing a whirl but you really don’t know where to start, the 7 Day Vegan Challenge is here to help. There are three menu plans to choose from complete with shopping lists: The Easy Peasy Way (quick meals for those that don’t mind repeating some dishes), For the Planners (which requires a Sunday night batch-cooking session) and Fast \u0026amp Fresh (quick and simple recipes). So a typical weekday might look like, banoffee oats for breakfast, a convincing vegan take on the classic BLT sandwich for lunch and creamy satay noodles with salt and pepper fried tofu for tea.Veganuary becomes bigger every year, but it needn\u0027t be just for Janaury as these cookbooks make it easy and accessible. Words by Stacey Smith213 ‘Rachel Ama’s Vegan Eats: Tasty plant-based recipes for every day’ by Rachel Ama. Published by Ebury Press: £12.87, AmazonSince launching her vegan YouTube channel in 2017, Rachel has gained a heap of hungry followers who lap up her simple, delicious recipes (and the dance moves that go along with them). Dishes are often one-pot, can be prepped ahead, and most include a song recommendation so you can dance along as you cook. Within these pages, you’ll find plenty of meals inspired by Ama’s Caribbean and West African roots – from crispy jerk barbecue tacos or ackee “saltfish” with dumplings to peanut stew. Although this is really a celebration of all cultures – and with vegan takes on everything from Thai green curry to creamy cashew and vegetable no-pasta lasagne, we’re pretty confident you’ll find your favourite comfort dish has been given a plant-based makeover. With most ingredients easy to obtain and meals quick to put together, this is modern cooking, for the meat-shunning millennial. 313 ‘BOSH! Healthy Vegan’ by Henry Firth \u0026amp Ian Theasby. Published by HQ: £10.87, AmazonWorking with a registered dietician to ensure recipes follow trusted NHS guidelines, the BOSH! boys (aka, Henry and Ian) have bought us their healthiest cookbook to date. Recognising that just because a plate of food is vegan, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s healthy (vegan junk food certainly exists!), this is a collection of 80 new recipes showcasing their flavoursome vegan food with a healthier focus. Along with advice on sleep, movement and relaxing, there’s guidance on ensuring you get all the nutrients you need. And although the boys insist this isn’t a diet book, you’ll find recipes to help you reduce fat, build muscle and generally be a bit healthier. So whether you’re looking to up your protein intake (try the ultimate veg tacos), reduce your sugar intake with a summer-berry granola bowl or keep your calorie intake to under 500 per portion with puttanesca potato stew, you should be left feeling suitably inspired to kick start the new year.413 ‘Happy Vegan: Easy plant-based recipes to make the whole family happy’ by Fearne Cotton. Published by Seven Dials: £13.46, AmazonDespite Fearne Cotton not being a fully-fledged vegan herself (or perhaps because), this book got rave reviews from our panel, with both flexitarians, meat-eaters and vegans alike. Recipes are approachable, inexpensive and perfect for the whole family, so we can see ourselves working through them all in time. The broccoli katsu curry was a particular favourite and surprisingly easy to make and for tea time we’ll be trying our hand at her date and almond cake with caramel sauce which uses white miso paste and coconut cream to great effect.513 ‘Vegan One Pound Meals: Delicious budget-friendly plant-based recipes all for £1 per person’ by Miguel Barclay. Published by Headline Home: £10.75, AmazonIf ever there’s a time we feel the pinch, it’s January, with the festivities of Christmas long behind us but the credit card still to pay. Thankfully eating a plant-based diet could be the answer and in this book, you’ll find over 85 recipes all coming in at a frankly unbelievable £1 a portion. Our concerns that we’d be living off of beans on toast were quickly alleviated as we tucked into black bean meatballs and sticky aubergine bao. Full-flavoured, quick and easy, we couldn’t really ask for more.613 ‘Incredible Plant-Based Desserts: Colorful Vegan Cakes, Cookies, Tarts, and other Epic Delights’ by Anthea Cheng. Published by Quarry Books: £11.89, AmazonCalling all sweet-tooths! This collection of recipes from Australian blogger Anthea Cheng is celebratory food for the keen baker. You certainly couldn’t call dried rainbow pear slices convenient, quick or easy to make, however the impact they have when used to decorate her chai cake is truly show-stopping. If that all sounds a little intimidating, we found the Snack Time chapter much more manageable, with the likes of bliss balls, chocolate cups and cookies vying for attention, as well as Instagrammable breakfast bowls, beautifully presented with nut butters, granola and oats.713 ‘Dirty Vegan Another Bite’ by Matt Pritchard, published by Octopus Books: £20, Octopus BooksAfter 10 years of hard partying finally caught up with him, Matt decided to switch from the crazy pranks of MTV’s Dirty Sanchez to fitness – and is now a completely vegan endurance athlete.

It is so faint that it is hard to find even with a telescope.But some time around 2083, it will explode and shine with the intensity of\u0026nbspSirius, the brightest star we can see in the night sky. At that point, it will become the most luminous star in our Milky Way galaxy.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen that happens, the star will become involved in a dramatic, violent death-spiral that will send out light that will be bright and visible from Earth, astronomers have said.“We now have a strong prediction for the future of V Sge,” said Bradley E.

Those CVs\u0026nbspconsist of normal star that it is in orbit around a white dwarf, and sees the ordinary star\u0027s mass gradually dropping onto the white dwarf, and they can often exhibit dramatic, spectacular behaviour as they do.Star is acting strangely and may be about to explode, astronomers sayEven among CVs, V Sge\u0026nbspis intense: it is the most extreme of any known, and is 100 times more luminous than all other known examples. It is churning a huge stellar wind that is similar to the one thrown out by the most massive stars as they die.It has already been getting brighter, and until the last decade it had been getting 10 times as luminous. Scientists were able to confirm that using historical data that showed it had got much more luminous between 1907 and recent years.That will continue as more of the mass falls away, resulting in a dramatic climax that will see most of the gas fall from the big star into the white dwarf in its last weeks and days.This falling mass will release a tremendous amount of gravitational potential energy, driving a stellar wind as never before seen, and raise the system luminosity to just short of that of supernovae at peak, said Professor Schaefer in a statement.Eventually they will merge into one star, hitting their peak brightness. It will leave behind one single star that has a white dwarf core.Astronomers were able to use their historical understanding of the strange behaviour of V Sge\u0026nbspto predict its future. They say the final merging will happen around 2083, though it could be around 16 years either way.“Thus, V\u0026nbspSge\u0026nbspwill appear startlingly bright in the night sky, said Schaefer. “This is substantially brighter than the all-time brightest known nova (at -0.5) just over a century ago, and the last time any \u0027guest star\u0027 appeared brighter was Kepler\u0027s Supernova in the year 1604.“Now people the world over can know that they will see a wondrous guest star shining as the brightest in the sky for a month or so, being pointed at by the Arrow just below Cygnus, the Swan,” said Schaefer.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Once an undocumented child turns 18, they face the threat of deportation to a country they may never have visited.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt estimates that\u0026nbspoverall, 674,000 undocumented adults and children – which\u0026nbspcan include those who were born in the UK or have spent the majority of their life in the country, as well as those who are eligible for citizenship but cannot afford to apply for it – are living in the capital.Mr Khan said the fact so many young people had no formal status was a “national disgrace”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspand called on the government to take urgent action by ministers to provide financial support to advice services, cut extortionate immigration and citizenship fees and reinstate legal aid for children’s immigration cases.£1,012 charge to register children as British citizens ruled unlawfulFrom Windrush to the NHS: The evolution of the ‘hostile environment’Thousands of EU children at risk due to ‘woefully inadequate’ supportHe also warned of the potential for a further crisis with Brexit, if the 260,000 European-national children and 96,000 European-national young people living in the capital are not supported in applying to the EU Settlement Scheme, or for citizenship.“The application process for the EU Settlement Scheme is unnecessarily complex and, with many vulnerable people struggling to secure their rights, the government risks abandoning whole generations to an uncertain future,” the mayor said.“The Windrush scandal proved that the government’s hostile immigration policies were not fit for purpose and swift action must be taken now to support our young people and prevent another crisis taking place.”Kamena Dorling, Coram Children’s Legal Centre’s group head of policy and public affairs, said UK citizenship and immigration policy was failing a significant number of children who have grown up in the UK.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But rather than voting for our amendment, Conservative MPs are willing to let ministers negotiate away our membership of Erasmus if they think they could do a better job.“It is time the Tories wake up and smell the coffee – are they in favour of staying in Erasmus or not?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMr Skidmore dismissed Wednesday’s\u0026nbspamendment as “game-playing by opposition parties”, insisting that the UK remains “open” to continued participation in the scheme, subject to negotiations with the remaining EU states.And the Department for Education said that the government was “committed to continuing the academic relationship between the UK and the EU, including through the next Erasmus+ programme if it is in our interests to do so”.\u0026nbspBut the international director of the Association of Colleges, Emma Meredith, said: “Erasmus+ is a brilliant programme for opening up the world for young people and helping show people from across Europe that the UK is open to them.“UK colleges will still be able to apply for Erasmus+ funding in 2020 during the ‘transition period’. There is a definite risk that UK participation could stop in 2021, or that Erasmus+ could be replaced by another mobility programme.”Ms Meredith said the AoC remained “optimistic” that securing continued access to Erasmus+ would be high on the UK’s priority list for negotiations on the future partnership with the EU, which will begin after the official date of Brexit on 31 January and are due to conclude at the end of this year.Jo Grady,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the University and College Union, said: “Wilfully abandoning Erasmus+ would be a worryingly closed-minded move. The many benefits from having the opportunity to study abroad –\u0026nbspfrom boosting employment prospects, to learning other languages and from other cultures –\u0026nbspare well documented.”And the director of the Erasmus+ programme in the UK, Jane Racz, said: “The Erasmus+ programme has delivered and continues to deliver significant benefits to the UK and we need to ensure the positives of the programme are not lost as we move into the next stage”.Supporters of Erasmus+ expressed their anger on Twitter, where former student Josh Aarons said: “As someone from a working class background who studied and worked in Germany and Spain as part of my degree placement, who greatly benefited both educationally and culturally from Erasmus+, it is a crying shame that we cut off from a mutually beneficial exchange.”Sheffield Hallam University lecturer Steph Hannam-Swain said: “This is such a loss! We have some amazing Erasmus+ students each year who bring richness to our classes.”And charity worker Ashley Thompson said: “This is awful. These students have an amazing impact on our organisation and have so much to offer. Failing to continue with Erasmus+ programme will hurt British business now. It denies future generations an amazing opportunity.”Association of Colleges\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspUniversity and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Which will it be  The acidic lime-barrel, the chewy coconut caramel or the tooth-shattering walnut swirl Labour Party members face that sort of dilemma this week.The contest to be their next leader will begin properly today when MPsto Westminster. Defeat in last month’s ­General Election has left the party’s ranks depleted.The choice of candidates is hardly appetising.If you were talking about Quality Street, you’d say they’re all a bit nutty.Will it be wonkish Sir Keir Starmer, a legal oddball who never blinks, or will it be ­prolier-than-thou Jess Phillips, veering all over the political piste like Austrian ski legend Franz Klammer after lunch Could it be Lady Wobbles  I talk, naturally, of Emily Thornberry, who may or may not be the lovechild of Hattie Jacques and Boris Yeltsin.Her snobbery about White Van Man will probably knock la-di-dah Emily out of the running, although she is probably the one the Tories fear most.What about tough guy Clive Lewis, an unknown fashion dude from East Anglia whose only criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is that he wasn’t really left-wing enough Wigan lass Lisa Nandy — so earnest she looks asshe could burst into tears at any moment — is also in the contest. Then there is Rebecca Long-Bailey, she of the Mrs Merton spectacles, fanciedby Corbyn’s old Marxist sidekick John McDonnell.Long-Bailey is untested. But so are the others. I was going to shock you by noting that Thornberry, having once been a ministerial aide, is the only candidate to have had a snf of Whitehall experience.Then I realised that she is the only one of them to have actually sat on the governing side in the House of Commons.Nandy became an MP in , when Labour left office.The rest entered the Commons only in .OK, let’s look on the bright side. They should all have a certain novelty value.So how come they feel so unexciting  It’s because they represent old ideas.Tony Blair is nowadays a discredited figure but when he was leader of the Opposition in the s, he did something shrewd.He wrenched his party into the modern era by producing a pledge card with five basic promises. They helped him win a landslide in the  General Election.Blair’s five pledges reflected the electorate’s priorities: Smaller class sizes for primary schools, quicker punishment of young offenders, shorter NHS waiting times, getting younger people off benefits by using a windfall tax on privatised utilities, and a promise not to raise income tax.Blair grasped how Labour was seen by the voters. His pledge card helped address those worries. The policies themselves were only part of the trick. Equally important was the idea that Blair’s Labour was prepared to listen.A quarter of a century on, the next Labour leader should repeat Blair’s trick and be honest about how the party is seen.Here are five basic philosophical pledges that might help to address the problem.PLEDGE : Saving is a virtue. One reason Jeremy Corbyn bombed in last month’s election was that his spending plans were seen as madly extravagant. Voters may not like government “austerity” but they aren’t mugs. They know state spending has to be paid for.If you are a government or an inidual, you can’t live for ever on the never-never.It’s time Labour reacquainted itself with prudence.PLEDGE : Patriotism is honourable. Wouldn’t it be amazing to hear a Labour leader say this Yet since the decline of the British Empire, the Left has regarded patriotism as a dirty word. This is electorally crazy.Patriotism is merely an expression of civic pride, of communal values channelled into the identity of the democratic nation state and its Queen.Working-class former Labour voters love American patriotism .They applaud the Aussies and South Africans when they wave their flags.What is so wrong with being proud of Britain PLEDGE : Stable families strengthen us all.I’m not making a point about marital infidelities — MPs are the last people who should preach about sex! — but Labour’s promotion of metropolitan lestyles has created an idea it disapproves of “normal” family set-ups.Add to that its reluctance to give families tax breaks and its strange cultural suspicion of adoption. Former Labour seats are often areas with the strongest notion of traditional family solidarity.A wise leadership candidate would acknowledge that.PLEDGE : Brexit is irreversible. Please. This matter has been settled.And yet that fool Jess Phillips is hinting that she wants us to rejoin the EU. Electoral suicide.PLEDGE : No more jobsworths. Bigger than everything  is the suspicion that officialdom is an ass.The British people are wonderfully tolerant but they are driven mad by petty regulation — particularly when it comes to minority grievances.“Jobsworths” who say that ignoring daft political-correctness is “more than my job’s worth” are the bane of Britain.Who is more intolerant: A provincial baker who hesitates to ice a wedding cake for a gay couple, or the gay couple who take that baker to the High Court to prove a point We all know whose side Labour politicians would have been on.A would-be Labour leader who cheerfully made these pledges would be a Labour leader who could connect with the electoral mainstream.But will any of them do so  Don’t hold your breath.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s been rude to the world’s biggest stars before. Never has he hit the nail on the head like that or with such venom.For too long, politically correct movie actors and musicians have lectured the little people on how to live better lives, lives more like theirs. They tell us to cut back — as they fly around the globe in private jets and live in multiple mansions with monstrous carbon footprints.They leap aboard every soul-sappingly tedious and vacuously “woke” bandwagon and instruct us to do the same.They tell us how to vote — always noisily and cluelessly backing the left, safe in the knowledge no forced redistribution could ever really dent their vast wealth.At last a fellow multi-millionaire actor and comic has told them to shut up. That they’re “in no position to lecture the public about anything”. That they “know nothing about the real world”.Ordinary people ARE sick of these ill-informed egomaniacs. That’s why celebrity endorsements never help Labour here — or the Democrats in the US.We doubt that any of these Golden Globetrotters will have the self-awareness or humility to wind their necks in.But we’re proud that as millions watched, cheering, a plain-talking Brit burst the celebs’ bubble.Every word was bang on their money.WE have our fingers crossed for the Cyprus gang-rape teenager as she learns her fate today.She may yet be freed with a presidential pardon. If not, the already grave doubts about the country’s justice ­system will deepen.And our Foreign Secretary will have every justication in warning Brits about the safety of its resorts like Ayia Napa.It is increasingly obvious this young woman was shamefully treated, by the men involved, by police and by the judge.President Nicos Anastasiades must end this madness.BREXITERS have won another battle: The Government will launch parallel trade talks with the US and EU next month. Excellent.It’s not just that a little competition should generate some urgency in both. Especially Brussels, whose new Irish trade chief Phil Hogan still foolishly seems to believe — against all the ­evidence — that there is mileage in sneering at ­Britain, Brexit and Boris.It’s also that, when it comes to America, we must strike while the iron is hot.We are top of Donald Trump’s list for a deal. And he likes Boris. But Trump may not win a second term and his replacement could be less keen.Britain cannot afford to delay.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just because you ignore it, it doesn’t mean it no longer exists.Now research shows that going for regular runs could add years to your le.Running reverses the effects of ageing on your blood vessels, and even after a few goes runners have lower blood pressure than when they started.I’m about to run my first marathon at the ripe old age of , having built up the habit from a standing start.Here are some other good things running does:Weight will drop off you — I’m three stone lighter after taking it up two years ago. Your sleep cycle improves. Weirdly, you will have more energy. Your mental health will be better. It will spur you on to be healthy in other aspects of le.I get it, though. It’s easy to look at the swathe of runners and balk. Not a single thing about it looks fun.While some jammy gits manage to glide around the streets looking effortless, most of us look sweaty, out of breath and in deep, deep discomfort. Because we are.Most runners hate doing the actual running. Occasionally, on a nice balmy evening, you might forget you are five miles from home and the only way to get there is to keep running. But more often than not, you’re willing it to be over.No, most runners don’t run for the joyful act of running — we run for the sublime, borderline orgasmic feeling of having run.I sobered up more than two years ago, which would never have been a success had I not taken up running.I was a fastidious non-runner. I’d tried it, it was boring and it really, really hurt. But as those with addictive personalities know only too well, you have to swap drink with something. After Robbie Williams gave up cocaine he ensured Colombia still earned a few quid by necking up to  espressos a day.Like all men staring middle age in the face, I’d ignored any form of cardio exercise and instead spent a decade seeking the cliched T-shirt look.Abs that could give you a paper cut, biceps like grapefruits and whole hams for shoulders.All that cardio looked too much like hard work. And besides, you didn’t see Brad Pitt legging it round the park in Fight Club, did you Well as it turns out, the abs didn’t materialise and I just ended up feeling miserable. So when sobriety kicked in and I had a lot more time on my hands, I decided to see what running was about.My first go was an absolute tragedy and I am grateful no one witnessed me running a mere  yards before tripping over my dog. It was awful. I was wheezing and clutching my spare tyre, but I had broken the seal.Five minutes later I felt great. The dopamine and endorphins kicked in and I could have taken on the world, although my hamstrings said otherwise.Those  yards became  the next day and so on until I hit my first milestone — one whole kilometre. I was now officially hooked.Within two months I had completed my first Parkrun. Anyone who feels self-conscious about running should join their local Parkrun, as the sense of community and inclusion is fantastic.I’d shed a stone and felt utterly incredible — and I didn’t stop there. I now run more than  miles every week and in April I will take on my first London Marathon. I’m excited but also utterly terried.If you’re a non-runner, the thought of running is daunting.But trust me, aside from giving up smoking, it will be the most rewarding thing you’ll do for your body and mind. As well as the physical benefits it really, really sorts your head out.No social media, no people chasing work — it’s just you and your thoughts. I’ve had some of my best ideas and made some le-changing decisions running along the side of the Basingstoke canal.Just try it for a week. It’s completely free, unless you’re like me and treat it as an excuse to open up a whole new world of gadgetry.You can do it anywhere at any time you feel like it. And, crucially, you will never regret going for a run, ever.Put on any old pair of trainers, stick the headphones in, listen to a podcast, pick a landmark to run to and just go for it, as slowly as you need to. If it hurts, stop running and walk, then run again for a bit — and so on.This was me two years ago — and now Mo Farah had better be looking over his shoulder in April .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Crucially, it means confronting intransigent teaching unions which are always a roadblock to progress.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson must show the same zeal as Michael Gove did in turning bad schools round.Many are in election-battleground seats, so fixing them is politically smart.More importantly, it’s vital for hundreds of thousands of kids who only get one chance at an education.

Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support.Prince Harry and Meghan are moving away from Britain as they want to create new roles for themselves within the Royal Family.Following the move, the pair will quit their positions as senior royals and instead split their time between Britain and North America - with Canada expected to be their second home.The decision comes after the couple reportedly spent a successful six-week trial period in Canada over the Christmas holidays.Friends of the couple in both the Canada and the US are supportive of their decision to spend more time across the pond.At this point in time it is unclear which Canadian city The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be moving to.However, the royal couple spent their six-week trial holiday on the west coast in Vancouver, along with Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland - so this could be a possible destination.It is likely they will still be called the Duke and Duchess of Sussex while they live abroad.As they said in their statement, they will still honour their duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth and patronages, so its assumed at the moment that they will be keeping their titles.Meghan and Harry plan to be financially independent and move away from their current senior roles in the Royal Family - but will still support the Queen.With rumours currently flying around that the family had no idea that the couple were planning on making this decision, the statement from the Palace was short.The statement read: Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work though.It has been reported that a royal aide said: People had bent over backwards for them.They were given the wedding they wanted, the house they wanted, the office they wanted, the money they wanted, the staff they wanted, the tours they wanted and had the backing of their family. What more did they want The Palace released a statement shortly after the announcement was made.It read: Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.Friends of the couple believe that it has become clear to the couple that the monarchy is moving towards a future focused on Prince Charles and Prince William.One told The Sun: “They are back to work. They have nothing to hide and have got so much good work to do.But it has been made very clear by the institution that the Sussexes are not central to the future plan.“Just look at the picture released last week of the Queen with the Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge and George.”Good Morning Britain co-presenter Piers Morgan slammed former Suits actress Meghan on Twitter for the move and even blamed her for splitting up the Royal Family.People say Im too critical of Meghan Markle - but she ditched her family, ditched her dad, ditched most of her old friends, split Harry from William and has now split him from the Royal Family.

Medics at the Royal London Hospital decided Tafida’s condition was “end of le”.In October, NHS chiefs asked the High Court to rule that Tafida’s breathing tube should be taken out and the little girl allowed to die.But a judge decided her parents should be allowed to fly her to the Italian hospital where doctors believed she was not “end of le” — but needed more time for the brain to heal itself.Sun readers backed Tafida’s parents. It was the first time a UK court has allowed a child to be taken abroad against the wishes of the NHS.And yesterday doctors at the Gaslini Institute announced the news of Tafida’s improvement after just  weeks.Dr Andrea Moscatelli revealed she was “no longer in danger”.He said fluid on Tafida’s brain had been drained and doctors carried out a tracheotomy to assist her breathing.She also underwent a procedure to help with her eating.Dr Moscatelli explained these were all procedures which would hopefully prevent any long-term complications and eventually help her tohome.He added: “She has been stabilised from the neurological point of view and as a result her breathing has improved.“The little girl is able to breathe on her own.“We have been able to continue the programme of care as agreed with the High Court in London.‘’She can now move onto the next stage of treatment, which is not so intense, with the ultimate objective being able toher home to her family.“Elements that were troubling her have now been removed.’’Dad Mohammed, , from Plaistow, East London said: “The medical staff put Tafida on a buggy which means that, at last, she can be moved outside which was always our dream for her.”Construction consultant Mohammed, who is in the UK working, watched via a video call on his phone as Tafida was moved from the intensive care department to a nearby rehab unit.There she will receive the most advanced rehabilitation techniques and hydrotherapy to get her muscles moving again.Mohammed added: “For nearly a year she has been cooped up in a room. Now she is in a buggy, we will be able to take her outdoors and stimulate her brain.”The Gaslini hospital has its own beach — so Shelina and Mohammed will be able to take their daughter down to the sea to feel the water on her toes.Tafida arrived in Genoa on October  on board a private jet chartered by the hospital.The doctors said even then they were confident she would eventually be able to go home to be looked after by her family.Mohammed said yesterday: “There is still a long way to go but now she is out of intensive care we on the right path and going in the right direction.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do I feel diminished, I wondered, very briefly Nah, I concluded, sod that. Good shot. And good riddance. I felt no more regret than when I squash a tick from my dog’s back.Soleimani was a vile man. He orchestrated terrorist attacks which caused death, misery and mayhem for millions across the Middle East and beyond.He was in Iraq planning attacks against our own forces as well as American ones. And he was doing so in the service of a country which has a pretty good claim to being the worst in the world — Iran.Hell, even North Korea can’t match Iran for its support of worldwide terrorism and the multiple murders in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Yemen.Iran is a pariah state, a thoroughly odious religious dictatorship, under which homosexuals are executed, Christians and Jews persecuted.Where there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of conscience, no freedom for women to wear what they want or do what they want.An economically wrecked Stone Age nest of barbarians whose government has spent the past  years waging war against anyone and everyone — but largely, it has to be said, other Muslim nations.Oh, and shoring up its malign influence across the whole of the wretched Middle East. And trying very hard to develop nuclear weapons so it can cause even more devastation — mainly to the area’s only democracy, our ally Israel.No wonder, then, that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has a soft spot for Iran. It hates us — and therefore the deluded halfwit is on its side. Asked about the killing of Soleimani, he denounced the USand refused to accept that Soleimani was a terrorist.Meanwhile, so-called “experts” have been suggesting Donald Trump’s missile strike will increase tensions and could even lead to a Third World War.What rubbish. As my dad might have put it, Iran doesn’t have a pot to p**s in.The same experts were saying Iran would wait and carefully consider its options before launching some devastating attack. Wrong, wrong again.It waited about half an hour before lobbing a bunch of crap rockets at US bases, which killed no American soldiers at all, according to reports.I’m not in favour of getting involved in the Middle East’s politics, unless they are targeting our people or our interests.I was against the invasion of Iraq and against the bombing of Libya. Against our involvement in Syria, too.But here was a clear case where an agent from a hugely hostile foreign government was fomenting trouble in a country — Iraq — full of US and British troops.One missile got rid of him. Another might get rid of whoever takes his place. Countries such as Iran need to know that the tide has turned. We won’t put up with their continual sponsorship of terrorism.Especially in the north of the country. This month the TransPennine service is cutting almost HALF of its trains, causing havoc for commuters. It’s offered passengers with a season ticket a three-per-cent rebate. Brilliant.Meanwhile, Northern Trains is about to be stripped of its franchise. About time. The service I use looks like it was dug up from a disused railway line in Czechoslovakia in about . South Western Railway is in trouble, too.Here’s what to do. Take them into public ownership. It’s one of the few Labour policies that the public liked. And it would prove that this is a government which will act even when it’s against the Conservative instinct.And then scrap HS and spend the money on improving the rolling stock and infrastructure between our great northern cities.Sound like a plan, Mr Johnson and Mr Cummings ENJOYING the Labour leadership contest  Never has the party seemed so hilariously irrelevant.One of the frontrunners, Rebecca Long-Baileywas asked what she thought of Jeremy Corbyn’s election campaign. She said she gave it “ten out of ten”. And kept a straight face.The worst performance in  years. Rebecca, love, the people voted in just  Labour MPs. That means they gave Corbyn less than three out of ten for his campaign. Meanwhile, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan is hoping to be deputy leader. Heard of her  Nope, me neither.She has suggested we should have a Ministry of Fabulosity, where “fabulous MPs” think up “fabulous things”. She also suggested that instead of a debate, MPs could have a Strictly-style “dance-off, because we all love a boogie”.Is she six years old  Or just out of her brainbox on horse tranquilisers This is the party, remember, that gave Britain the National Health Service, welfare state and decent education. And its leadership is being contested by people with the combined IQ of a tub of BQ tile grout.Ha.The brilliant Russian comedian Konstantin Kisin has a good answer to that: “If the Russians had been involved in Brexit, it wouldn’t have taken more than three years. It would have been one meeting – we’re out. And we’d have taken a big chunk of France with us.”TERRIBLE news. The left-wing journalist Owen Jones has announced he will be cutting back dramatically on the time he spends talking utter b*****ks on Twitter.What on earth shall we all do  I hope the Government might set up a counselling service for those of us grief-stricken by Owen’s decision.He does have a point, mind. Twitter is a moronic institution. It reflects the views of a tiny proportion of the people and is largely filled with obsessive maniacs shrieking abuse at each other.Twitterstorms, as they call them, matter less than a handful of dust.They are just maniacs, from the left or right, desperate to be outraged.Do yourself an even bigger favour, Owen, and leave Twitter entirely.I CAN’T quite get into Veganuary. I’ve tried – I ate some peas the other night, for example.But I can’t be doing with the ious supplements vegans have to take to stop them dropping dead.Also, vegan sausages taste like the seat lining from a Toyota Corolla.Instead, then, I’ve decided to embrace Januhairy. This is where women stop shaving their front bottoms and end up with vast thickets of undergrowth in which deer and rabbits frolic with gay abandon.Now, I was never in the habit of shaving down near my old fella. Not least in case the razor slipped. But there’s plenty of surplus hair I did keep in check – poking out of my nostrils, hanging down from my ears and sprouting from my eye-brows. I’m going to leave all that alone for a month.Soyou see an overweight northerner coming towards you, who looks like a cross between Hagrid and Denis Healey, you’ll know it’s me.IT’S Bafta time again and of course there’s the usual moaning about a lack of ersity in the nominations. Why no black actors  Why no female directors The answer to these questions might be that on this occasion the judges reckoned the best performances came from actors who happened to be white, and directors who happened to be men.Equality does not mean every single thing in our lives should be made up of an equal proportion of black people, disabled people, gay people, women and so on.Some harridan even had a go at Margot Robbie because she was nominated twice and happens to be white.

Meghan wasn’t there.I am sad to say she is the problem.When she arrived on the scene I welcomed Meghan, and the people did too.On walkabouts outside Edinburgh Castle, in Dublin and Cardf, as well as on their first official foreign engagement in Morocco, the crowds loved her.She often kept Harry waiting because she spent so long chatting to well-wishers.Meghan seemed to me to be doing incredibly well and I thought she was going to be a great ambassador for the UK.Now I am not so sure.Where did it all go wrong Their wedding, just  months ago, was spectacular.Thousands of you turned out in Windsor to cheer them in their carriage, millions more bought souvenir copies of The Sun to keep the memory of that fairytale day.On Christmas Day I watched Prince Charles walk to church at Sandringham with his grandson Prince George.I remembered how, just a year earlier, I had photographed William, Kate, Harry and Meghan all smiles.What had happened in just a year to change everything Harry and Meghan are blaming the media and have cancelled the Rota — a system where each newspaper takes a turn in covering royal engagements and shares the pictures with every publication.Now they are going to ban all newspapers except The Daily .But they should beware, theis a serious newspaper — just ask the MPs who fiddled their expenses.Andit finds the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should be held accountable for something, the paper will inevitably do its duty and inform its readers.But it can’t all be blamed on the media.The clues were there even before the couple’s wedding, when Meghan’s stepbrother wrote letters to Harry telling him: “Whatever you do, don’t marry her.”At the time we thought they had an axe to grind. Looking back, maybe they were right.There is usually a reason why someone marries with just one family member in attendance.No one could have had a better welcome into the Royal Family.Who can forget Prince Charles proudly walking Meghan down the aisle on her wedding day, or the pictures of the Queen and Prince Philip beaming at baby Archie.Despite this, the le Meghan had before is the one she would prefer.Harry is besotted with her and will do anything to keep Meghan happy.But the couple do not seem to have properly worked out their plan for the future.You cannot be half in the UK and half in America.I don’t think you can “pop in” for Trooping the Colour but not be there for Remembrance Sunday.You can’t be patrons of charities and not give them a lot of your time, they depend on royal patronage for their funding and their donations.What’s Harry going to do  Appear on TV shows  Cosy chats with Oprah  Speeches to American millionaires I suspect he will hate that.Will the Sussexes lose their titles as HRH, which bring great privilege and kudos I saw it happen to the Duchess of York. Now Fergie is on American TV flogging Weight Watchers programmes and Wedgwood china to make a living.If that’s what the future holds for Meghan and Harry it will be a sad turn of events.So don’t be stupid, Harry. When you finally spoke to the Queen and your father about your decision yesterday, I hope you listened to what they had to say.Charles is a man who, after the death of Diana and his marriage to Camilla, suffered more adverse publicity than any member of the Royal Family in modern times.He didn’t run away. He didn’t hide. He didn’t criticise. He didn’t ban anybody from the Rota.Charles and Camilla faced up to the criticism, got on with it and showed they were two people who want to do their duty for their country.No matter what bad publicity they have had, they have always looked straight down the camera and won over their critics.Harry has always said his role in le was to support his brother, so what has changed Hopefully, Prince Charles will be our king — but the reality is it won’t be a very long reign. After that William will have this almighty responsibility as monarch.I just hope this feud can end and that Harry willas a full-time member of the Royal Family to support his brother. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She will surely be wishing her grandson had the same strength.Harry knows exactly how hard the Queen works and how much she has sacriced.He was brought up in this institution — he knows the Queen is a soldier, relentless in her duty.He knew what it was about. His we, perhaps, did not. And she’s decided she wants out.We have seen the influence Meghan has exerted on Harry.She writes his speeches, she steers him in public, she called the shots over where they spent Christmas.Harry is alleged to have said before his wedding: “What Meghan wants Meghan gets.”Is that now the governing principle in his le  I hope not.He has broken with his family, and this is surely not something any of them wished.I understand Harry floated stepping down with his father several weeks ago.Prince Charles strongly advised him not to rush into any announcement but to plan how it would work and only then go public.Following this paper’s exclusive story it would seem Harry jumped the gun and caught the family off-guard. Charles will feel it as a hammer blow.How is this going to work out The Royal Family carries out a vast number of duties and engagements — take two people out of the equation and the impact on the rest is big.In , Harry had  engagements and Meghan , plus tours abroad.With them no longer available this will put pressure on an already busy Charles and Camilla, as well as William and Kate.There’s been a lot of talk of a slimmed down monarchy but how slim can it get This is perhaps why Charles urged his son to think out the decision before going public.The Queen, at , has already scaled back her engagements, although she still has a full diary.Prince Philip has retired, Prince Andrew is fired, which leaves Prince Edward and Sophie Wessex and Princess Anne.They all have full diaries as it is so it is hardly fair to ask them to plug the gap. The Royal Family works well because it is a “Firm”. Responsibilities are split, as is the spotlight.But with the Sussexes continuing to brand themselves as royals, attention will be drawn to them even when unhelpful to the rest of the family.On New Year’s Day, as William was announcing a new environmental initiative, Harry and Meghan released a picture of him and baby Archie.The baby picture made the front pages, while William made a few inches inside.We will see much more of this.

She wanted to get back ‘home’ to Archie.”He is thought to have been left with his grandmother, Doria Ragland, and his nanny.What we know so far: It comes as a Buckingham Palace source revealed the quickie orce could take days not weeks as staff were ordered to unravel dficulties resolving Meghan and Harrys future as fast as possible.Her Majesty today led a crunch meeting of the four households as she dialled in from Sandringham, Charles from Scotland, William on the phone in London and Harry speaking from home in Windsor.The Queen was left deeply upset by Prince Harry and Meghans announcement they are quitting as senior royals and moving to North America.No other members of the Royal Family were consulted before the shock statement was issued last night, and the hurt Monarch was taken by surprise.The tension and distraction overshadowed Kate Middletons th birthday celebrations, as many royals gathered at Kensington Palace today.Today a source revealed: The Queen, The Prince of Wales and The Duke of Cambridge have directed their teams to work together at pace with Governments and The Sussex Household to find workable solutions.They added: [Its] expected to take days not weeks.Harry and Meghan announced they will be financially independent in their new lives, but will still support the Queen and likely take money from Prince Charles Dutchy of Cornwall Estate.It comes after it was revealed the Queen reportedly learned of the announcement when the news broke on TV, and Charles and William only got a statement copy ten minutes before it went live.And even the Sussexes own aides were said to be stunned as they had been kept in the dark - and felt stabbed in the back as the new website was suddenly launched.A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman last night said discussions on their decision to step back from the royal family were “at an early stage”, adding: “We understand their desire to take a dferent approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.”Prince Harry reportedly defied instructions from the Queen not to announce their plans, after she requested he hold off until he talked it over with his father.And Prince Charles told his son he needed more time after he was sent a draft proposal about his future role, particularly on the issue of funding.Sources claimed the pair would be punished for rolling out their plans without warning.William had tried to build bridges with his brother last autumn, shortly after ITV aired its documentary in which the Sussexes said they were struggling with royal le.It’s understood William wanted to visit Harry at Frogmore Cottage, Windsor, but the meeting never happened.Sixth in line to the throne Harry and Meghan spoke to the Queen and senior royals over Christmas about their wish for a new role.A royal source said: “The Queen is crushed by this. She knew that they wanted some kind of change and she was trying to accommodate them.“Discussions started before Christmas and there was willingness to help.“Their statement on Wednesday, put out without anyone’s knowledge, was devastating.“Why couldn’t all this have been sorted out properly behind closed doors “They are trying to use their fame as a bargaining chip with their  own family. And it could bring down the entire institution.“Why couldn’t they have waited until Charles become King  Why are they putting the Queen through this “Remember she was dealing with Prince Philip being in hospital just before Christmas.“And Harry refused to fly back to spend the festivities with them.”A senior source told The Sun: “Their statement was not cleared with anyone. It breaks all protocol. This is a declaration of war on the family.“There is fury over how they’ve done this without any thought for the implications for the institution. The Queen is deeply upset. The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge are incandescent with rage.“Courtiers can’t believe it. There are so many unanswered questions but they’ve just up and done it without a thought for anyone .“The plan was there to discuss it and work out a way that works for everyone in the family.Harry and Meghan finally ed from their six-week break to Canada on Monday.The dramatic events that led to Harry effectively resigning from his frontline role started more than a year ago.The Sussexes were said to be unhappy soon after their May  wedding — following fallouts with William, and with Meghan’s dad Tom speaking to the Press.The Duke and Duchess said in their surprise statement yesterday evening: “After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen.It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment.We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages.This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties. Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support.”Today the Queens ex-press spokesman Dickie Arbiter argued on Good Morning Britain she will be feeling more angry than after Prince Andrews car crash Newsnight interview discussing his involvement in the Epstein scandal.And as the Palace came to terms with the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs bombshell announcement today, the official Royal Family Twitter account tweeted a selection of photos of Kate on her birthday and said: Wishing The Duchess of Cambridge a very Happy Birthday!It included a link about the Duchess and her work in the Royal Family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Privy Counsellor and campaign group Republic criticised the Duke and Duchess of Sussex for saying they would step down as senior royals - but keep a claim on the newly-refubished Windsor pad. In a statement last night the Royal couple said they would step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, iding time between the US and UK.But they added they will continue to use Frogmore Cottage ...as their official residence as they continue to support the Monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the UK.The cottage was renovated at a cost of £.m of public money between November  and March  - refurbishing and renovating five residential units to create an official residence for the couple. The refurbishment was paid for by the Sovereign Grant - a sum of money given to the Monarch from the Government which was £.m in  . The Grant is calculated based on profits from the Crown Estate, and would not have been lowerthe Royal Family had decided to spend the money for Frogmore Cottage on something . However, the Sovereign Grant is still officially allocated by the government - a sort of aposallowanceapos for the Monarch. Graham Smith, chief executive of the campaign group Republic, suggested the promise of financial independence rang hollow.He said: Itaposs not just Frogmore Cottage - theyaposre going to be relying on the politan Police to provide security.And they are going to be relying on their official title to cash in and make a profit on those official titles that they hold.  I certainly think they owe the taxpayer a refund. They have spent £.m on refurbishing their house on the taxpayer. It was going to be their home and now theyaposve decided to live where so we need that money back. They need to abandon their claim to that house. Former Lib Dem minister Norman Baker, one of hundreds of privy counsellors who advise the Queen, said the pair should repay the money. Mr Baker - who lost his seat in  - said: The taxpayer has spent millions on Frogmore Cottage for the couple on the understanding that Harry and Meghan intended to be working royals. Now they have changed their minds, Harry should repay the money spent on the house to the taxpayer. As he is worth at least £million and probably much more, and Meghan is a millionaire in her own right, they can easily afford to do so.  In general the royal family is far too large and expensive so it needs to be slimmed down. In that sense Harry and Meghanaposs decision to give up senior royal status is welcome. We need others in the royal family to follow suit and reduce the massive cost to the taxpayer.Former Labour MP Emma Dent Coad, who lost her seat last month, said: While my feelings about the institution of monarchy are very well known, clearly this young couple want to start afresh.And it would be a gesture of good faith to the public to show that they mean what they say by reimbursing the public purse for the renovation of a home that theyaposre never going to live in. People come to me with ceilings collapsing, black mould going through the walls. Their heating and plumbing doesnapost work. And the public spent £.m on renovating somewhere theyaposre not going to live in.

Sarah Clarke, a spokesperson for Unlock Democracy said this “squeezing of scrutiny” could not come at a worse time.

The Duchess of Cambridge, who turns  today , failed to raise a smile for photographers as she drove to Kensington Palace in London. In one image, the mum-of-three appears to be either shielding her face or adjusting the car visor. Kate is understood to be celebrating her big day with Prince William, and children Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, as well as other family members. However, there is no doubt Harry and Meghanaposs shock decision will be a hot topic of conversation during her celebrations. Husband William is said to be incandescent with rage following brother Harryaposs bombshell to step back as a senior royal alongside we Meghan - marking an extraordinary time in the history of the Royal Family. Royal fans have also been left reeling over the timing of the Duke and Duchessaposs announcement - hours before Kateaposs birthday - with some musing it is aposquite the presentapos. One said: They chose to make the announcement hit the press on Kateaposs birthday! Lovely present from them to her. Another wrote: Anyhow, letaposs hope Kateaposs birthday isnapost at all over shadowed today, with a crying laughing emoji.  Russell Myers, the Mirroraposs Royal Editor, added: “The world is talking about only one thing, Harry and Meghan’s decision to go on their own and leave their roles in the royal family. “Kate will be celebrating her birthday privately at home with the family and she certainly would prefer it that way given the whole furore over the Sussexes’ decision to press the nuclear button on their royal careers.” Meanwhile, the Royal Family Twitter account tweeted a selection of photos of Kate and said: Wishing The Duchess of Cambridge a very Happy Birthday!  And a new photo was also released on the Kensington Royal Instagram of Kate looking casual in jeans, a green jumper, with shirt underneath. The picture, taken outdoors, was captured by one of Kate and Williamaposs favourite photographers, Matt Porteous. It was shared with the caption: Thank you everyone for all your lovely messages on The Duchess of Cambridge’s birthday! According to reports, the Duchess of Cambridge had a private party over the weekend for her birthday. People magazine claims Kate invited a small group of family and close friends, as well as her parents.  The gathering was reportedly held at Anmer Hall which is Kate and Prince Williamaposs country home on the Queen’s Sandringham Estate. She also joined the Queen and her loved ones at church in Sandringham on Sunday morning. Daily Mail Femail Editor Charlie Lankston told Access Hollywood: “Kate, we know, is incredibly close with the Queen and with Williamaposs whole family. “Which is why she was keen to make sure that she didnapost miss that church service despite it being her kind of birthday celebration weekend.”  Kate previously faced reports of a rt with sister-in-law Meghan after the American actress wed Harry, followed by an alleged falling-out between William and his brother. Harry and Meghan also split their household from Kensington Palace, then left the Royal Foundation they shared with Kate and William. In a television documentary, the Sussexes spoke of their struggles, with Harry saying he had good days and bad days in his relationship with William.

The Queen stepping in to take immediate and drastic action to sort this mess out and to get it done without delay. After ordering her heirs to round up their teams, the phones at Number  and government departments at home and across the Atlantic will be lighting up a Christmas tree. Just  hours earlier, Buckingham Palace - who had been caught on the hoof with Harry and Meghan’s bombshell statement - insisted the situation was “complicated” and would “take time” to figure out. Then suddenly yesterday afternoon palace sources revealed instructions from the very top were to “find solutions in days not weeks.” A staggering turn of events, evenyou consider this latest crisis to envelop the royal family could seriously threaten its actual survival. In the palace the feeling of fury is palpable, the sadness felt by the Queen, heart rending. Harry and Meghan have seemingly hoodwinked the monarch and strong-armed the rest of the family to get what they want - and for what reason   Surely it would have been better to have everyone on board so they can help with what will undoubtedly be a tricky transition from full-time royal to part timer. But the bottom line is there are no winners here. The Sussexes seem even further ostracised from the family and, perhaps, the British public will start asking why they are paying for a couple who have neglected the very thing the Queen has placed above all  during her reign, duty.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIn the early hours of August , , the Queen sat in her dressing gown at Balmoral Castle beside a sobbing Prince of Wales. They had just been informed, via a call from Paris, that Princess Diana had been killed in a car crash. Despite being numb with shock, the monarch’s first thought was to protect her grandsons William and Harry, whose lives were about to implode. She persuaded Charles to wait until morning before breaking the shattering news and ordered that all radios, TVs and newspapers be removed to shield the young princes. Then, rather thanto London to mourn with her subjects, she stayed closeted in her castle and tried to support “those poor boys”. It was one of the rare occasions when the Queen put family before duty – yet it led to a national outcry and accusations that she was distant, unfeeling. But it also sparked a touching new relationship with Diana’s boys and a special affinity with -year-old Harry, so patently damaged by his mother’s death. “Granny” became the most important female role model in his le until he met his future we Meghan. His nanny Tiggy-Legge Bourke was the cuddly surrogate mum – but the Queen was a counsellor, adviser and inspiration. She shared his love of country pursuits, his passion for the military and his impish sense of humour. Who can forget them both glowing with pride at Harry’s Sandhurst passing- out ceremony in  or the cheeky looks between them in the video he persuaded her to make to promote his Invictus Games in   “I absolutely adore my grandmother,” he said in an interview marking her th birthday, “but I always view her as the Queen – the boss.” When viewing footage of the -year-old Princess Elizabeth pledging her le to the service of the Commonwealth, he declared: “It’s a hugely moving speech.  “It’s incredible to know that someone at that age appreciated and understood exactly what was expected of them. To basically put duty ahead of everything  so early in her le is quite remarkable.” But Harry seemed to have an equally strong sense of duty, serving his country in the Army then forging a role as a Commonwealth Youth Ambassador with his new bride Meghan Markle . Ah yes – Meghan, the “breath of fresh air” we all took to our hearts when we saw how she had captured Harry’s. The orced, mixed-race, US actress and humanitarian who would aid the monarchy’s modernisation and give Harry the family and sense of purpose he craved. No wonder the Queen looked so delighted when the Duke and Duchess introduced her to their baby Archie. Poor lost Harry had found his other half, his happy ever after. So how can it be that, eight months on, he appears to have totally lost the plot  How could he have defied his Granny – his “boss” – with such callous disregard for her feelings, not to mention those of his father and brother  The -year-old Queen is left feeling angry, wounded and betrayed by the Sussexes’ arrogant attempt to create their own brand of royalty.  A move apparently prompted by the pair’s perception that Meghan has been “bullied”, “hounded” and “vilied”. When it looks to be more about her need to own the limelight, rather than take second billing to future Queen Kate and for them both to make a fortune out of Hollywood-style celebrity status while playing at saving the planet. Harry is so besotted with his older, charismatic, psychobabble-spouting we that it seems his personality is subsumed into hers. This fun-loving bloke has become the Prince of Woke and, while Meghan may have opened his eyes to many important issues, you can’t help feeling he has lost his sense of self. A former friend of his told me: “We all know people who’ve met a new partner and begun to distance themselves from old pals and relatives, becoming part of the other’s circle. “But when Meghan got engaged to Harry she cut herself off from family and old mates – and the only friends at their wedding were her A-list celebrity ones. “Now she and Harry are cutting themselves off from his family – yet expect to keep all perks and privileges, because being royal is their big selling point.

Harry and Meghan, who are stepping back as senior royals, have announced their intention to become financially independent, while still continuing to support the Queen. David McClure, a royal finance expert, said: I donapost think it is going to work to be honest. It hasnapost been coordinated with the Palace who were blindsided by the announcement. The history of senior royals making money - the two is a toxic mix. It hasnapost worked well in the past. In , the Earl and Countess of Wessex stepped down from their businesses to become full time royals after they were accused of cashing in on their royal status. Sophieaposs bid to win business from a bogus Arab sheikh for a public relations firm triggered a major review of the royalsapos commercial conduct. Mr McClure added: How can you be half in, half out - half the week perform public duties and the other half earn your own income with TV, lectures, books  It is fraught with dangers.  What happensone of them is sponsored by a tobacco firm or something like that  Mr McClure said it was likely the couple would face a public backlash regarding the taxpayer-funded £. million refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, with the couple now saying they will split their time between the UK and North America. If theyaposre going to spend signicant time in Canada, theyaposre not going to spend so much time in this beautully refurbished Frogmore Cottage, he said. I can see people legitimately kicking up a fuss about that.  Security, which costs the taxpayer in excess of an estimated £ million a year for the royal family as a whole, will also still fall to the British public to fund, according to the coupleaposs website which says they are classied as internationally protected people requiring armed security. Additional security costs are likely as the Sussexes travel back and forth to Canada. Mr McClure said: You canapost really have your cake and eat it. At some point, theyaposll have to decide whether they want to be inside or outside the royal family. Public relations expert Mark Borkowski has predicted the Sussexes stand to make a fortune due to the demand for their brand in countries such as China, India and the US.  But Buckingham Palace has already warned these are complicated issues that will take time to work through. Harry inherited nearly £ million from his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, but this will have grown with investment. He took control of the capital share of the sum when he was . William and brother the Duke of Cambridge also inherited Dianaaposs dresses, including her famous ivory silk wedding gown, as well as her tiaras, other priceless jewels, family paintings, letters and home movies.  Harry is thought to have received money from the trust fund left by his great-grandmother the Queen Mother when she died in , but the exact amount is not known. Mr McClure said he estimated Harryaposs wealth as between £- million, while he suggested former actress Meghan was worth £- million, which could be up to £ million in total. The duchess pocketed a reported £, per season for six runs of the legal drama Suits, as well as earning an income from feature films and fashion collections. Mr McClure said it was also a possibility the Queen could have already gted some of her wealth to her grandchildren including Harry.

The couple held a series of heart-to hearts after agreeing they “couldn’t continue under the microscope of royal le”. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex put their plan into overdrive in the last six weeks after speaking to advisors linked to Hilary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey, before pressing the nuclear button on their royal careers. They kept the developments from the Queen, Prince Charles and Harry’s brother William while enlisting the help of a select band of advisors in the UK and America. The result to effectively resign from ‘The Firm’ and announce their new path without consultation has been met with “dismay and fury” inside the palace walls.  A well placed palace source said: “This all stems from their tour in South Africa. “Harry was the driving force behind it and was adamant there was no way back. He saw Meghan was struggling and told her he didn’t want to do another tour with the press and they would go their own way. “Meghan had already made the moves with contacts in America to launch their ‘brand’ and provided the avenue for it to happen. “After just  months of marriage, it was decided they couldn’t continue under the microscope of royal le and would leave on their terms.” The couple stopped communicating with their press team in the UK and instead launched their strategy to ditch their royal roles opening the door for them to earn millions in the corporate world. Sources say they will now split their time between the UK and Canada and are even considering home schooling their eight month old son Archie when he is ready. They have suggested they will dramatically scale down the number of official royal engagements on behalf of the Queen and instead turn the focus onto developing their personal foundation. Here we look at the obstacles that may face them as their embark on their new royal le: MONEY:    Harry and Meghan are worth £million in their own right and yet still received public funds from the Sovereign Grant. Harry was left £ million from his late mum Princess Diana’s estate and around £million from the Queen mother when she died. He also receives an yearly allowance from Prince Charles while Meghan was a successful TV actress before she met Harry. The Sovereign Grant is collected from the profits of Queen’s property portfolio - the Crown Estate - which are paid to the Government. Twenty-five per cent of these profits are paid to the monarchy to fund the upkeep of its property, travel, security and staff.  More than £. million was used from fund to do up their lavish Frogmore Cottage home, while the run their offices and pay for their travel on official engagements. The couple still plan to carry out some engagements on behalf of their team but have not yet devised a way of paying for it - unless they start signing mega-money deals with big corporations. Harry also receives up to £.million annually from his father’s royal estate, the Duchy of Cornwall. Palace aides have refused to say whether he will continue to take the money, which suggests the couple’s claims of being “financially independent” are far from clear. Senior palace sources say there is “huge implications of them entering the corporate world on their own accord” and the couple have not explained how they see this working. SECURITY:    Meghan and Harry have “failed to answer the simplest of questions” relating to their security provision, according to well places sources. They expect they will keep their state-funded politan Police protection officers who are paid for by the Home Office - with the bill topping £,-a-year. With overtime, travel and accommodation expenses this would likely reach £million. The issue of the Sussexes splitting their time between the UK and North America has given “major headaches ” to government departments on both sides of the Atlantic. Again, it is understood Harry and Meghan have not come up with suggestions as to how their security would be paid for. THE ADVISORS:  The couple have been working with the controversial US PR company Sunshine Sachs and will launch the Sussex Royal Foundation in the coming months. They employed the Clinton’s former communications advisor, American Sara Latham, last year. Despite her being a trusted and valued member of their team it is understood she was left out of key developments in the Sussexes’ plan to quit the royal family. Sources suggest she is considering her future role in the set up. Harry and Meghan also hired social media guru David Watkins, who previously worked with Burberry and Apple. THE MEDIA   SOCIAL MEDIA:  With an Instagram following of more than  million, Harry and Meghan plan to change the way they interact with royal fans. They have announced they will no longer participate in the official royal rota arrangement, agreed by the Queen and other senior royals as a way of publicising their good causes and engagements. This means they have cut out all UK media from following their work at home and abroad, choosing instead to work with publications and brands who agree to publish only favourable articles infor access. GLOBAL FAME:    PR gurus have told the couple they can become “one of the most influential couples in the world”. They have the potential to earn millions off the back of their royal titles, while suggesting they want to dramatically scale back their work at home. Harry has already worked on a mental health documentary series with Oprah set to be screened by Apple while Meghan has worked on clothing charities and guest edited British Vogue.  But palace insiders have questioned how the couple can realistically straddle the corporate and royal world when they will be potentially earning millions and continuing to represent the Queen on official engagements. Sources suggest in its current format the Sussexes’ plan “represents a massive conflict of interests and will no doubt cause problems for the reputation of the family”.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry could lose their taxpayer-funded politan Police Royal Protection after their shock announcement they are stepping back from being senior royals. A senior source has told reporters that Scotland Yard is to conduct a full review into whether the pairaposs change in circumstances mean they will continue to be classied as aposinternationally protected peopleapos. Their official roles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex means they, along with their son Archie, receive the protection of six full time politan Police bodyguards, as mandated by the Home Office. Each bodyguard earns an estimated £, a year including overtime - a hefty £, bill that the taxpayer foots. But a senior source has now told the Evening Standard that, while that remains the case for now, as the circumstances have changed there will now be a full review. The source told the paper: “If the Sussexes intend to live abroad, and not just carry out international official visits abroad, it will involve far more resources. This will have to be reviewed and signed off by the Commissioner. There is no guarantee it will be granted.” It is not clear what the security arrangement will be when the family are spending their time in North America, as they plan to do in the future. When Harry was visited Meghan in Canada during the early stages of their relationship, security officers outside her apartment were thought to be Canadian and therefore funded by the countryaposs taxpayers. During their six-week holiday in Canada this Christmas, itaposs reported that Scotland Yard assigned  officers and replacements had to be flown into the country, the Evening Standard reports. It is reported that the allocation of resources some disquiet in Scotland Yard. And another source told the Standard this allocation of resources was simply not practical going forward given officers working in the department have families and private lives to consider too. A spokesperson for Met Police simply said: “We never discuss matters of security.”  A statement published on Harry and Meghanaposs website last night reads: The provision of armed security by The politan Police is mandated by the Home Office, a ministerial department of Her Majesty’s Government, responsible for security and law and order. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are classied as internationally protected people which mandates this level of security. The statement goes on to explain how the couple will be funded in the future. It states that % of their office is paid for by the Sovereign Grant, with the money to be phased out this year.  It is unclear whether the couple will be cutting off all their financial ties to the royal family. Since the establishment of The Office of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex,  percent of the funding received for their Office expenditure is derived from income allocated by HRH The Prince of Wales, generated through the Duchy of Cornwall, the statement on their website reads. This provision has been in place since Prince William and Prince Harry first established their offices in support of The Queen, and is the responsibility of The Prince of Wales. This information continues to be available on The Duchy of Cornwall website.

A spokesperson for the London attraction said the Duke and Duchess of Sussex shocked the nation last night and claims their waxworks have been removed from the Royal Set with immediate effect and to reflect the upcoming change in the Royal line up. The works had stood to the left of the Queen and Prince Philip, with Prince William and Kate to the right. But they have now been separated from the family to mirror their ‘progressive new role within the Royal institution’, said the spokesman. Steve Davies, General Manager at Madame Tussauds London, said: Alongside the rest of the world we are reacting to the surprising news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be stepping back as senior Royals. From today Meghan and Harry’s figures will no longer appear in our Royal Family set. As two of our most popular and well-loved figures they will of course remain an important feature at Madame Tussauds London as we watch to see what the next chapter holds for the them.” In Augustreported how Madame Tussauds has separated its waxwork models of Meghan and Harry - moving the Duchess to be in another room next to showbiz royalty including Tom Hardy, the Beckhams and Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Her new position was intended to reflect her A-list roots rather than her royal status. Harry was set to rejoin the rest of the Royal Family. At the time Mr Davies said it wasnapost necessarily forever and the intention was to allow Meghan to mingle in her more-familiar celebrity circle for a while.Meghan and Harryaposs figures were  officially unveiled in May  ,  days before the coupleaposs Royal Wedding in Windsor, and are dressed in the outfits they wore to announce their engagement.

Harry and Meghan announced yesterday that they are to step back from being senior members of the Royal Family and will ide their time between the UK and North America. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex released a bombshell statement announcing their controversial plans, without consulting any other members of the Royal Family.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIt’s approaching midnight inside Leicester Royal Infirmary, and -year-old RAF hero Stan ­Solomons is still waiting on a ­trolley. He’s been here for almost  hours, admitted to AE via ambulance at around midday. Stan, who trained at the ­codebreakers’ HQ Bletchley Park during the Second World War and went on to serve with the RAF and later at a ‘listening post’ in Hong Kong, is not one to complain, but his feet are hanging off the edge of the trolley. “I grew up in the years before the NHS was set up, when healthcare was ‘hit and miss’,” Stan says. “My ­generation built the NHS to take the worry out of being ill, and to make sure that everyone has access to good quality healthcare.” Yesterday shocking new figures showed a record collapse in ­emergency care across the NHS – with Stan just one of tens of thousands of people left on trolleys. In December, the number of people waiting four hours or more on hospital trolleys reached , while , people waited more than  hours. Both figures are the highest on record. Stan is at pains to stress how “caring the staff are and how hard they work for their patients”. But he says they are “overworked and stressed”.Health Secretary Matt Hancock visited the hospital on December  – the day before the general election – to “see the impact that the new AE has had, just incredible impact”.But by December , when Stan faced his -hour ordeal, the election was over and the spotlight had faded.Election victor Prime Minister Boris Johnson was already on a £,-a- week holiday on the private island of Mustique. Some , miles away back home, Stan lay on a trolley. Born in , he grew up in the East End of London. “He was evacuated during the war, but like many children ed just in time for the doodlebugs,” his daughter Rachael Ellis, a social worker, says. “His own home experienced bomb damage with Stan and his family living in half a house until they could move where.” Stan has had an ­incredible le, eventually becoming a teacher, studying for a PhD in retirement and has been married for  years to Bette. But now, he needs the support of the NHS. On December , paramedics rushed him to hospital after he became very unwell with a suspected infection. He was admitted to AE just before midday. From .pm until pm there was a power cut, caused by an underground cable fault, which meant some ambulances were erted to other hospitals and that some equipment couldn’t be used. “AE was packed, with people sitting on the floor,” says Stan’s ­granddaughter Roxanne Ellis, a Labour and Co-operative councillor. “Staff were having not only to reassure distressed patients and family members but also cope without  their usual back up and information.  “We were told there was no bed available for Stan. He was fth on the list of older people waiting for a bed and th overall. While Stan did not complain – that’s not in his nature – he was clearly very uncomfortable. “The trolley wasn’t long enough, his feet were hanging over the edge and he kept sliding further down needing assistance to get back. Meanwhile, he was steadily getting more poorly and became delirious. “We don’t want to criticise NHS staff, who in our view were doing an amazing job under very dficult circumstances. The only reason the NHS hasn’t failed has been due to the overwhelming commitment of the staff.” Jonathan Ashworth MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, is also the local MP for Leicester Royal Infirmary. “Stan’s case is yet another heart-breaking example of how our NHS has been plunged into total crisis under the Tories,” he says. “Years of cutbacks mean unacceptable misery for patients like Stan who deserve so much better. “The worst AE figures on record and almost , patients waiting on trolleys is a badge of shame for the Tories.

I checked my own and realised they looked like two bald babies - or Phil and Grant Mitchell. This was several years ago and since then Iaposd forgotten about it really.  She recently showed her talented knees to a friend who works in digital media and they were very impressed, reports Plymouth Live. Holly said: They were like aposOh my God, thataposs amazing!apos. We got chatting about it and I made a couple of funny videos of them having conversations together - people seemed to find it funny. People started asking Holly about her unusual skill, prompting her to get the Mitchells out. She said: Itaposs not always as good as it is in the videos - the lighting in my bedroom where I film them is just right. Iaposve got them out at parties before and it just doesnapost work - I look like a right lemon. Holly says she is considering the next chapter in her Mitchell brother knees story, with a few ideas being thrown around.

However, Dark Blues keeper Jack Hamilton gathered the header comfortably.Hamilton then made a smart stop from a whipped Keatings free-kick minutes later as the visitors continued to push for the opener.On  minutes Charlie Trafford forced a routine save out of Hamilton before, just a minute later, Inverness got the goal their play deserved.In acres of space down the right, full-back Shaun Rooney had the freedom of Dens Park to pick out Doran in the centre of the box and the Irish attacker duly lashed home from  yards.On  minutes, ICT were two to the good. From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Meghan-and-Harry-1-752x564.jpg ","title":"harry and meghan to step down as senior royals how do you feel about the monarchy","story":"News that Prince Harry and his we Meghan Markle are step back as ‘senior’ members of the royal family and work to become “financially independent” has caused controversy at a time when the monarchy comes under increased scrutiny.The royal family are said to be #hurt# at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex#s announcement they will step back as senior royals.Prince Harry and Meghan did not consult any senior royal before making the statement, it is understood # including Harry#s grandmother, the Queen, or his father Prince Charles, heir to the throne.The statement from Prince Harry and Meghan said: “After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.“We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the royal family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty the Queen.“It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment.“We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages.“This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.“We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties.

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in .

Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in

And such a lot she had to be angry about, and such a lot we still have to be angry about, particularly when it comes to men and womens equality in relationships.In one furious scene, Laurie, the March sisters neighbour and close friend, has had his marriage proposal rejected by Jo and is now moping around Paris, drinking his grandfathers money and behaving like a spoiled child.He attempts to give Amy a dressing down for her desire to marry into money she is, at that point in the film, awaiting a proposal. Amy will have none of it. There is no way, she tells Laurie, for a woman to earn her own keep. When she marries she will be the property of her husband any property she owns or money she might earn, will be the property of her husband any children she might have will be the property of her husband. Marriage removes a womans legal right to herself.\"Donrsquot sit there,\" she flares at Laurie, \"And tell me that marriage isnrsquot an economic proposition.\"There is the most obvious change between then and now. Women now earn their own keep. Their children belong to them, their property belongs to them. These are changes made more recently than its comfortable to think about, but they are changes the March girls would be astounded by.Marriage was a system designed to control and subdue women, and to limit their economic power.But marriage is still an economic proposition. Marriage comes with great financial risk for women. They are more likely, when children enter the equation, to give up full time work and so limit their earning potential and their pension contributions.According to the Chartered Insurance Institute, the average orced woman has less than a third of the pension wealth of the average orced man.Repeated studies have shown that the benefits of marriage for men far outweigh the benefits for women. Married men are likely to be in better physical and mental health than their single counterparts, have more money and have greater social support networks.For women, there is very little dference in these measures between single and married women, apart from money, where non-married women are better off. Other studies have shown that married women report lower satisfaction levels than co-habiting or single women and are more likely to initiate orce than men.In Louisa May Alcotts Little Women, Jo quits her writing and is married off, a decision Alcott, who never married, said she regretted. Jo should have remained a \"literary spinster\". In Gerwigs film, Jo is given a book.\"What I was trying to reverse-engineer,\" she said. \"Was this moment that Jo getting her book would make the audience feel like you usually feel when the heroine is chosen by the hero. I wanted to seeI could create that feeling, but with a girl and her book.\"It is a perfect ending to a feminist, questioning film. But, in real le, imagine we could move beyond an either or choice for women where a relationship is not a stymie to her creative output or stem from an oppressive institution.Couples are increasingly turning their backs on marriage. Co-habitation is the fastest growing type of relationship in the UK where the number of co-habiting couples has doubled to . million in  years.The risks for women, though, are even greater in an unmarried partnership. There is a general misconception that co-habiting couples have legal rights similar to those of married couples, leaving women and their children vulnerable.In England last week the first mixed-sex civil partnerships took place after a law change brought about following a y campaign by a couple, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who wanted a system that gives them legal protections without the patriarchal baggage of marriage.This is common in other parts of the world - from de-facto rights in Australia to Frances civil solidarity pact and mixed-sex civil partnerships in Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand and the Isle of Man.Here, the Civil PartnershipBill is making its way through parliament to make mixed-sex partnerships legal in Scotland. Around , mixed-sex couples are expected to form civil partnerships next year.For feminists, for the non-religious, for those who want a new structure within which to define their relationships, this is an exciting development and it will be interesting to see how a civil pact, rather than a marriage, changes the way women feel and thrive in their relationships.The ambition of civil partnerships is to create true equality. If the much-adapted Little Women reflects how society feels about women at any given time, perhaps the next iteration will see Jo end up with both her novel and an equal match."},{"url":null,"title":"bafta-nominations-full-joker-leads-11-nods","story":"Scorsese.

How could it be, given what she has been through Having alleged she was gang-raped by a group of Israeli youths, the woman says she was pressured by police into retracting her statement. She then found herself in the dock, accused and convicted of lying.Now she has a criminal conviction and has been diagnosed as suffering Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Footage of her is circulating on the internet. To think her adventure of living abroad for a season started with such hope.There are many disturbing aspects to this case, not least what it has revealed about the standard of justice that exists in Cyprus. Being questioned for eight hours without a lawyer present, harangued by a judge, it was asthe clock had been turned back  years.: Cyprus backs its courtsThen there was the initial treatment of the woman and her family when they tried to get help. The Israeli youths were given immediate and effective consular assistance, but it was not until the teenagerrsquos plight was exposed in the British media that the Foreign Office really started to get its act together.It is not unknown for UK citizens finding themselves in trouble abroad to be treated as an embarrassing problem to be cleared away as quickly and quietly as possible. The Foreign Office prides itself on taking a softly-softly approach in dficult circumstances, but that does not always work.To his credit, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, appears to have flexed more diplomatic muscle and exercised more savvy than some of his predecessors.If only a previous incumbent of the office had done the same in the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe. A better Foreign Secretary might have helped to free the British-Iranian mother from jail in Iran. Instead, through laziness or incompetence, he made her situation worse. Whatever happened to that clown  Oh yes, he became the British Prime Minister.Another troubling facet of this case is what it says about some young adults and their attitudes towards sex. Sex is seen not as a private matter but as a show to be filmed and shared. Those involved in the Cyprus incident are part of a generation that has been exposed to pornography like no other group before them. As a society I do not think we have even begun to grasp the poisonous effect this is having, particularly on girls. Porn, free and easily available to anyone with an internet connection, conditions boys into thinking of women as commodities. It encourages unrealistic expectations and makes both sexes think of themselves as inadequate and flawed.

No, not that one. This is the conversation where a young adult of your acquaintance, son or daughter, niece or nephew, sibling or friend, say they have had this great idea about going on holiday with their pals.

Why, then, does such a conversation leave you soaked in a clammy dread Young people today,they are lucky enough to have around them people who love and care for them, spend the first part of their childhood being told how wonderful the world is and how special and precious they are. Le is Disney, David Attenborough, and birthday parties. Then we pull them up short. Actually, kids, the world can be a rotten, dangerous place. People are not always nice and mean well, and the sooner you toughen up the better. No wonder they are confused.In some ways, todayrsquos teenagers are far more clued up than we were. They know so much about the dangers lurking out there that they can even joke about them. They are encouraged to talk, to speak out when something is wrong. Any help and advice they need is just a Google search away.But that same feeling of empowerment can blind them to their vulnerabilities, make them think that there is no situation they cannot get out of with a phone call.: Briton told she canhomeMaking mistakes is an essential part of growing up.

It was wonderful to have a mother who agonised over every scuffed knee, but a dad who would say the equivalent of, ldquoGrow a couple, son had been just as important.You see, a dad is sorely missed when your mum tells you that you donrsquot need a razor to remove the bum fluff on your face so full it could fill a scatter cushion.A dad is sorely missed when it comes to a -year-oldrsquos first date, which your mother sees as a version of Confessions of a Window Cleaner being played out in her head, when the reality is more Mary Poppins innocence.And a dad is seriously missed when you have that first beer, that rite-of-passage shared experience which mums tend to view as a sure descent into alcoholism.And what about when home conversation overflows with oestrogen  A dad would have an implicit understanding of why a young man gets all fidgety when talk in an all-female house all too often turns to soft furnishings.The science arguments for dads canrsquot be denied either.

The Aberdeen player, who turned pro in , took part in the inaugural event last year in Riyadh, which was held in the immediate aftermath of the Khashoggi killing.Over the past year Amnesty International has changed its tune on what sports stars should do when offered huge sums of money to compete in the desert kingdom.It was said they should boycott Saudi Arabia altogether but the human rights charity now accepts they will probably go anyway but while theyrsquore there they should speak out about abuses going on in the country.What chance of Mr Law taking a stand  Judging from the responses of other players, not very likely.ldquoIrsquom not a politician, Irsquom a pro golfer, said Englandrsquos Justin Rose.ldquoIrsquom not going to get into it, echoed American Brooks Koepka.Last yearrsquos winner, Dustin Johnson, said simply: ldquoItrsquos my job to play golf. And donrsquot you get paid well for it.The most unsavoury response came from the former Masters, PGA and Open champion Phil Mickelson who said: ldquoI understand those who are upset or disappointed. Yoursquoll be ok..He said: ldquoAfter turning down opportunities to go to the Middle East for many years, Irsquom excited to goplay and see a place in the world Irsquove never been.When golf writer Ewan Murray suggested Mickelson could still visit the country without doing the high-figured appearance fee and sportswashing bit he replied: ldquoI could, but given the opportunity I have to go and play and compete while visiting, your recommendation just seems stupid to me, later adding. ldquoYou do you, Irsquom gonna do me.Four-time major champion, Rory McIlroy, could not have been clearer where he stood in the issue.ldquoNo, I wonrsquot go and itrsquos % a morality issue, said the Northern Ireland player. Yoursquore dead right it is ndash just where did Mickelson leave his moral compass Tiger Woods turned down an offer of poundm to play, diplomatically saying the Middle East was too far away to travel to, and Englishman Paul Casey cited lsquounicefgoodwillambassadorrsquo. Yes, good call Paul ndash would have been tricky for a childrenrsquos charity spokesman to sportswash a country whose bombing campaign is killing all those Yemeni infants.Barring them all suddenly coming to their senses, it looks like the European Tour will go to Saudi Arabia at the end of the month, where Mickelson says he looks forward to ldquodoing my bit to grow the game in the kingdom.Somehow even more shocking is the decision by the Ladies European Tour to play in Saudi Arabia in March, given the countryrsquos appalling record on womenrsquos rights.Despite reforms giving women the right to drive and travel abroad, the oppressive male ship system still means women have to get permission from a male relative to get married or leave a shelter where they have fled to escape abuse.More than a hundred women have agreed to take part in the tournament which is being held in Jeddah. Maybe they will reflect on their decision when they realise they will have to ditch their skirts and shorts as women golfers are only allowed to wear long trousers in Saudi Arabia, despite temperatures reaching up to C in March. But at least they can now drive themselves to the golf course.Anthony Harwood is a former foreign editor of the Daily Mail"},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-consider-neer-day-trading-ban","story":"As the shop workers union protested outside Holyrood in favour of such a ban, the First Minister said she sympathised and would look at what steps the Government could take.The Christmas Day and New Years Day TradingAct  bans the opening of most large stores - defined as more than  square metres in size - on Christmas Day.It also allows Scottish Ministers to introduce a similar ban for New Yearrsquos Day, but the provision has never been used.A recent Usdaw survey of  Scottish retail staff found  per cent thought stores should close on New Yearrsquos Day to give workers more time with friends and family.At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Labour MSP Jackie Baillie raised the Usdaw campaign.She said: ldquoMany retail workers in Scotland had to work on  January instead of spending time with their families.ldquoParliament has already put in place legislation covering Christmas and New Yearrsquos Day trading that would stop large stores from opening, but the New Yearrsquos Day provisions have not been implemented.ldquoWill the First Minister commit to backing Usdawrsquos calls, to consulting on new yearrsquos day trading and to giving shop workers the festive break that they deserve Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoShop workers deserve a festive break such as the rest of us get the benefit of.

Hence independent firm Hays Travel snapping up more than  Thomas Cook shops after the latter collapsed last September.Right on time to catch this back to basics wave comes new BBC Scotland travel programme Getaways. Presented by JJ Chalmersand Holly Hamilton, Getaways is like supermarket own brand grub compared to the fancier offerings to be found where in the schedules.The primetime half hour kicked off with the programme introducing itself, somewhat riskily, as ldquothe show that goes where you want us to go.The first destination was Menorca, and very nice it looked too with its mix of beaches, harbour, and small towns to explore. Scottish viewers already picturing themselves there would have been pulled up short, however, at being told that the flight was just under three hours ldquofrom Northern Ireland. Bit of a detour from Scotland, is it not But then Getaways is a co-production between BBC Scotland and BBC One Northern Ireland, so has to apply to both sets of viewers. Hopefully holidays starting in Scotland will feature in future shows, evening out the balance, otherwise what is the point Chalmers and Hamilton made a likeable pair. She is a BBC Sports presenter from County Down, he is a former marine from Edinburgh who was injured in Afghanistan.He turns out to be a television natural, his presenting skills honed at the Paralympics and the Invictus Games, where he had previously been a competitor. Unlike other travel show hosts he doesnrsquot have what marketers call a unique selling point. He is not an actor, or a comedian, or a chef, just a husband and dad who worries about beaches becoming overcrowded, or loungers being too dear, and that is fine. Rather sweetly, he ended up sunburned. Now that never happened to Judith Chalmers. Get the sun cream on, mate, set a good example.Hamilton seemed to tire easily, though the producers did have her snorkeling, lobster fishing,at a horse show, kayaking, and shoe shopping . By the end of the break, Hamilton looked asshe needed a holiday to get over her holiday.Everywhere they went it was quiet, which pointed to filming in low season. The show did have a gimmick, with viewersrsquo opinions popping up like text messages over the pictures. As for Chalmers and Hamilton, their commentary ranged from the blandly informative to the bleedinrsquo obvious. Their ldquotop tip about the water park, for example, was that it was cheaper in the afternoon when half day prices were offered. Given only half a day would be left by then it would be a surprisethe tickets were not discounted.Proceedings took a break from Menorca to show This Morning host Eamonn Holmes on a short getaway an hour north of Belfast in County Antrim, where he used to spend his childhood holidays. A lovely place, though I suspect Mr Holmes was over-egging the pudding when he described a waterfall as ldquoNorthern Irelandrsquos very own Niagara Falls.

He helps to run the family-owned business with his father, Managing Director George Taylor.The crisps brand and Mackie’s at Taypack as a business were launched in  as the result of a joint-venture between potato farmers the Taylor family and Aberdeenshire’s Mackie’s of Scotland, which is renowned for its ice cream and chocolate.Its thick-cut and gently cooked potato crisps use the best ieties of crisping potatoes, grown on the farm, reflective of its “plough to pack” ethos.Subsequently, Mackie’s Crisps has become famous for its haggis and cracked black pepper iety, as well as launching the world’s first pigs in blankets flavour.Research on its new flavour started in earnest in  during a new product development push, after establishing Burns Night as an opening to deliver a new patriotic flavour combination.Meticulous sampling sessions helped it to master the flavour of haggis, neeps and tatties, building on its popular haggis-based flavours.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Inverurie  District Mens Shed accept the donation from Barratt Homes\"  Funding boost for Inverurie Men’s Shed viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The Mackie’s Crisps team were further convinced of launching the flavour when a student, Aileen McColm, joined the Perthshire business in  to shadow quality control manager Jamie McKell. She undertook a survey, with  respondents showing the flavour to be the favoured option for the target market. James added: “It’s been many years in the making, so we’ll be keeping in contact with our end customers and trade clients throughout to see what the appetite is like for our new flavour.“Who knows, we may even be able to expand the run to make it a permanent addition to our range. We’d also love to be able to sell bags abroad, helping the wider world to experience the taste of haggis, neeps and tatties.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ssen talk to bright spark pupils","story":"SSEN Transmission staff visited Rothienorman School last month to talk to the children about how energy works and how they can stay road safe during construction.The staff are currently working on the construction of the Rothienorman substation, which forms part of SSEN Transmission’s reinforcement and improvement of the transmission network in the North East and East Coast of Scotland.The school visit marked a busy couple of weeks for the team, following visits to the substation site by members of the local community, Fisherford Community Council and Rothienorman Community Association.During their visit they talked to the pupils about the key role Rothienorman substation will play in facilitating the connection of renewable energy to the National Grid on the North East Coast.They also showed them how the substation will help control the flow of energy across the north east, directing renewable energy generated around Peterhead, and assist with the delivery of energy to where it’s needed, while highlighting the key role SSEN Transmission plays in supporting the transition to Net Zero.Finally they used their visit to talk about staying safe around increased local and construction traffic and gave each pupil a high visibility vest and snap band to wear when travelling to and from school on dark mornings and winter nights, helping the children to “think bright” about road safety and improve their visibility to drivers on the road.Following the visit Gary Donlin, SSEN Transmission’s Community Liaison Manager, commented: “We really enjoyed our visit to Rothienorman School.“It was great to see the children so interested in finding out how energy works and the role SSEN Transmission plays in facilitating renewable generation and the transition to Net Zero.”Mr Donlin added: “We have been working closely with community since the early development of the project and this has continued into construction, it is important to us to ensure we work together to actively mitigate any impacts of the works.“We were pleased we were able to talk about keeping road safe around construction traffic and give the children high-vis to help themselves to be seen by drivers during the dark mornings and nights.”Work on the substation began in April this year and is expected to be completed in summer .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community. This is the very least that the public and our ambulance staff deserve.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Leonard’s move promises to deepen the row over indyref within Scottish Labour, with the party’s only MP Ian Murray - who is running for deputy UK leader - strongly opposed to a change in position.The debate encroached on the Labour leadership contest yesterday, with two of the MPs vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn clashing over whether a second independence referendum should take place.Clive Lewis said his party must not block another Scottish referendum and called for his colleagues north of the Border to be free to campaign for a Yes votethey wished, warning that Scots should not be “dictated to”.But Mr Lewis’ stance drew a sharp reaction from leadership rival Jess Phillips, who insisted there were “no circumstances where I think it would be better for Scotland to leave the UK”.With Labour leadership contenders having until Monday to secure the nominations of  MPs, Ms Phillips joined Lisa Nandy and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey in meeting the threshold to remain in the contest.Frontrunner and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer had  nominations as of yesterday afternoon, ahead of Ms Long-Bailey on , and Ms Phillips and Ms Nandy both on .Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has seven, while Mr Lewis - seen as an outsider in the contest - has just four.The shadow financial secretary to the Treasury said the debate over who should lead Labour in the wake of its disastrous general election result had paid too little attention to Scotland.“It is little surprise... that many Scots see themselves not as partners in a union of equal nations, but as a country shackled instead to a dysal political system that is costing them dearly,” Mr Lewis wrote in a column in The National.“Given the option to exit the UK, it is little wonder that so many now support independence and, given the prospect of at least five years of Tory rule imposing a Brexit that Scotland did not vote for, the question of independence and a second referendum is unavoidable.”He added: “It is not for me, as an English MP for an English constituency, to dictate to Scotland what that form of government should be, and there should be no question of Labour opposing a second independence referendumthere is a mandate to hold one.”Responding to Mr Lewis’ comments, Ms Phillips said: “I care as much about kids in Glasgow as I do my own kids in Birmingham.“We should be talking about things that actually matter to them: the SNP’s education crisis and rising waiting times.The Birmingham Yardley MP added: “There are no circumstances where I think it would be better for Scotland to leave the UK.”The SNP welcomed Mr Lewis’ support for Scotland’s right to hold an independence referendum.“If front bench spokespeople like Clive Lewis can respect Scotland’s right to self-determination, and understand why so many people are moving to support independence, there is no democratic reason why the UK government should attempt to block a referendum,” SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman said.Meanwhile, former Scottish First Minister Lord Jack McConnell waded into the Labour leadership contest, backing outsider Ms Nandy calling on his party to find a middle way on the constitution.The peer criticised the “knee jerk nationalism and knee jerk unionism” of the Scottish independence debate, and said Labour should be capitalising on the SNP’s domestic record, comparing the Scottish Parliament to an “incompetent” developing democracy for the “disgrace” of having passed four major pieces of legislation last year.Lord McConnell, who was leader of Scottish Labour and First Minister from  to , said he had stayed out of party elections and not made an endorsement in the  years, but was inspired by Ms Nandy’s performance at a hustings event this week.“On Tuesday night Lisa Nandy outperformed the other candidates. She was not only thoughtful but she actually conducted herself and presented herself like an inspiring leader and a potential prime minister,” Lord McConnell told the BBC’s Politics Live programme.“She’s got this concept of a new ‘red bridge’ between the metropolitan areas where Labour’s doing very well at the moment and the towns and coastal areas and some of the rural areas and post industrial areas, that concept is brilliant.”Lord McConnell added: “She’s the only one the Tories fear.”The former Scottish Labour leader also hit out at Mr Lewis’ comments on indyref.“Clive said on Tuesday night basically that Labour should give up with Scotland and have a pact with the SNP and make them the equivalent of the Scottish Labour Party, that’s not a solution to this situation,” he said. “We need to look clearly at what we’ve been saying and doing, start afresh, and rebuild the case for social justice.“There were four bills [passed] in the Scottish Parliament last year… It’s an absolute disgrace. If it was a democracy in a developing country somewhere, we would be saying it was incompetent.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parkour groups fitting tribute gets community backing ","story":"A memorial bench dedicated to a young man who died in a tragic accident last year could soon be placed in Lerwick., owned by British billionaire Sir Jim Ratclfe, at the time of his death.Northern Focus Parkour, a group Mr Connor was a part of and coached for, has now applied for permission to place a bench in the town in memory of their friend, as a “fitting tribute”.The application for the bench was discussed at Lerwick Community Council on Monday, where community councillors gave the idea their full support, with no objections.The parkour group would like to place the bench in Heddle’s Park, replacing one of the old wooden slat benches, and said it would be a “fitting tribute for friends and family of Ray to come and remember him for what he loved to do”.The spot was one of the group’s favourite places to train, according to the application, which goes on to describe the influence that Mr Connor had on people around him: “Ray was a very well liked and respected inidual in Shetland who helped the group coach around Shetland and even in Orkney at Kirkwall Grammar School with hundreds of students being taught by him.”.."},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael demands comprehensive response to soleimani assassination ","story":"Liberal Democrat Alistair Carmichael.Mr Carmichael spoke of his fears that British citizens will be put a “further risk” as tensions escalate between Washington and Tehran.He demanded a comprehensive response from the government to the deepening crisis which has led to exchanges of threats between the two countries.Mr Carmichael said: “It is hard to see what President Trump seeks to achieve by this assassination.“That is not to condone Soleimani’s past actions or, for that matter, the actions of the Iranian government.

Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable. Possibly fixable possibly terminal."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"belfast celtic contract on display at museum","story":"THE Belfast Celtic Society has revealed a further fascinating piece of local footballing history in the form of a professional contract between city’s grand old team and one of its star players. The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"discover the beauty of africa in belfast","story":"HOW Do I Pronounce Your Name  That’s a common question. No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages!

The Luos were split around the East African borders of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda South Sudan by migration southwards and during the remapping of Africa in . That’s a story for another day. Luo is among hundreds of dferent African languages and dialects spoken in Belfast. Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the ghost of policing past visits","story":"I WRITE this column on the th anniversary of the murder of Fearghal Caraher from Cullyhanna. Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/b0dc7/38849243.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Coveney_Smith.jpg","title":"dup accept governments draft agreement to restore stormont sinn fein studying text","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

Its strategic plan centres around funding for the Greater Belfast Development with no mention of its Magee or Coleraine campuses which have witnessed student numbers drop signicantly in the past five years. The University’s most recent Financial Statement for  , outlines its long-term financial strategy. UU’s five-year strategic plan ‘Five and Fty’ sets the vision and mission of the University. It states: “As Northern Ireland’s civic university, Ulster University will deliver outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership and vision needed to help our community thrive.” googletag.cmd.push It details ambitions to deliver an “operating surplus” to support a sustainable investment strategy in both the University’s physical resources and information technology facilities. This includes the generation of “sufficient cash reserves” to allow for the allocation of poundm per annum to capital projects of which poundm per annum is towards the Greater Belfast Development and the repayment of loans to fund this project. A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has urged UU to immediately hand over its lands to city-region, saying: UU is demonstrating all the hallmarks of a struggling multi-national business running down a neglected outpost. Ulster needs to hand over the lands and budgets at Magee to the city-region immediately to allow us to develop university provision here autonomously. Ultimately, we can sit and watch UU die slowly in the regions while it moves to Belfast, or we can take proper control of the situation ourselves and start building for the future, with a vengeance. googletag.cmd.push The idea of Council partnering in a multi-million pounds development City Deal with organisation such as UU is frankly ludicrous. Imagine you were about to invest poundm and performed due diligence on your partners and found out they had UUs record. You would leave the table immediately. Council must do likewise. Signicant problems The University’s approved financial strategy aimed to ensure the financial viability of UU. Any borrowings were not to exceed that approved in the Business Plan for the Greater Belfast Development and any other projects that may arise which are confirmed as self-funding. The strategy also aimed to support the development of activities that generate income for growth. However, since the   financial statement was published the Northern Ireland Audit Office released a report showing that the Greater Belfast Development has encountered signicant problems, and delays, meaning it now needs to attract substantial additional external finance to bridge a major funding gap. It is anticipated to run poundm over budget. The business case, approved in March , envisaged that the expanded Belfast Campus would be open to students in September  at a cost of pound million. Funding was to come mainly from the UU’s own reserves and external borrowing, with the Department for the Economycontributing poundm capital grant. UU has earmarked cash reserves of poundm built up since , to support the project and committed a further pound million over the next three years. This is over and above the pound.m spent by UU to date. The total cost of the project is now estimated at pound.m including  per cent VAT which is irrecoverable.

Its strategic plan centres around funding for the Greater Belfast Development with no mention of its Magee or Coleraine campuses which have witnessed student numbers drop signicantly in the past five years. The University’s most recent Financial Statement for  , outlines its long-term financial strategy. UU’s five-year strategic plan ‘Five and Fty’ sets the vision and mission of the University. It states: “As Northern Ireland’s civic university, Ulster University will deliver outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership and vision needed to help our community thrive.” googletag.cmd.push It details ambitions to deliver an “operating surplus” to support a sustainable investment strategy in both the University’s physical resources and information technology facilities. This includes the generation of “sufficient cash reserves” to allow for the allocation of poundm per annum to capital projects of which poundm per annum is towards the Greater Belfast Development and the repayment of loans to fund this project. A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has urged UU to immediately hand over its lands to city-region, saying: UU is demonstrating all the hallmarks of a struggling multi-national business running down a neglected outpost. Ulster needs to hand over the lands and budgets at Magee to the city-region immediately to allow us to develop university provision here autonomously. Ultimately, we can sit and watch UU die slowly in the regions while it moves to Belfast, or we can take proper control of the situation ourselves and start building for the future, with a vengeance. googletag.cmd.push The idea of Council partnering in a multi-million pounds development City Deal with organisation such as UU is frankly ludicrous. Imagine you were about to invest poundm and performed due diligence on your partners and found out they had UUs record. You would leave the table immediately. Council must do likewise. Signicant problems The University’s approved financial strategy aimed to ensure the financial viability of UU. Any borrowings were not to exceed that approved in the Business Plan for the Greater Belfast Development and any other projects that may arise which are confirmed as self-funding. The strategy also aimed to support the development of activities that generate income for growth. However, since the   financial statement was published the Northern Ireland Audit Office released a report showing that the Greater Belfast Development has encountered signicant problems, and delays, meaning it now needs to attract substantial additional external finance to bridge a major funding gap. It is anticipated to run poundm over budget. The business case, approved in March , envisaged that the expanded Belfast Campus would be open to students in September  at a cost of pound million. Funding was to come mainly from the UU’s own reserves and external borrowing, with the Department for the Economycontributing poundm capital grant. UU has earmarked cash reserves of poundm built up since , to support the project and committed a further pound million over the next three years. This is over and above the pound.m spent by UU to date. The total cost of the project is now estimated at pound.m including  per cent VAT which is irrecoverable.

Its exciting news for Devine, who was recently crowned Irish International Driver of the Year on top of winning the Billy Coleman Young Driver of the Year two seasons ago. Alongside co-driver Brian Hoy, in a Hyundai i R, he will compete in all rounds of the European Rally Championship in a Hyundai i R, with the pair focusing primarily on the first six rounds of the series which count towards the ERC Junior title, while also taking in the last two rounds in the hope of overall ERC points. googletag.cmd.push Devine enjoyed a breakthrough year in , setting scorching times in the hugely competitive Irish Tarmac Rally Championship while also claiming the FIA Celtic Trophy. His season was capped off with a podium finish in Rally Hungary, the final round of the  ERC and it’s that performance that has encouraged the Derry driver to undertake a full ERC campaign in . “Hungary opened our eyes last year, it was a strange kind of event but to set competitive times at that level in a new car, in horrendous conditions made us realise we can mix it at this level, Callum commented.  googletag.cmd.push I’m under no illusions about how tough this year will be, but everything is coming together at the right time to give this a go. The realistic aim will be to push on the tarmac events and keep learning on the gravel events and above all, get finishes. Points win prizes andlast year’s ERC showed us anything, it showed us that. I’m hugely thankful to everyone who’s working so hard to make this happen for us and I’m really looking forward to the season ahead. It will also be nice to continue developing alongside Hyundai, I know Hyundai Customer Racing is putting a big effort into their R car and its programs which is great, hopefully, we can take advantage of that too.” The  ERC calendar is as follows: Round : Azores Rallye , - MarchRound : Rally Islas Canarias , - MayRound : Rally Liepāja , - MayRound : th Rally Poland , - JuneRound : Rally di Roma Capitale , - JulyRound : Barum Czech Rally Zliacuten , - AugustRound : Cyprus Rally , - OctoberRound : Rally Hungary , - November Callum and Brian’s  season will be supported by FYTH, Curran Gate, The Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Customer Racing.

The term’s fund-raising activities culminated on Thursday, December  with the annual Mission Day, raising funds for the Loreto Missions Worldwide.Loreto’s Mission Day is the College’s annual fun day to promote fair trade, the Millennium Goals and the Loreto Missions worldwide. The day allows students from all year groups to become involved in a iety of activities such as quizzes, sporting challenges and games of skill, with the focal point being the Loreto Christmas Market in the College Hall. Fair Trade gts as well as pre-loved cuddly toys, books, jewellery and fashion accessories were on sale, and for some a definite highlight was the range of seasonal treats on offer in the cafeacute run by Year  students in the College’s Home Economics suite. The College was particularly grateful to McAtamney’s Butchers, who supplied bacon and sausages, and to Pappy’s Bakery Dunloy, who supplied sodas for the Cafeacute, both very generously donating the tasty treats free of charge.Students also enjoyed taking part in a range of inflatable challenges, to say nothing of the tightly-contested soccer tournament, in memory of Reece Meenan. There was also a very entertaining novelty race contested by a number of very athletic members of staff disguised in a range of Christmas costumes, which brought the morning to a very rousing conclusion.The College’s Justice League used the day as an opportunity to foreground climate change, and they worked hard to ensure that drinks containers were recycled, plastic straws and cutlery were replaced by sustainable alternatives, and that students had the opportunity to offset their meat purchases in the Cafeacute.In the afternoon, many students enjoyed forming a lively audience for Loreto’s Got Talent, organised by the College’s Head Girl, Ailbhe McGuckian and Head Boy, Aidan McFerran, along with an enthusiastic team of senior prefects, led by Shannon Dickey and Claire White as comperes. This year’s Loreto’s Got Talent competition was very tightly contested: the winner were singers Bobby and Caitlin, while the runners up were Cora Harkin and Halle Ramsay. There was a rapturous reception for aperformance by  winner Abigail McMullan, and for a group of staff members who performed at the end of the afternoon.Other activities on the day included challenges for Year  and Year  students and form teachers based on popular TV programme I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, computer console gaming competitions and Lego challenges, a smore-making room and a Live Lounge run by some of the College’s most accomplished musicians.An impressive total of just over pound was raised on the day for the Loreto Missions.Mr Michael James, Principal of Loreto College, paid tribute to all the students and staff who had worked so hard in these endeavours, under the leadership of Social Justice Co-ordinator, Mrs Lorraine McCool and Mission Day Co-ordinator, Mrs Mabel McAleese. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The policy aims to increase understanding of menopause within the workplace, reduce absenteeism and provide support to manage menopausal symptoms at work. The Foyleside Councillor said: “I am proud to have introduced this policy to Council and now to have it validated at Tuesday’s meeting.“With up to  per cent of women experiencing this natural transition currently in work, many of whom are suffering silently due to fear or embarrassment, it’s time this issue was addressed openly.“I was shocked to see how little research has been done into this matter. The statistics I uncovered revealed how much the symptoms of menopause and peri-menopause can negatively affect women in the workplace and how little support is out there by means of understanding and support. The menopause can cause women to lose confidence in their work through symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hot flushes, brain fog, exhaustion and much more, all resulting from the associated hormonal changes of the stage.“This has caused many to feel overwhelmed enough to consider either cutting hours or stopping work completely.“As a Council we can dictate and affect the policies of our organisation, therefore this is why, through a formal motion, I called for the much needed introduction of supportive services for our staff. I am hopeful that this move will act as an example to other employers in our city and district and will encourage many open conversations on a subject which has been too long ignored and avoided. “Women are an incredible asset to any workforce and we should be doing everything in our power to enable and empower them to stay there. This adoption by Council marks a further step in getting women the support and understanding they need in the workplace.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an increasingly competitive sector, university leadership reflects the scale, complexity and impact of higher education across research and teaching. The Vice Chancellor’s salary is determined by the University’s committee responsible for remuneration and governance. ‘Business needs’ In response, an Ulster University spokesperson said there are administrative staff based on each campus, with many departmental roles supporting activities across its multi campus University. She added: “As such, the number of administrative staff does not directly correlate to the student numbers on each campus. “All categories of University staff are located and distributed across campuses, depending upon business needs, operational requirements and academic or professional specialisms. “Although they may be attached to one campus for the purposes of staff records, many teaching staff are mobile and work across more than one campus. The ratio of staff to students ies, depending upon the nature of the subjects and course provision.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Departing Vice-Chancellor, Professor Paddy Nixon, was appointed and took up post of VC and Chief Accounting Officer on  July . According to the universitys latest financial statement for  , the VC earned pound, taking in benefits and employers pension contributions that rises to pound,. There are  other “high paid staff” earning over pound, per annum,  earn between poundk and poundk while the other  earn poundk-poundk. The reports states: Vice–Chancellor leads Ulster University to make a signicant social, economic and cultural contribution, helping our community to thrive and confidently supporting Northern Ireland on the global stage. In an increasingly competitive sector, university leadership reflects the scale, complexity and impact of higher education across research and teaching. The Vice Chancellor’s salary is determined by the University’s committee responsible for remuneration and governance. ‘Business needs’ In response, an Ulster University spokesperson said there are administrative staff based on each campus, with many departmental roles supporting activities across its multi campus University. She added: “As such, the number of administrative staff does not directly correlate to the student numbers on each campus. “All categories of University staff are located and distributed across campuses, depending upon business needs, operational requirements and academic or professional specialisms. “Although they may be attached to one campus for the purposes of staff records, many teaching staff are mobile and work across more than one campus. The ratio of staff to students ies, depending upon the nature of the subjects and course provision.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club Chairman has been the financial rock behind the club in recent years, and after revealing that he had increased Declan Devines budget by % earlier this week, his statement that he is going nowhere, despite his growing business responsibilities, was met with relief and delight amongst the fans, with one stating that ODoherty is the best signing that the club has ever made.ODoherty has business interests in Donegal, Dubai and America to name a few, but Derry City will always be at his heart. “I’m not going anywhere,” he said. “The only issue I have is that I travel probably about  per cent of my time but I’m here for the foreseeable future.“I’ve got three factories around the world and we’re looking at other locations around the world. But no matter where I am, I’m going to be there for Derry City.“Dodieis doing a great job running the office and Declan doesn’t need looking after. I don’t try to micro manage any of these guys, they all do their jobs.“We meet once every two or three weeks. Hecan email me or ring me anytime but in terms of face to face meetings, it’s about every two or three weeks.” googletag.cmd.push Delighted with progressODoherty brought Devine back to the club last season, and watched as the former goalkeeper, alongside his staff and a brand new playing squad, finished in fourth place, bringing European qualication and European money back to the club.I was absolutely delighted with last season, ODoherty continued. The way we ended the season before was demoralising to say the least.This manand the team he brought with him and the players he brought in did really well. They met all our expectations and more. I think were in a stronger place now but we still have a fair bit to go in terms of signings.Declans budget has been increased by  per cent on last year, he confirmed. We havent increased the ticket prices and were expecting a wee bit more sponsorship but not much more.Theres a fair amount of effort put in by the Board of Directors to basically to give Declan a bigger budget so he can compete at an even higher level than last year.Dundalk will be very hard to peg back, he added. All I can do is my bit and give hima bit more for his budget but still keep the club on a sound financial footing.Running the football club is a constant challenge for all involved, and ODoherty knows that will not change in . The Chairman though is determined to make his local club competitive.“It’s going to cost pound million to run the football club this year,” he stated. “That basically comes from contributions, sponsorship, gate receipts.“One of the disadvantages we have is we pay VAT on all our gate receipts, whether they’re season tickets or inidual match tickets. That’s a  per cent disadvantage on that part of our income. So we are hamstrung with that unlike other League of Ireland clubs because there’s no VAT on sporting events in the Republic.“Were making an effort in terms of increasing the budget and I do think we will challenge again this year.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed. This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register. However, this does not currently exist.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, a letter from the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health confirmed that there are no plans in place at present to introduce so-called opt out legislation.However, Mr Richard Pengelly said that work is continuing to achieve higher rates of donation and transplantation to ensure that more people are able to receive the gt of an organ.It is estimated that someone dies every six weeks in Northern Ireland waiting for an organ donation.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen said she was not surprised at the content of Mr Pengelleyrsquos letter, explaining that there is not much he can do without the required legislation being in place.ldquoIs there anything we can do at council level  she asked.ldquoA lot of the things we would hear on this issue from people is that it is something they have never really thought about or spoken to their family about.

Is there anything that we can do to educate people and push a bit more on this issue as far as people putting themselves on the donor register  she asked.Cllr Roisin Mulgrew said organ donation was an issue she highlighted during her year as the districtrsquos first citizen, explaining that workshops were held involving a number of young people who spoke with representatives from the ldquoBraveheart organisation.She described the event as ldquohugely successful and suggested the organ donation issue could be one for discussions across the districtrsquos DEAs.Cllr Mulgrew added: ldquoOrgan donation is a conversation families hope that they do not have to have. There is an appetite for information on this issue.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews also backed the suggestion for the organ donation issue to be discussed at DEA level and said it should also be discussed with the Education Authority and local health trusts.Council director Michael Lipsett confirmed that he will be bringing a report on the organ donation issue to a future meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.He said the report will focus on how the council is going to approach the issue and will contain information on its work with the Public Health Authority, local health trusts and Education Authority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 PSNI.jpg","title":"PSNI helicopter used in search after attempted burglaries at weekend  ","story":"POLICE have been praised for their swt response to an incident in Killyleagh last Sunday after reports of attempted break-ins at homes in the town.A helicopter was deployed as part of a major operation which subsequently resulted in the arrest of a  year-old man near Killinchy.Connor Martin Haughey, of Forest Street, Belfast, appeared in court in Newtownards yesterday charged with a series of offences including burglary, taking and damaging a vehicle, no insurance and possessing as an article with a blade or point in a public place.The case was adjourned, with Haughey remanded in custody until January  when he is due to appear at Downpatrick Court.The ious charges he faces are in connection with burglaries in the Saintfield and Killinchy areas. It is understood he was arrested after police received a number of reports of suspicious activity in the Ringhaddy area, near Killinchy.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker has praised police for their swt response to the incident and has urged people to review their home security and ensure that their front and rear doors are locked at all times.He said a suspicious car in the Grove and Kerry estates sparked alarm last Sunday with residents calling for the police who responded swtly, deploying a number of officers, including aerial support via the PSNI helicopter.ldquoI would appeal to people to ensure that their doors are locked at all times, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI would also encourage people across the district to check in with their elderly neighbours and remind them to never open their doors to strangers.ldquoPolice were swtly on the scene in Killyleagh last Sunday which was very reassuring for residents who very much appreciated the quick response, he continued.The Rowallane politician also encouraged elderly residents in particular not to open their doors to strangers.He said residents concerned about people calling at their homes should always be asked to show their ID accreditation for the organisation they claim to represent.ldquoVirtually all staff from ious organisations now carry ID cards which feature a photograph of the person carrying it.

Work in the area is expected to take around four weeks to complete.Phoenix says while it understands that its planned programme of work will cause some disruption, it will take all relevant measures to mitigate this. In addition, the company says it is pleased that the interest levels from homeowners in Downpatrick wishing to connect to the gas network have been consistently strong.In a letter to local politicians, Phoenix says that it continues to receive regular queries from householders that donrsquot currently have access to the mains network, encouraging the company to make gas available as quickly as possible.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has asked residents and commuters in the town to remain patient as work on the multi-million pound scheme continues to provide householders and businesses access to a new form of energy.ldquoPhoenix has written to residents who are most likely to be affected by the next phase of pipe-laying to ensure that they are fully aware of what is being proposed, he continued.ldquoThe company recognises that its investment does result in disruption but is quick to resolve issues when they arise. The poundm investment across East Down to deliver natural gas is very signicant.Cllr Curran also praised Phoenix for its engagement with residents and the business community as it rolls out its pipe-laying programme across the county town in particular.The Downpatrick councillor has also confirmed that he plans to contact Phoenix officials to discuss the potential for weekend working as part of the drive to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said while the arrival of natural gas has been welcomed in many quarters, Phoenix faces the unenviable task of delivering a y construction scheme while keeping residents and business owners reasonably happy.He added: ldquoThe company has done its very best to date and there is no doubt that delivering the natural gas network is challenging. It is also not without its dficulties at times due to ious factors outside the companyrsquos control.ldquoAs work continues this week and over the months ahead, it is important that people remain patient and understanding as contractors get on with the job of providing consumers with increased choice when it comes to selecting their energy provider..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Twelfth.jpg","title":"Twelfth child for Saintfield couple  ","story":"MEET the Donoghues mdash now officially the largest family in Northern Ireland.The Saintfield family entered the record books when baby daughter Molly mdash their th child mdash arrived on New Yearrsquos Day.Molly, who weighed lb oz, was born at the Ulster Hospital shortly after  noon last Wednesday.Dad Johnand mum Tessa , were thrilled to introduce little Molly to her  siblings ndash six brothers and five sisters mdash who waited excitedly to welcome her home.Saying good night in the Donoghue household sounds more like a classroom roll call.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

They’re continually digging up unexploded bombs throughout Germany. “Through in-laws of my brother, who married in Germany, I spoke to someone who was on the Russian front. I got a lot of information close to the wire plus a lot of research.“People have reviewed the book, went through it with a fine-tooth comb and commended its accuracy.”Explaining how the book led to him crossing paths with Angela Merkel he said: “Writing a period historical novel requires a lot of research for the product to be authentic enough for the reader to believe in it and to buy into the plot. “The story begins north of Berlin, at a hotel situated on the shores of Großdöllner See, in the district of New Brandenburg. It was during this time that I discovered the chancellor had grown up in the area with her family.“I sent her a letter of appreciation for her service as a politician, along with a copy of my book for her and her husband to read on her retirement.“Just before Christmas, I received a letter of thanks from her office.

Ironically, despite these comments, recent developments in the Republic of Ireland have shown us the reality that Sinn Fein and others are not really interested in equality – or the historical commemoration of anything deemed to be British.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Ms McDonald had told the Irish Independent she was willing to put celebrating the Twelfth of July across the island of Ireland on the table in talks about a future Border poll.She said “everything should be on the table” when asked specically about annual celebration.“I’ll tell you how we do it, we do it by having them [unionists] front and centre in the conversation and asking them, because I would be absolutely astonishedfor people of a unionist persuasion the issue around the Twelfth of July was not raised,” she said.“We, more than any other political party in the Oireachtas, are used to working with, living with, dealing with our unionist neighbours and the Twelfth of July is very widely celebrated.”Ms McDonald’s comments were made before the current controversy over the now-postponed Irish state commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin politan Police. Sinn Féin led calls for the event to be cancelled altogether amid concerns it amounts to celebrating the Black and Tans.While acknowledging Sinn Féin supporters may not favour marking the Twelfth, Ms McDonald believes people will “surprise themselves” with what they find acceptable in a united Ireland.“Generally speaking, people are decent and reasonable and they want a good le for themselves and for their families and they are happy to accommodate and respect their neighbours so long as that accommodation and respect comes back to them,” she said. “They’re kind of the go-to issues when people talk about Irish unity, and that’s fine. Bring all of that to the table. Let’s talk about it.”While critics claim she is not in control and Sinn Féin is still run out of west Belfast, the paper said, she insisted Gerry Adams “doesn’t pull my strings, nobody’s pulling my strings”.Ms McDonald also declined to express regret for proclaiming “up the rebels” and “tiocfaidh ár lá” when she took over as leader. “No,” she said when asked about using militant Republican language. “Up the rebels.”Gay MP Hannah Bardell to report Lord Ken Maginnis to police for calling her a queer Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"LBC journalist and NI man Matthew Thompson tweeted: “That’s nice and all.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it.

Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business. My mother always had the teapot on and we enjoyed seeing Sam arrive and giving us a bit of the fun that was part of his character.”Sam brought fun no matter where he went but he had his serious side too and his RAF training in discipline and decorum could come into play when the occasion demanded. He was comfortable in any gathering and was equally at home discussing world affairs or more mundane matters at home.People like George Allen, Ralph Loney and Mervyn Gilpin, all known for their Christian views, were among Sam’s best friends, even though he didn’t share all their views, but there was mutual respect on all sides and their friendship grew over the years.“Sam was a deep thinker and liked to argue his case,” said Mervyn. “I don’t think we ever saw eye to eye but we had a friendship that could never be broken and we all held him in the highest regard.” Sam is survived by his we, Margaret, daughter Claire, sons Reuben and Samuel, son-in-law Mark, daughters-in-law Zara and Lucy grandchildren Robin, Olivia, Alex, Rocco, Jude, Charlie and William, sister, Jeanette and brother Trevor.The funeral is to Roselawn Crematorium on Friday at pm and donations in lieu of flowers are to Help the Heroes, c oJoseph Poots funeral directors, , Bridge Street, Portadown. BT RAThe family wishes to place on record their sincere thanks to the doctors and nurses at Craigavon Hospital for all their care and attention to Sam during his short stay there.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/1578587871343.jpg--.jpg?1578587871000\\","title":"suspicious package at omagh s royal mail delivery office false alarm ","story":"The Royal Mail delivery office on Omaghs High Street was evacuated for a time on Wednesday morning following the discovery of a suspicious package.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

John Mulgrew met him at Terry’s Killaney Estate to discuss the grand whiskey and gin producing plans There’s nothing about Terry Cross and Derek Hardy’s plans for the Hinch Distillery and visitor centre in Co Down that feels like any corners are being cut.Former Delta Print and Packaging boss Terry has turned his attention to whiskey and gin with his new venture – a £m development based literally beside his grand home, outside Carryduff.Looking at a host of detailed artist’s impressions – on show inside Terry’s home – it’s clear there’s both signicant time and money being put in to the venture. It will end up as a , sq ft facility and visitor experience with a bar, restaurant andspaces.Derek is the man who will run the business. He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
