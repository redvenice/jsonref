Top of the agenda: the decision to make over-75s pay for TV licences.Understandably, this has proved a highly emotive issue. But if MPs had hoped to guilt the minister into reversing the decision, they were very wrong. Star Wars\u0027 R2-D2 has a greater empathetic range than Jeremy Wright.Not our fault, Guv. That was the gist of Wright\u0027s response. It had been the decision of the BBC, after the responsibility for free TV licences was handed over to the Corporation by the previous government.          Wright passed the buck to the BBC over the decision to revoke free TV licences for the over-75s, a move which has attracted criticismThe SNP\u0027s Gavin Newlands demanded the Government reverse the decision. At least I think he did. Mr Newlands\u0027s charming Paisley brogue is a little on the broad side. The Hansard transcribers next to me were having kittens.Wright replied that conversations with the BBC would continue. \u0027We expect them to do more,\u0027 he said stonily. Judging by the looks around the chamber, these remarks did not inspire confidence.Jessica Morden (Lab – Newport East) accused the minister of \u0027hiding behind the BBC\u0027. Not true, insisted Wright, this was the Corporation\u0027s decision to make. Then why did the Tory 2017 election manifesto promise to keep free TV licences for over-75s, asked Jim Cunningham (Lab – Coventry South).Wright couldn\u0027t answer.Wasn\u0027t it the case, asked Rosie Duffield (Lab – Canterbury) that the Conservatives were simply complacent about receiving support from the elderly at the next general election? \u0027I do not accept that for one moment,\u0027 the minister insisted.Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson took a view, too. Of course he did. You may have noticed Labour\u0027s deputy leader has lately tried to fashion himself as the Commons\u0027 conscience.\u0027Perhaps the most difficult part of growing old is the loss of a husband, wife or partner — the person you have shared your every day and every thought with, often over a lifetime,\u0027 he whispered in slow, reverent tones.         Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson has tried to fashion himself as the Commons\u0027 conscienceHe said an estimated 1.5million pensioners who have lost their \u0027life partner\u0027 could now lose their TV licence. \u0027I ask the Secretary of State, can he live with that?\u0027Meryl Streep in her prime could not have delivered a more hammy soliloquy.Was that a tear welling in eye of Watson\u0027s deputy, Rosena Allin-Khan (Lab – Tooting)? Possibly.Wright continued: \u0027How the BBC chooses to exercise its responsibility is, as it and we say, its responsibility…\u0027 Yet more lawyerly buck-passing.Strangely, there was no mention during the session of the high salaries of the BBC\u0027s top \u0027talent\u0027 which were made public this week.Instead, Hannah Bardell (SNP – Livingston) pointed out how TV audiences of more than six million had recently watched England play in the Women\u0027s Football World Cup.This made me wonder how these impressive figures were achieved without the Beeb\u0027s highest earner and its face of football, Gary Lineker – who trousers £1.75million a year – doing the presenting honours?

Thankfully, I kept my cool and the shot came off’I grew up in Adelaide, which hosted the Australian Grand Prix until 1995. I lived close to the track. From my house, I could hear the cars screeching. It was a huge spectacle and it felt as if everyone followed it in some way. I got to watch the racing on a couple of occasions, but as I grew older drifted away from the sport.Today I live in Melbourne, where the race is now held. Being here has helped me to reconnect with the sport. I knew Formula One was coming to town so I asked the McLaren team to let me shoot with them. I explained that I was interested in understanding the team, not just photographing the race. I didn’t want to shoot your typical F1 shot. I was amazed when they agreed.They let me scope out the garage and track in advance, so I had this shot composed and framed well before the race. Everything moves so quickly: without that time to plan, you’re never going to get the shot you need. I knew I would have only a matter of seconds, which is pretty difficult on the medium-format Hasselblad I use. It’s a slow camera that’s more often used for landscape photography than sport, let alone something as quick as F1.Race day is intense. It’s hot and loud and everything can change in an instant. When you get into the garage, you need to have your wits about you. It’s a high-performing team with lots of people in a confined area working under immense pressure. You might be there to get the shot – but they are there to win.I watched the race from atop the pit wall, nervously waiting for the moment. McLaren had two drivers in the race: Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris. My work depended on them making a stop, which itself depended on a bunch of tactical considerations outside my control. A mechanical fault meant that Sainz had to retire early. That left me with one chance: the only stop Norris made in the entire race. It lasted 2.7 seconds. I had one press of the button. Thankfully, I kept my cool and it came off.When most people think about Formula One, they think about the drivers. But in this shot, you have 15 guys who are immensely skilled, profoundly dedicated and critical to the success of whoever’s in the driver’s seat. They work a punishingly long season, and this captures their perfect synchronicity. There’s no space or time for ego. Everyone has to work as a unit. And this is only one aspect of a massive operation. Outside of the race team, there’s everyone who helped build the car, as well as a huge data centre in the UK monitoring race stats in real time and advising on tactics.I hope the shot is a new way of looking at the sport. A few years ago, I became fascinated with hyperrealistic painting – works you couldn’t distinguish from photographs. It got me thinking whether I could work the other way round, turning photography into something flatter, more illustrative, more ambiguous. I set out to challenge myself – physically, mentally and as a photographer. I came away from the Grand Prix a better artist.Studied: “3D animation in Adelaide, but I’m a self-taught photographer.”Influences: “The paintings of Jeffrey Smart and David Hockney.”High point: “Last year, I was named a Hasselblad Master, a dream come true.”Low point: “When I lost inspiration and stopped shooting for a year.”Top tip: “Stick with it through thick and thin. Persistence is everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7aeb3b037247228760452aaf18840841746fce6/0_46_5184_3112/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838348cf866eb6bf74fbe9da1d004c79","title":"un inspectors primed for unfettered access to australian detention centres","story":"Human rights inspectors due to visit for the first time, with the right to go into any place of detention unannouncedUnited Nations human rights inspectors will have “completely unfettered access to all places of detention” when they visit Australia in coming months.This week the UN subcommittee on prevention of torture announced it would visit six countries to inspect places of detention, including Australia and Nauru.It will be the first time Australia is subject to the inspections, which it is obliged to allow after ratifying the optional protocol to the convention against torture (Opcat) in December 2017, more than eight years after signing it. The protocol was designed to prevent the mistreatment of people in detention, through inspection processes.The chair of the subcommittee, Sir Malcolm Evans, told  Australia inspectors had “the right of unannounced access to any place of detention or any place we believe people might be being deprived of their liberty”.“Our visits are relatively short, we can’t look at everything. We have to be strategic. We will be doing our homework.”He said he was confident the Australian authorities would understand and cooperate with the inspectors’ expectation of “completely unfettered access to all places of detention, to any person, place or thing, to people of all categories in detention”.The inspectors will have a broad brief, including prisons, youth detention, immigration detention, psychiatric hospitals, police stations and social care environments such as aged care and disability homes.“The reality is these are institutions that are supported, regulated and run by the state,” Evans said. “The reality is people are being detained and subjected in some instances to forms of ill treatment for which the state would be accountable.”He said the subcommittee was particularly concerned about marginal groups in society which are often subject to poorer treatment than others for various reasons including disability, race, age and infirmity.Evans said a key issue for the subcommittee was to help nations set up their own oversight bodies with similar powers to the subcommittee.Countries were usually obliged to establish the mechanism within a year, but Australia exercised a right to delay it until the end of 2021.Evans said the subcommittee also hoped to prompt some “self reflection” about the way a country runs its custodial systems.After each visit, the committee writes a confidential report for the subject nation’s government, which it is encouraged to release.Australia’s detention facilities have been extensively criticised, and subjected to countless investigations, reports, inquiries and royal commissions.Prison populations are rising, particularly those of women and Indigenous people, in an increasingly privatised system.“Abuse thrives behind closed doors,” said Ruth Barson, a legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, welcoming the international scrutiny.“While independent scrutiny is essential to expose abuse, the onus will be on our governments to then take action and end mistreatment.”Youth detention has come under the spotlight in recent years with the Northern Territory royal commissions, and separate reports on facilities in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland, and the royal commission into aged care continues to hear shocking allegations of mistreatment of elderly residents.Australia’s immigration policies – of which detention is a major pillar – have been criticised by international human rights organisations, legal groups, the United Nations and other governments.Domestic immigration detention centres, which are federal facilities often run by private companies, have hosted multiple acts of alleged mistreatment and abuse against detainees. Human rights and legal groups have accused the government of operating without transparency, allowing alleged abuses to go uninvestigated.Australia’s offshore immigration facilities are outside the subcommittee’s mandate for its Australia visit, but the regional processing centre on Nauru will be inspected for a second time this year.Nauru was previously inspected in 2015, but Evans noted it has yet to establish the prevention mechanism, has not responded to the inspectors’ findings, and has not made the report public."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60d785fe50d1e2a71281def403c3eece01fb0a41/0_229_2562_1537/master/2562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10edbb1a56b2a9707ad8053bc49bab28","title":"george osborne must understand the imf role is no popularity contest","story":"Will the Evening Standard editor take a seat at the top table? Don’t put your money on it just yet…If George Osborne’s “friends” were not advertising the former chancellor’s interest in the top job at the International Monetary Fund, would we even take the idea seriously? One suspects not. The UK has a strong candidate to push to be managing director of the IMF. He is Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.Osborne’s claim seems to rest on the idea that the current editor of the Evening Standard is a skilful political animal who could attract votes from around the world, and thus find a way through the IMF board’s opaque selection process.Well, OK, he’s European and a European always gets the gig according to the cosy convention that allows the US a free run at the top post at the World Bank. Osborne also ticks the box that says it’s finally time for a Briton at the IMF. As for the Brexit factor, it’s an obstacle to gaining the necessary support of the EU. The fan club, however, will say it is surmountable: the UK will still be a large economy and cannot be excluded permanently from the top table.Christine Lagarde’s\u0026nbspnomination to run the European Central Bank has prompted speculation over who could replace her as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.The former French finance minister is set to become\u0026nbsppresident of the ECB from 1 November, should she win approval from Brussels. Her move will spark a round of international horse-trading over who should lead the global lender of last resort.Here are some names in the frame:Suggested his candidacy to friends.\u0026nbspThe former UK chancellor is regarded as the\u0026nbsparchitect of austerity in Britain, once favoured by the IMF but now out of fashion. Brexit could damage the chance of a Briton winning support from other nations. However, Osborne has close ties with China and the US and was a backer of Lagarde.Governor, Bank of EnglandCanadian by birth, the Bank’s governor also has UK and Irish citizenship.\u0026nbspDue to exit Threadneedle Street\u0026nbspat the end of January, he has experience in international circles, having led the G20 Financial Stability Board. Highly regarded, he has\u0026nbspmoved to fight the climate crisis\u0026nbspand his speeches chime well with the IMF’s outlook.The Italian economist could complete a job swap with Christine Lagarde when he leaves at the end of October. He was influential in\u0026nbsppreventing the breakup of the Eurozone. Aged 71, the IMF would need to change a rule that managing directors must be no older than 65.The former Indian central bank governor was previously chief economist at the IMF. Appointing him would prove symbolic: dismantling the tradition of a European leading the fund and recognising the rise of Asian economies. Rajan is also seen as a\u0026nbsppotential successor to Mark Carney at the Bank of England.General manager, Bank of International SettlementsThe Mexican economist is well regarded in international circles for his work at BIS, the central bankers’ bank. The unwritten code that a European leads the IMF could stand in his way. The former finance minister and head of the Mexican central bank has\u0026nbspruled himself out to succeed Carney.The Bulgarian economist\u0026nbspwas previously vice-president of the EU commission and currently runs the IMF’s twin institution, the World Bank, under its American president –\u0026nbspDavid Malpass. A close connection to EU politics would help her candidacy. Richard PartingtonAnd Osborne may think he can raise a cheer in Beijing since, in office, he was fond of giving speeches about “a golden decade” in UK-China trade relations, even to the point of funding our nuclear power stations with cash from the Chinese Communist party.Come on, though, Osborne at the IMF sounds a stretch too far. The main problem isn’t the fact the IMF’s economists regularly objected to the austerity policies he pursued as chancellor. Among the chummy Davos brigade, ideological clashes can usually be quietly forgotten. Rather, the main issue is simple: Carney is just a bigger figure on the global stage.The governor has headed two central banks – the other being the Bank of Canada – and was chairman of the Financial Stability Board, the body that has done serious work behind the scenes in clearing up the mess of the 2008-09 crash. On the climate crisis, an area where the IMF is more vocal, you’ll find more serious thinking in Carney’s recent speeches than in any of Osborne’s budgets.The governor’s CV will be more attractive to other EU nations, without whose support no London-backed candidate will get far. Carney can also wave Canadian, Irish and British passports, which covers several bases. We don’t know if he is interested in the job but, if he is, he could easily win the contest. Osborne looks an extremely long shot.What’s got into the water at Ofwat?The regulator has recently told four water companies – including Thames, Anglian and Yorkshire – to sit in detention until they can do their homework properly. The company’s first submissions of its business plans for 2020-25 period were deemed inadequate, and now the re-jigged versions have also failed. The firms have been given a fortnight to do better.Has Labour’s nationalisation agenda provoked a tougher approach on the part of a regulator that has rightly been accused of timidity in the past? Actually, no, it would be wrong to read too much into this tale. The simple explanation is probably correct: the four laggards are just less efficient than their rivals and deserve a good kick.Remember that the three stock market companies – Severn Trent, United Utilities and South West Water, which is owned by Pennon – all scored top marks for their business plans at the first attempt. Ofwat says the others have “not yet risen to the challenge”.This is roughly the way the regulatory system is supposed to work: in the interest of keeping bills down, inefficient firms have to catch up with the leaders. The losers in the process would probably love to blame their woes on the idea the regulator has become politicised. They should look in the mirror.The bookmakers says it could close 700 high-street shops, putting 4,500 jobs under threat. Across the industry, a quarter of premises could close. William Hill will blame the cut in maximum stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals from £100 per spin to £2 and, on a short-term perspective, it would be right. The machines used to generate half the income in the shops.On a long-term view, though, this day was always coming. The machines had been clearly become a social blight and the bookies, even when evidence of harm piled up, did too little to reform themselves. Change is terrible for low-paid employees, but it had to happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9008715027da3a0c453d9f1ec30993936ff4cd2d/0_178_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef4a4354a365f43fac5c550f479b0740","title":"paul goldberger ballpark baseball american city","story":"To the critic and author of Ballpark: Baseball and the American City, the buildings dedicated to the game are as essential to American society as they are symbolic products of it“The ballpark,” Paul Goldberger says, “is a symbolic resolution of two things that remain unresolved in American culture.”The Pulitzer-winning critic is referring to urban and rural life, the city and the country, tensions he explores in his new book, Ballpark: Baseball and the American City.It is an engrossing read, starting in the teeming 19th century, soaring through baseball’s gilded age in the first half of the 20th and ending among the roofs, aircon and policed corporate spaces of the new millennium. It’s a work of architectural history and criticism but it can also be read as a history of baseball or of America and its cities. To Goldberger, the game and the buildings dedicated to it are as essential to American society as they are symbolic products of it.Discussing baseball’s beginnings, Goldberger says: “It did not spring like Athena from the head of Zeus.” It’s an appropriate phrase, as he’s speaking from a Greek island where he’ll deliver a lecture.Versions of the game came together over time. The familiar story that baseball was devised by Abner Doubleday and “played in the fields in Cooperstown, New York”, Goldberger says, is “a longstanding myth that has its roots in a very conscious attempt in the late 19th century to position the game as connected to a more elite and already vanished America”.As he shows, much early baseball was in fact suburban, played in “elysian fields” nonetheless close to the margins of cities. It was rackety and contradictory and competing groups fought to exert control. Like America itself.In the early 20th century the game shifted gears, building beloved city ballparks like Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn and Shibe Park in Philadelphia. Both are gone but in Chicago and Boston, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park continue to pull in the fans.Then came the mid-20th century when the game went national, the stakes were raised and what Goldberger calls “concrete doughnuts”, multi-use stadiums that sacrificed character to the car in seas of suburban parking, were the decidedly soulless result.Baltimore plays a key part in Goldberger’s book, its ballpark, built in 1992, showing how the game returned to the cities.“All types of buildings evolve,” he says. “Airports, hospitals, houses, schools and so on. But they generally evolve in fits and starts and steps, not in one single project after which everything else is completely different. But that certainly was the case with Camden Yards.”Oriole Park at Camden Yards, to give it its full name, replaced Memorial Stadium, a towering suburban venue. The new building did not have to host football too so its architects considered the best of traditional ballparks as well as the fans and their corporate masters. They took an industrial site in a post-industrial city and used it without sacrificing heritage or history.Camden Yards is on an old rail site, which leads to another key point.“While the railroads did not need baseball,” Goldberger says, “baseball needed the railroads. At first the various teams around Brooklyn and New York all played each other and could easily organize that. But you couldn’t organize a regular league with teams in Philadelphia playing teams in Cincinnati, which in turn would play a team in St Louis and Chicago, and Boston, and so forth, without the rise of inter-city train travel. So they went hand in hand.At the end of his book, Goldberger considers the privatisation of public space, a concern in many cities today. He casts an eye over SunTrust Park in Atlanta, an exurban setting where the Braves have built a facsimile of an urban space, ersatz, controllable and financially worth their while.Back in New York, there’s Hudson Yards and a ballpark that never was. The Yankees and Mets looked at the railroad site on the west side of Manhattan but nothing came together. What did open this year: a mesh of condo towers and malls with a sculpture dropped in the middle.Goldberger contends that unlike condos, offices and malls, “baseball integrates beautifully into cities”, which is “really the essential point of the book”. In short, he wishes the Yankees or Mets had succeeded.“I would love to have seen it,” he says. “It would have inoculated the developer very successfully against the not unreasonable claims that Hudson Yards is an enclave for the rich. It would have created a far better reason than Thomas Heatherwick’s sculpture for people to show up, to come there and walk around.“It would’ve left plenty of room for gazillion-dollar condos. It would not have gotten in the way, it would not have presented the programme of Hudson Yards that we now see. It would’ve just been integrated a little bit more effectively, you know?“Imagine if we had had a ballpark instead of a shopping mall, which is the last thing anybody needs or wants.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b821d9772b2dcb264d0aeee42cc0b3ed1afb6d/0_315_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a42cff05c8b572a6abfeb492a76c4eb3","title":"how paris defence zone grew into shantytown in pictures","story":"Exhibition of archive photographs shows how strip of land around Paris, established in 1844 as a defence initiative, became home to 40,000 peopleThe Zone at the Gates of Paris is on display at Croisière, at the Rencontres d’Arles, until 22 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d1be2855651d2aaa11ea41cabd00482cf4348dc/0_197_4760_2855/master/4760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46f7e553681fc830468ac81b15be6435","title":"hong kong jeremy hunt britain rules waves wrong","story":"It was June 1997 and I was standing in the crowd on Hong Kong’s waterfront in torrential rain. A sad bugle played as the flag was lowered, and the royal yacht Britannia carried the Prince of Wales out to sea – and Britain out of its last Asian colony. We all had one thought. Thank goodness that’s over. Hong Kong’s last governor, Chris Patten, left what China clearly saw as a mess on the carpet, an elected assembly under the slogan “one country, two systems”. No one expected it to last, but Britain left with a certain dignity.So why did Britain’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, take it on himself this week to revisit the scene? He applauded Hong Kong’s recent demonstrations and warned Beijing not to crack down on the rioters. He said the Chinese regime should not use a few broken windows as “a pretext for repression”. Britain would not stand for it. He said there would be “serious consequences”.As was glaringly obvious, Hunt’s remarks had nothing to do with Hong Kong. He was puffing up his chest and signalling virtue in his contest for Downing Street with Boris Johnson. He wanted to show himself a player who could talk big on the world stage, who could move mountains. Johnson, he implied, could only move a few London cycle lanes.China’s ambassador in London, Liu Xiaoming, might well have let this childishness pass, but he could not resist a crushing rejoinder. He said the issue was not the freedom of Hong Kong’s citizens to protest, which has been much tolerated over recent weeks. The issue was violence and vandalism against a democratic assembly. That was a crime. London should understand that, under Britain’s much-vaunted legacy, Hong Kong’s elected government and judiciary were responsible for crime, not Beijing.Liu pointed out that Hong Kong had enjoyed more democratic self-government under the shadow of Beijing than it had in a century and a half of British rule. Under Britain “there was no freedom, no democracy whatever” nor the right “to have an independent judicial power”. Hunt’s “gross and unacceptable” remarks offended the guiding principles of “mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs”, long espoused by both countries. A spokesman in Beijing went further. Britain was hypocritical. He implied that it should sort out Brexit and leave Hong Kong to mend its own windows. The Foreign Office summoned the ambassador and told him not to be so rude – or once again there would be “serious consequences”.The 1984 and 1994 bilateral accords on Hong Kong’s future were diplomatic triumphs of post-colonial history. Compromises were reached between diametrically opposed positions. China conceded the colony half a century of democracy to 2047, largely in return for a quiet life and a useful business outlet. As a result, a partial autonomy survived in the territory even during periods of repression elsewhere in China.Anyone who now visits Hong Kong is aware of the fragility of this settlement. The presence on Chinese soil of a measure of alien democracy and human rights hangs by a thread. Recent street protests against the brutal extradition law were impressive and, so far, successful. The weekend’s descent into violence was trivial but, to a hypersensitive Beijing, alarming. The demonstrators provocative unfurling of the old British flag played into the hands of the Chinese hard-liners.The reality has always been that the 1984 deal depended on Beijing sticking to it and that in turn will depend on how far the activists in Hong Kong push their luck. Beijing has already toppled three Hong Kong chief executives, and dares not lose effective control. The one certainty is that what happens between now and 2047 will be the outcome of a resolution of forces within China’s shifting elites, and nowhere else.It is therefore hard to imagine a more blundering, cliched and counterproductive intervention than Hunt’s. The idea that Beijing would shift its policy one inch because someone halfway round the world was frantic to advance his career is farcical. As for Britain offering any practical aid or comfort to the street protesters, that is preposterous if not a cruel deception. What does Hunt mean by serious consequences? Will he send an aircraft carrier?The ritual of British ministers “raising human rights issues” with Beijing has long been a charade. The post-2008, pre-2012 Olympics talks – with London begging advice while criticising human rights abuses – was embarrassing to all concerned. The same went for David Cameron and George Osborne’s bizarre “kowtow diplomacy” in 2015, seeking funds for such vanity projects as Hinkley Point, HS2 and the “northern powerhouse”. It just gave China leverage over chunks of British infrastructure.Hunt is currently championing hard Brexit on the basis that vast riches lie in bilateral deals “with the rest of the world”. If so, is he really going to embargo Chinese trade as a consequence of Hong Kong? He should watch out that Beijing does not return the compliment.As Hunt walks to his Foreign Office chamber, he passes majestic paintings and sculptures celebrating the wonders that British imperial rule brought to the four corners of the Earth. It is tempting for his head to be turned by the voluptuous symbols of British power projection. It has clearly happened. Damn it, say the pictures, we used to rule the world.Like Tony Blair, Hunt aches to blunder about the world declaring all its evils “unacceptable” and arguing “something must be done” about them. He wants his office to “punch above its weight”. Hong Kong is not his country and not his business. Britain handed it back to China two decades ago, surrendering sovereignty over it to an immeasurably greater power. Yet for people like Hunt it seems the imperial urge will never ease."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62701b65c112c74ba5b53ac39c39c8d558275837/0_144_4410_2646/master/4410.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9974190bd0458ebde4cff01878f2c6a","title":"the guardian view on theresa may she should have thought about the uk all along","story":"Theresa May’s speech in Stirling on Thursday spoke volumes. It was not the content that was especially striking, although there was much there that was interesting, including a review under Lord Dunlop of the role of Whitehall departments in the devolved nations. But the fact and timing of the speech signified more. Mrs May is playing out time in Downing Street. For her to devote one of her last visits to the public pulpit as prime minister to the importance of the UK union is a significant choice. It tells us that she is scared the union will not survive under her successor.Mrs May’s message was that whoever takes over from her will have among their “first and greatest duties” the need to strengthen the union. This will come as something of a surprise to May watchers. Her three years at the helm have not been marked by sustained sensitivity to the union, by fresh initiatives or by persuasive evidence that she has any great feeling for it. On the contrary, she has been a centraliser, and the Dunlop review – which she says both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt support – appears designed to claim a bigger role, involving greater spending for Whitehall over Scotland and Wales.The lack of engagement has been disabling, both in Northern Ireland and Scotland. In the former, Mrs May presided over a continuing period of political stagnation. For the majority of her premiership, devolved institutions have been in abeyance. There has been no sense that she sees restoring them as a priority. Quite the reverse. Her pact with the DUP has implied that their view of the union and Brexit is also hers. Her speech in Belfast last year was a low point of her premiership.With Scotland, Mrs May has been equally cautious. She made an early visit to Edinburgh in 2016, but she has done nothing sustained to reach out to Scottish concerns. Though her speech blamed the SNP for refusing to cooperate, she seemed to decide early on that there was nothing to be gained by working with a resourceful and implacable foe on Brexit. The upshot was not just that Mrs May appeared unresponsive but also that she was unresponsive. As a result, the SNP dominates Scotland’s Brexit debate and is back in the driving seat on independence too.All of this comes back to Brexit. Northern Ireland and Scotland are the two component parts of the UK that voted to remain in the EU. In both, hostility to Brexit has increased since 2016. They are also the two, unlike Wales, in which the union is under most immediate stress. The connection is umbilical. Mrs May tried to deliver a Brexit that Northern Ireland and Scotland do not want, did it incompetently, in an increasingly extreme form, and without addressing Irish or Scottish concerns honestly, or at all.The result is that Brexit is disabling the Tory party in Scotland and threatening to undermine the cohesion and viability of the British state. Few now think that the Scottish Tories will improve on their 2016 and 2017 electoral successes large losses are more likely. An early general election could give the SNP a mandate to demand a second referendum. The narrowing of the polls suggests that this time Scotland might secede. The impact on the UK would be lasting in every way. The future in it of Northern Ireland and even Wales would come into question. The thought has UK military chiefs in mounting panic.The prospect of Mr Johnson as Mrs May’s successor means that Christmas may come early for the SNP. Mr Johnson embodies a thoughtless, arrogant and disrespectful Englishness that offers rich pickings. It is hard to see any way that he can now avoid becoming the SNP’s recruiting sergeant. But this is not ultimately about personalities. This would not all go away if Mr Hunt prevails. This is about Brexit. And it is about the way that an asymmetric union of four very different nations has failed to ensure enough mutual respect.Just as she prepares to depart, Mrs May has uttered an anguished plea to think about the union. So she should. But her last-minute anxiety is pretty rich. She should have addressed this from the start, not at the end. The damage has been done on her watch, and as a result of her approach. It may well be true that her successor will do even more damage. But Mrs May’s own role in this disaster cannot be ignored."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce9c0d6221b23a8e03a60a07224f28ef4425c0b9/0_0_941_580/master/941.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4768941bd645db9466e79dc14496b29c 645w","title":"british museum launches guided tours of lgbtq treasures","story":"Tours will take in objects such as Warren Cup, seen as holy grail of gay historyAn 11,000-year-old carving of a couple making love, a gender-fluid depiction of a Babylonian deity dating from 1800BC and busts of the Roman emperor Hadrian and his lover Antinous will feature in new LGBTQ-themed guided tours at the British Museum.Around a dozen volunteers will take visitors to see objects also including an Athenian wine amphora with racy images of men getting intimate, and the museum’s most famous gay object, the Warren Cup, a Roman drinking vessel seen as the holy grail of gay history.The initiative builds on LGBTQ audio tours at the museum. “We’ll see how they go, see what the demand is,” said Sarah Saunders, the head of learning and national programmes at the museum. “The more demand there is, the more we’ll do … it is really exciting.”What the objects on the tour all demonstrated, she said, was “that same-sex love and desire and gender ersity have always been an integral part of human experience, but that the way they have been expressed has varied widely around the world and over time.”The oldest object on the tour is the Ain Sakhri Lovers, an 11,000-year-old calcite pebble found in a cave in the Judean desert and made by hunter-gatherers known as Natufians. It is the world’s oldest known depiction of a couple having sex. The genders are unclear and open to interpretation.Considerably more recent, although still 200 years old, are chocolate cups and saucers that belonged to Lady Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, two Irish aristocrats who eloped to Wales in 1778 and are known as the Ladies of Llangollen.The Warren Cup shows two scenes of men making love. It survived because it was buried somewhere near Bethlehem in the 1st century AD, It resurfaced in the 19th century and entered the collection of a rich gay collector, Ned Warren. The museum purchased it in 1999 for £1.8m.Eight solid silver cups cast in the shape of the Warren Cup were unveiled in the museum’s Enlightenment gallery on Thursday. The “Pride cups”, each tinted to represent a different colour of the original Pride rainbow flag, were made by Hal Messel, a silversmith, and will be sold to raise funds for the campaigning charity Stonewall and for the museum’s work with the LGBTQ community.Messel said the project was about “tackling assumptions and raising awareness around how gender identity and sexual orientation continue to remain on the fringes of so much contemporary art.”He said it was interesting to note that the Warren Cup was considered more provocative by some today than it was by the Romans 2,000 years ago.Stonewall’s chief executive, Ruth Hunt, said: “For something as establishment as the British Museum to get behind this is is incredibly powerful. This project has helped spark an important conversation about how attitudes have changed and how much work there is still left to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b80a02d3310b9051cb0f4eeeceee24a15668d96/0_46_4150_2490/master/4150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=075845d12c29f11d23ca6cae9b442462","title":"david lynch gives manchester gallery 100 prints to boost funding","story":"HOME gallery in Manchester hopes to raise £42,500 by selling the limited-edition printsThe film-maker David Lynch has charged no fee to the Manchester gallery hosting the biggest ever UK exhibition of his visual art and given them 100 limited-edition prints to sell to fund future projects.HOME in Manchester hopes to raise £42,500 by selling the prints for £425 each – a quarter of the price the Blue Velvet director usually charges. Called “Four (4) Heads Came Out on Wednesday”, the monochrome, signed print was only available in person at the box office on Thursday, with all but seven snapped up at the time of publishing.The gallery describes the picture as showing a “figurative apparition with multiple floating, circling heads, wailing upon a lonely hillside, a house of home in the rear-ground, earth and sky mingling in a brewing storm of Lynchian menace”.Lynch, plus his collectors, have lent 88 artworks to HOME for a free show called My Head Is Disconnected, one of the highlights of this year’s Manchester International Festival (MIF).The weather forecast is bright for the 17-day culture fest, but Lynch’s contribution is predictably dark: amorphous figures spewing tarry ectoplasm saying: “Oh, I said a BAD thing”, a little boy apparently burning down the house of his childhood crush and the corruption of an innocent figure called Bob, who seems a lot friendlier than his sinister Twin Peaks namesake.“I find it very difficult to understand what is going on these days,” cries one wretched figure, bent over double, apparently on fire as they crawl along the blackened ground. Lynch painted the picture in 2009 but it feels more relevant than ever in an era of alternative facts, fake news and experts fatigue.The show also features specially curated music events, talks and a Lynch film retrospective. The director will appear via videolink for a sold-out discussion this Saturday.Bren O’Callaghan, HOME’s curator, travelled to Lynch’s Hollywood compound last month to finalise the show and said Lynch had been “wonderful” to deal with: “He has been very, very generous with us.” The money raised from the prints would be “incredibly” helpful to HOME, he added.Just don’t expect any commentary from the artist to explain his often macabre images. “A common question people ask of David is: what is going on in your head? He would like to turn that on its head and ask what’s going on in your head?” said O’Callaghan. “He wants you to be a detective and work out for yourself what the art is about: he says the clues are all there.”The festival opened on Thursday evening with a mass bell-ringing session, orchestrated from afar by Yoko Ono. Bells for Peace involves 4,000 ceramic bells, handmade and engraved for the occasion, ringing out across Manchester’s Cathedral Gardens, along with the bongs of a huge Buddhist bell and antique church bells. Like Lynch, Ono did not travel to Manchester to take part but conceived the project, which invited members of the public to bring their own bells too.Also premiering on Thursday night was Tree, a musical based on Mi Mandela, an album by actor and DJ Idris Elba.Previews of the show have been overshadowed by claims from two female writers, who alleged they had been frozen out of the production after developing it for four years.On Thursday Sarah Henley and Tori Allen-Martin announced that they had raised £12,800 in two days since going public with their grievance involving Elba and director Kwame Kwei-Armah, who are billed as the co-creators of Tree in the MIF programme.The women started a crowdfunder after their claims went viral, in which they said they had been “bullied and silenced” and had to instruct lawyers to try (and fail) to get a credit on the production.They said £5,000 would pay their legal bill and the rest would go towards the foundation of Burn Bright, a resource they hope will help female writers in the industry “with as little red tape around it as possible”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f05f342b4f6535c202792c951bbca747644fa77/117_163_1252_751/master/1252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e22ea3ab2120599841d06aabd8e2e0cb","title":"the end of satire mad magazine to cease regular publication","story":"Comedian Al Yankovic laments loss of ‘one of the all-time greatest American institutions’Mad magazine, a US institution famous for the grinning face of jug-eared, tiny-eyed mascot Alfred E Neuman, is to stop being a regular fixture of newsstands.The satirical magazine will no longer be published monthly with new material from the autumn, its owners DC Comics said. Instead there will be end-of-year specials and magazines with classic and best-of content which will be sold in comic shops and direct to subscribers.While Mad magazine is not disappearing, it is not going to be the force it once was.The comedian and musical parodist Al Yankovic, a former guest editor, was one of many to take to social media lamenting the decision. He said he was “profoundly sad … I can’t begin to describe the impact it had on me as a young kid – it’s pretty much the reason I turned out weird. Goodbye to one of the all-time greatest American institutions.”The comic book artist Bill Sienkiewicz tweeted: “I hope people understand what this means to us as a nation, both as a culture and as a functioning critical society.“MAD wasn’t JUST a humor magazine. It’s not just the end of an era it’s the end of…”Actor and musician Steven Van Zandt tweeted a Mad cover poking fun of the Sopranos cast, of which, as Silvio Dante, he was part. “Making the cover of Rolling Stone was nice, but I didn’t feel meaningful until I made the cover of Mad Magazine!’”Mad magazine was founded in 1952 as a comic book, the first issue written almost entirely by its editor Harvey Kurtzman. It became a magazine in 1955 and soon began building up influence and readership with its sharp satire and cheerful daftness.Its readership peaked at more than 2 million in 1974 but in recent years it was widely acknowledged not to be the force it once was.When Donald Trump compared the Democrat 2020 nomination hopeful Pete Buttigieg to gap-toothed, freckled Neuman, catchphrase “What, me worry?”, it went over the younger politician’s head.Buttigieg confessed: “I’ll be honest. I had to Google that. I guess it’s just a generational thing. I didn’t get the reference.“It’s kind of funny, I guess. But he’s also the president of the United States and I’m surprised he’s not spending more time trying to salvage this China deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79e5000fa4d9a632fc13ed249c7fb7f0d6256bc/0_92_3976_2385/master/3976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=583cc22369c6dc033bb20f513f92d3ef","title":"figures reveal english schools cant afford to teach five days a week","story":"Labour MP Jess Phillips, whose son is affected, is leading a march in Westminster on FridayMore than 200 schools in England are cutting short the school week, or are actively consulting on it, because they cannot afford to educate their pupils for a full five days, according to campaigners.The figure was revealed on the eve of a demonstration in Westminster by parents and pupils protesting about a crisis in education funding, which means a growing number of children are being sent home at lunchtime every Friday so schools can save money.Organised by Labour MP Jess Phillips, whose son’s Birmingham primary is among those affected, the march on Friday afternoon will be attended by protesters from Birmingham, Brighton, Hove, Hitchin, Wiltshire, Stockport, Hastings and Leicester.To drive home the point, the Birmingham Yardley MP will deposit her 10-year-old son Danny and his best friend Morris on the front step of 10 Downing Street, where they will do their schoolwork, as a reminder of the government’s responsibility to care for and educate the nation’s children on a Friday afternoon.“The whole thing is quite exciting for him,” said Phillips. “He wants to stick up for his school. It’s a brilliant school.”According to Phillips, 26 schools in Birmingham including her son’s, Kings Heath primary, are either already on a four and a half-day week or are about to introduce it. Not only are pupils losing out on vital hours in school, parents are left scrambling to rearrange work or find childcare and school staff are losing jobs or pay.Phillips said it was the responsibility of the government to make sure that every child is in school five days a week. “There are certain fundamentals in public sector services. Our children get free education five days a week. If you break your leg you can have a cast put on it. There are these fundamental principles that we expect from the state. Currently the state cannot deliver it.”The campaign group Save our Schools (SOS) says children on four and a half-day weeks will lose 20 days of education over the course of a school year. They also point out the “hypocrisy” of government policies which leave schools with little choice but to close early, when parents face heavy fines for taking their child out of school for unauthorised absences.“Every day, children are taught in crumbling buildings subjects such as art and music are disappearing from the curriculum pupils with special education needs are losing vital support and dedicated teaching staff are losing their jobs,” said SOS campaigner Kate Taylor.“Now schools are being forced to reduce the length of the school week. Parents, teachers and pupils are living with the effects of a government that is not interested in investing in their education.“If we were to remove our children for one Friday afternoon, let alone every Friday afternoon, we would be committing a criminal offence. It’s quite simple: we want our children to be in school receiving the education they deserve.”Asked for comment on the protest, the DfE said flexibility over the length of the school week is not new and that schools have long had the choice to structure the school week as they choose. The department also pointed out that Birmingham’s funding was above average and should cover a full week of schooling for each child.A spokesperson said: “The funding for an average primary class of 28 in Birmingham is £125,000 – above the national average of £115,000 for an equivalent-sized class. These amounts are to cover a full five-day week in term time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a65ab1aecb4921457f3db7f7fad29dc0f2d73dd/209_531_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa11d7e78ea045b82e7291ea4af1b48b","title":"share photos of wildflower and planted meadows and verges near you","story":"If you have seen any planted meadows or verges by roads or public spaces, we would like to hear from youBritish conservation charity Plantlife’s campaign to encourage the growth and planting of flowers on UK roadside verges has seen some councils take the message seriously.Posting on Twitter, Bex Langley wrote about the eight miles of flowers planted along a major road in Rotherham thanks to the local council.The group’s road verge campaign started in 2013 in response to the mowing down of wildflowers – flowers which are not intentionally seeded or planted.

As with any clothes, they are a way of presenting ourselves to the world. And for some, that means wearing top hats, breeches, doublets, or Bakelite jewellery. Below, six period dressers explain their choices:These are everyday clothes of the early 19th century. I never leave the house without a hat and I tend to walk around with a cane, too. A lot of what I wear at the moment is Regency style.I’ve been dressing alternatively since I was 14 because modern fashion has never appealed to me. I wanted to look back to a time when things were of a higher quality and wear clothes that would make me stand out. I began wearing late-Victorian and Edwardian stuff bought in vintage shops in Brighton and it made me genuinely happy. I got into the Regency look because I was invited to a Regency ball in London and had nothing to wear. I tried to make something myself, but realised it was terrible since I couldn’t find the right fabrics, so I decided to research the history and develop my own skills.The Regency period was the last hurrah of men’s fun with fashion, when people could be loud with colour and exuberant. The jackets, cravats, trousers – all of it is just wonderful to wear. It’s comfortable, too, and since I make it all myself, it makes me proud to have it on. It’s also a great ice-breaker.My clothes take time and it’s all about learning to be slow, rather than buying into fast fashion, which is unethical and so removed from the production process. You are who you are and you have to get on with it I feel very much at home in what I wear and how I wear it.I haven’t really had any backlash – people have been very inquisitive and polite to me. I don’t see jeans in my future. If anything, I see something more extreme.My style is 1940s and 50s inspired. When I was in my early 20s, I was living in Australia and I started going to secondhand shops because I didn’t have much money. I realised I could buy all the princess dresses that I loved as a little girl cheaply so I started with 1980s clothes and then worked my way back, before settling on the 40s as my style. It’s more comfortable for me and it’s very girly when I cut my hair short, I didn’t want to look boyish, so these clothes are lovely and feminine.When I dress, it makes me feel like myself. I’m in awe of people who look good in just a white T-shirt and jeans, but this style gives me that comfort. Dressing up brings so much joy into my life: sometimes, when I’m sad, I just want to wear colourful clothes because they cheer me up and make me want to go out.In my experience, it’s rare to see people of colour in the vintage scene. I think it might be because we’re already minorities, so we don’t want to draw more attention to ourselves by virtue of the clothes we’re wearing. I grew up with being westernised as the goal, and vintage clothing from my culture highlights the fact that I’m different and, in the current political climate, perhaps sometimes we don’t want to be different.The most important thing is that people wear clothes that are more sustainable and that they use them. Vintage clothes are made to last and it’s made me learn to sew because I have to take care of these clothes – they have survived 80 years and they can’t die in my care.My style is rooted in the 1930s. I always wear trousers with braces, made from a natural material such as cotton or linen, a collarless shirt, a bakerboy cap and leather shoes. I started off doing it because I’m a carpenter and I got a back injury about eight years ago, so there was a practical side to wearing high-waisted trousers with braces that took the pressure off my back and I really liked pairing them with the 30s style.The way I dress led me into 30s culture. I started playing jazz saxophone and got into the dancing of the period, where the clothes really take on a new purpose. It’s nice for iniduals to express themselves in life. I’m not trying to be anything I’m not, I just feel good dressing like this, and it gives other people a sense of who I am. It’s all positive.I’ve always been interested in clothes even when I was at school I had my own sewing machine and I would adapt clothes or paint them. People would give me a hard time because I was an eccentric, but I was determined to be the way I was and now, as an adult, it doesn’t bother me. People don’t have anything to say.Dressing this way is the future – buying fewer clothes and adapting them. We need to value craft and pay someone for doing their job.I dress in 17th-century clothes from the civil war period. I reenact the war and I like the clothes, so I wear them every day. A typical outfit would be a shirt, breeches, doublet, shoes and a hat. I make a lot of my clothes myself and some I buy from traders at re-enactment events. I read books on the patterns of the period and the methods of manufacture and do what I can.Towards the end of the 90s, I was working at a historical property in Wolverhampton and a mate of mine joined a civil war re-enactment society. He persuaded me to come along. Initially, I would only wear the clothes at the re-enactments, but then they started to seep into my everyday wardrobe and, since 2005, I’ve been wearing them all the time. They’re comfortable and I like the style, so I wear it. It means I don’t have to worry about today’s trends. They do for me what any clothes do: provide warmth and avoid nakedness.I’m self-employed as a guide to a National Trust property, which is in a 1930s modernist style, and some people can be a little thrown to have me there in 17th-century clothing to show them around. But most seem not to bother.I don’t tend to get much backlash some people might shout on the street that I look like Robin Hood, but they need to learn their history Robin Hood was dead by 1200 and these clothes were current by 1640. Generally, people just say it looks like fun.I wear clothes from the 1940s and 50s a typical outfit would be a pair of 30s-style culottes with a little blouse, a 40s sweater and wide-legged pants, or a 50s Gypsy skirt. I’ve been into it since I was 14 years old: that was in the 80s when there were a lot of subcultures happening, from mods to punks. I used to look at the mod girls at school and thought they were fantastic – I wanted to be part of the crew. I started out with 60s clothes and moved back to the 50s as a young adult and have settled on it ever since.I just think it’s so much more glamorous and classy – it makes me feel more special when I wear it, because modern clothing can look so tacky and bland. The clothing I wear is much more colourful and vibrant and I’ve always lived with furniture and decorations from that period, too – it’s become my whole lifestyle. We’ve redecorated our house to replicate the 50s style. I couldn’t live in a grey, modern design, I’d be so depressed. Living in the midst of all this colourful mid-20th-century design gives me so much pleasure. This is what I live in and what I wear because it makes me feel good. People say it makes me look younger, too!I collect clothes from the 1930s to the 50s. An everyday outfit would probably be a vintage picture- or border-print skirt with a Gypsy top and Bakelite jewellery.My dad’s an actor and he was really into old movies, so when I was young, we would watch all the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals together on a Sunday. I always wanted to be Ginger Rogers and I always wanted to dance. When I was in my 20s, I discovered a place in central London where you can go lindy hop or jive dancing and, through going there, I met people who dressed this way and knew the places to get the original clothes. I could finally be Ginger Rogers.That was in about 1996 and I’ve been dressing this way ever since. I wish I’d known it existed before that because I definitely would have started earlier.I love this era of clothes – it’s colourful and you feel so good when you dance in it, especially with men in wide-legged trousers. It’s a far more glamorous era than the one we live in now things can feel so scruffy with just T-shirts and jeans around. Wearing those clothes makes me feel as if I’m inhabiting a different time and they’re such exciting, unique pieces to own.It is important to buy clothes that suit you and your shape, which also bring something distinctive to your day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67a7c6a9ce4944f4f30d1d0ae56ced0ff1a2d3b/0_348_7157_4295/master/7157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7eecd4cbc1dbb52498ea8fce2dffb7","title":"garlic pineapple pomegranates the definitive guide to peeling 11 of the trickiest foods","story":"Why shell a boiled egg when you can squeeze it out, or use your fingernails on an orange when a knife is quicker? Here’s how to make life in the kitchen much easierWhen the Toronto foodie Valentina Bachkarova-Lord recently posted a video of her favourite way to peel a head of garlic, Twitter went crazy. “ALL THIS TIME??” was the viral reaction, as in: “We’ve been doing it wrong all this time?” Just months before, there was a similar furore over a pineapple-peeling hack in which two manicured hands literally pulled apart a pineapple no slicing or dicing, no juice, no mess. It would appear that – right up there with grumpy cats and happy dogs – peeling produce “the right way” is a surefire means of grabbing the world’s attention.The garlic and pineapple videos have now racked up tens of millions of views (23.8m and 13.4m, respectively). Of course, it is entirely possible that this owes less to culinary curiosity than to our phone addiction. As the New Yorker’s Helen Rosner put it, the videos hit “all the same tension-and-release dopamine levers as (uggghhh) pimple-popping videos”. But that didn’t stop her from stubbornly trying – and failing – to peel a bulb the way the woman in the garlic video did. In fact, it landed her in the emergency room, getting five stitches in her middle finger. So, perhaps Bachkarova-Lord’s method isn’t the right way?Beyond garlic and pineapple, there are hacks for peeling avocados, eggs, ginger, mangoes, onions, oranges, pistachios, pomegranates and potatoes. (Also kiwis: the peeling trick being that you don’t need to peel a kiwi, just eat it whole, like an apple. Bonkers.) But do they actually work? I put 11 to the test.Add a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to your boiling water (to increase the alkalinity and make the egg easier to peel). When cooked, run the egg under cold water until just cool enough to handle, then crack at either end to make holes. Now you have two options: if you’re up for a challenge, hold the big end up to your mouth with one hand, and blow hard to catch the egg with your other hand as it flies out of the small end. Or else, squeeze lightly until it plops out. Both work.Instead of shredding your fingertips and breaking your nails trying to pull open nuts that have barely split, use an empty pistachio shell. It is thin enough to slide into any gap, however slim, and hard enough for you to be able to lever it and prise the closed nut open. A revelation.Many a food blogger’s favourite hack: you use the edge of a teaspoon to just scrape the skin off. The spoon gets into all the folds and creases a knife just can’t deal with, meaning you can use the whole root, knobbly bits included. And it is so easy.Not a hack so much as proper chef’s training. Slice the bulb vertically straight down the middle, through the root. Peel the papery outer layers off one half, then lay it flat-side down on your board and, holding firmly by the root, slice from the pointy end to just above the root, keeping the latter intact. Slice again at right angles to these cuts to obtain a pile of perfectly diced onion.The viral video shows someone pulling the fruit apart, segment by easy segment, like you might a cinnamon bun traybake. However, as countless failed attempts to replicate it prove, this only works if you have what’s called a “snack pineapple”, and not the whoppers from Costa Rica sold at Sainsburys and my local street market. Even rolling one of these firmly across your work surface a couple times to loosen the fibres, and scoring it in places before attempting to pull it apart, only results in all the juice on the floor and a mound of unappetising fibres. Nah. Use a knife.Slice in half, then whack the stone head-on with the sharp edge of a big knife and twist and pull the knife out to remove the stone. Then run a dessert spoon between the flesh and skin of each half, to remove intact before slicing thinly. Smoothly does it. Just be careful you don’t end up in hospital.Score a raw spud around its waist in a very light, continuous line, then boil until tender. Once cooked, you’ll see the peel pulling back from the cut, ready for you to slide off in a single movement.By far the most aesthetically pleasing of these culinary hacks. Cut around the calyx – that spiky protrusion on one end – until you can pull it out. You should now see the seeds grouped into segments ided by white membranes. Score the skin of the pomegranate on the outside, from top to bottom, following those membranes. The fruit will then fall open like a flower.The Bachkarova-Lord way – which involves holding a bulb root-side-up, sticking a paring knife into clove after clove and, with a small amount of pressure, twisting them out of their papery sheaths – doesn’t work for me, until I find the YouTube channel Glen \u0026amp Friends Cooking’s explanation. The trick is to first score the unpeeled head, all around the base of the cloves, where they meet the root. Once you have done that, twisting them out, one by one, with your knife is a doddle. But it is only worth doing if you need a heck of a lot of garlic. For a clove or two, pressing with the flat of your knife is perfectly acceptable.Another revelation. Stand your fruit on its end and rotate it so you can slice straight down on either side of the pip to remove it. Hold one of the halves, skin side down, in your palm and work a glass between the flesh and skin from one end all the way to the other. You end up with a satisfyingly solid piece of mango in your glass and a pip you can still suck on, because – let’s face it – that is part of the fun.Slice off both ends of your orange, then set it on one flat end and cut it vertically, from top to bottom into the centre.

I’ll paraphrase wildly, adding injunctions of my own, since so much of Bond’s alcohol preference is related to his masculinity. Worrying about the size of your dick while you’re deciding on cocktails is the surest way to end up drunk.So, it’s summer: nothing too strong because you’ll be dehydrated nothing too wussy or fruity because they go down too easily nothing too boring because this will likely be your main taste experience of the evening nothing too unnatural in colour, because these are always too sweet and no Pimm’s, for reasons. Bond settles on an Americano: Campari, sweet vermouth and club soda. In that bitters market, I would prefer a Campari and soda: cleaner and fresher without vermouth, and with zero chance that someone will accidentally fetch you a cup of coffee. Let me quickly take down Pimm’s: the problem is not merely that it doesn’t taste like alcohol. It tastes so unlike alcohol that it edges towards the most childish zone of the soft drinks arena, and if you are happy to drink cream soda with bits in all evening, why not do that? Proving, perhaps, that a lot of drunkenness depends on taste, you don’t even feel drunk while you’re drinking it. The first you get to hear about its alcohol content is when you fall over.Sangria is fine to make, but never drink a stranger’s as you never know what you’ll be getting. My Mr makes it with two bottles of red wine, one of rosé, a glass of brandy, two litres of Fanta and frozen berries, producing a solid session drink that I would never argue with. My excellent friend, meanwhile, makes it with all those things, except instead of Fanta, honey. Not two litres of honey, two spoons. This is the opposite of a session drink it’s more like spiking yourself. Yet it tastes exactly like regular sangria, so it’s like spiking yourself invisibly.At the Diageo summer party in Westminster last week – as a globalised drinks company, it ought to know its spirits – there was a negroni fountain. Mishearing that as “Peroni fountain” and expecting something the colour of a very light beer, I went and stuck my glass in the actual fountain, made of water. But that is a perfectly fine misunderstanding. Negronis are, give or take the odd bit of zest and bitters, entirely composed of mostly very strong alcohol, which is the worst thing you can do to yourself, because they are delicious. My dad was a booze oracle: the first job I had was editing a doomed freesheet for students in Earl’s Court, and I gave him a column called the Old Imbiber. All around the pubs of a very small pocket of west London, the bar staff used to go: “I know you, you’re that old imbiber!”, and someone once took a picture of him with his mouth against an optic, which – in the days before cameraphones – was a huge deal, like being Madonna.His wisdom was slightly sullied by the fact that he would drink absolutely anything, and once when he had a cough, he made a cocktail of grappa and Benylin. So I am not saying listen to him on everything, but he had a particular fondness for the whiskey base, which brings us to the mint julep. This is the definitive summer cocktail: terrifically delicious, great pedigree. Signature drink of the Kentucky Derby, where it is always hot and they know a thing or two about drinking for two days straight, it is simple to the point of purity: bourbon, five sprigs of mint, a slug of sugar syrup, heaps of ice. With a glass full of crushed ice, the drink evolves with your conversation, getting weaker as it goes. It’s a sipper but a charmer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcb52b9c2a7be240357744e76e2646cde0940220/0_360_3572_2144/master/3572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ef64bbb11130df35d3120e8fd10b0b2","title":"womens world cup means so much england usa readers","story":"The tournament has not just broken TV records. It has also changed how people see the sportIt’s changed my (male) partner’s view of women’s football. He didn’t know much about it before and assumed the women’s game must be somehow “less exciting” because it’s not as popular, but he’s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me – even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!He’s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women’s football should be put on level standing with the men’s game. He’s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women’s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I’m so proud of him! I’m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn’t play football because it was a ‘boys sport’. Jen, South YorkshireWe usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men’s team, but this is the first time we’ve watched a women’s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I’ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I’ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, LondonThe tournament has changed my perception of the women’s game completely. Prior to the tournament I’d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.We travelled to Nice to watch England’s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer’s World Cup. I’m already making plans to attend some Women’s Super League games next season – something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women’s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I’m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, LondonThe tournament hasn’t been a massive change for me. I’ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I’ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They’ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men’s game). I’m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, MinneapolisWatching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women’s football. The game is better than the men’s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I’ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women’s games. They’ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it’ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I’m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, GlossopThis World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women’s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women’s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I’m hooked.It’s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do – it’s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they’re all so engaging?For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is – the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-BowlandI’ve always loved the Women’s World Cup. This year, however, there’s something more in it for me as it feels like the most erse tournament I’ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn’t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered “soccer” – thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s – I was in love and convinced I’d found my sport.But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it’s something I’ll regret for the rest of my life.I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable.There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I’ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years. But in that time I’ve also witnessed my country celebrate our women’s national team with genuine fervour and respect.This tournament has given us the chance to see women become national heroes and to be taken seriously not for their appearance, but for their grit and talent. Regardless of who wins, I think it’s been a tremendous success for the women’s game and a great moment in the march towards gender parity.

To achieve this we will be working tirelessly with the clubs in the FA Women’s Super League to create a vision for the women’s game that is mutually supportive and will be the envy of the world.”That was the Football Association’s head of women’s football, Sue Campbell. She was not speaking after England’s defeat by the USA in Lyon but two years ago, at Wembley. In March 2017 the FA launched its flagship Gameplan for Growth for the women’s game. It was a turning point, with the chief executive Martin Glenn opening by apologising on behalf of the FA for the 50-year ban that excluded women’s teams from association-affiliated grounds.The plan had three key targets from 2017 to 2020: to double participation, double attendances and show consistent success on a world stage. That third ambition was broken into two parts: to be “within the top three countries across all age groups” and have the “potential to win the 2023 Fifa World Cup”.This was before Phil Neville before the Barclays Women’s Super League sponsorship before the restructure and professional top tier. If two years is a long time in football, it is even longer in women’s football.So although the defeat in France is still raw, it is important to reflect on the journey that started in 2017. No one goes to a World Cup not wanting to win but this year’s tournament was never the gold goal set out by the FA it was considered too soon. That the Lionesses, while being outplayed, lost the semi-final by the finest of margins is a testament to how rapidly things have changed.You could argue that Neville’s tactics were wrong, that he shuffled his pack a little too much, that switching the penalty-taker was a mistake, that breaking up the Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris right-wing tag team was an error, that Millie Bright is not equipped to pass out from the back, and that he perhaps naively tried to out-tactic the masters of game management. But ultimately England were outclassed and it is hard to see how any of the alternate starting XIs would have dealt with the speed and skill of the USA players in transition to much greater effect.You could also argue that the difference was mentality. The USA are winners. They even have a chant for it – the clumsy “we believe that we will win” rings out at every match.However, the context to this discussion is deeper than all that. Underpinning the US women’s national team is a domestic game and education system that give them a talent pool and competitive winning environment that other nations can only dream of.The new Fifa Women’s Football Survey shows there are 120,557 female players registered in England (76,625 under-18). In the US, though, there are 1.6 million formally registered players and it is estimated that 9.5 million girls and women play organised football (with those in the National Collegiate Athletic Association andor high school system not necessarily formally registered with US Soccer).As an aside, of teams that made the World Cup’s last eight, seven were from the nine countries listed as having more than 100,000 registered players (only Canada and Australia did not make the quarter-finals from that list, while Italy bucked the trend).Where we have girls forced to play in boys’ teams, or to travel miles to join girls’ teams, and a lower competitive level because there are so few players, the US has girls training and playing competitively from childhood through to the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL). Though the WSL may be catching up and possibly overtaking it, the deep foundations underpinning the sport keep the Americans miles ahead.They know it. That is not arrogance, it is pride. Pride in a system that has delivered.Campbell summed it up after England were beaten by the USA. “These women came through their schools with soccer,” she said. “In some schools in America they get soccer every day of the week. In some of our schools we’re lucky if they get a few hours a week. You can’t start suddenly developing this three-quarters of the way through their development. You have to start at the foundation stage. Until we get the foundations right we are going to be playing catch-up.”There is plenty not to like about women’s football in America. It is very much a white middle-class sport, you have to pay to play outside school, excluding those from the most vulnerable backgrounds, but the principles of Title IX and the college system should be celebrated and protected.In England growth is small but significant. There was an increase in registered teams of 1,774 in the 12 months to March 2019, to 11,088. Last year the Under-20s won a World Cup bronze. The senior side have reached two more major semi-finals since the Gameplan for Growth was launched. There is a promise to give every girl the chance to play football in school."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a129964adb5fc0e2bd5e2f175e1ee407828807ad/0_252_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=074e3bc1545fc45f5b08ecacebd3d5b3","title":"bullish frank lampard lifts chelsea mood no favours","story":"The buzzword was realism, a theme maintained whether Frank Lampard was raising the new Chelsea shirt to the pop of the flashbulbs in a cluttered suite high in Stamford Bridge’s west stand, or had retired to the directors’ lounge for a marginally more intimate assessment of what awaits as the club’s head coach. And yet, even with the star player sold and a transfer ban blocking significant incoming business, it rapidly became clear the new man is not one to flee from expectation.A sense of positivity permeated Lampard’s first public outing in the job. Yes, his arrival could be considered surprising given his coaching experience does not extend beyond a season finishing sixth in the Championship with Derby. Sure, the particular circumstances he inherits will make chasing down Manchester City – 26 points away last season – and Liverpool feel distinctly daunting.Yet a head coach who witnessed Roman Abramovich dismiss seven managers over the 11 years he played under his ownership is not going to be kidded into thinking too much has changed. He will just trust in his ability to justify the faith placed in him. “The reality is the owner has won 16 trophies in 16 years, enjoyed huge success, and runs it as he sees best, and his desire has always been the best for the club,” said Lampard, 41. “He has chosen me on that premise. I played here for many years and know there are standards. There is a baseline of being competitive. That expectation, quite rightly, will remain.Frank Lampard was welcomed back with open arms but can he buck the trend of short tenures for Chelsea managers appointed under Roman Abramovich? Here is the leaderboard (ranked by days in the job)There may be awkward times to endure when the true depth of a squad Lampard insists remains strong is exposed, but this club’s soul already feels restored. That was the immediate Lampard effect. He may have been rather guarded in some of his responses, wary of offering dangerous soundbites and warding off potential headlines, but it was still so refreshing, and not just because the man he had replaced used to smoke 60 a day. The fanbase is instantly appeased and enthused.Those in the front row of the audience – the director, Marina Granovskaia, the chairman, Bruce Buck, and the recently appointed technical and performance adviser, Petr Cech – could bask in the slick positivity that has greeted their appointment. Here, after all, was a man who had not felt the need to call any of those managers under whom he had learned so much as a player before deciding whether this was a sensible move. He had apparently not even spoken first‑hand to Abramovich, although that call will come.“I have spoken with Marina in depth because it is about how I work with the club and how they want me to work with them,” he said. “I will be speaking with the owner in pre-season, but one of the benefits of me being here is I don’t need huge conversations with him. The conversations I had with Marina were exactly as I expected: we want to be competitive yes, we want to bring young players through, but that is something I should look to do anyway and we want to win.His team will be “aggressive with plenty of energy, bravery on the ball, moving it quickly”, emulating the standard City and Liverpool have set. There will be opportunities for academy graduates to prove they merit greater involvement. “But they have to show they are good enough because we can’t lower our levels too much. This is Chelsea, so I’m not going to be doing young boys favours and put them in the team. They need to prove themselves.“We talk about losing Eden Hazard, one of the greatest players in the world, but it is still a hugely talented team. We haven’t been decimated, we still have a very strong squad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62beaf9c1a5fd8c256ddb59246b9dda8f839f83b/0_297_5472_3285/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e227d7c5a22d04b73ad854ad3aea73","title":"were you and your partner married by a loved one in an unofficial ceremony","story":"Who did you choose to conduct your ceremony and why?

It has had some notable successes, particularly live. Their marathon gigs, featuring everyone from Paul McCartney to Rizzle Kicks, have been widely acclaimed. And there has been clear, lasting benefit to at least some of the African artists involved: Malian desert blues quartet Songhoy Blues obviously owe their success to their talent rather than anyone’s patronage, but they first came to notice outside of the Bamako club circuit after working with Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner under the Africa Express banner.But the organisation’s albums have thus far been uneven – perhaps inevitably, given the circumstances of their creation. Throwing an eclectic selection of artists together, getting them to jam and trusting that the results will be magical expositions of the universal language of music is a great plan in theory, but the results have usually worked more as an intriguing document of what happened rather than thrilling listening. There have been highlights scattered around tracks that were perhaps more exciting to make than listen to, and a faint but pervasive sense that you really had to be there.The collective’s latest venture involves Albarn, along with Zinner and a suitably erse cast – grime rapper Ghetts and Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys among them – relocating to Johannesburg. It has proved controversial: UK-based artists Nabihah Iqbal and Yannick Ilunga (AKA Petite Noir) both publicly protested about contracts that signed their rights to the music they made away for a nominal £1 fee, the former accusing them of “21st-century colonisation”. Africa Express, a charity, responded by saying that while western artists were expected to give their time for free, African musicians working on their projects were paid, and any profits “go to artists and the promotion of African music”. The musical contents of EGOLI – which don’t seem to feature either Ilunga or Iqbal – should prove less isive.South African pop has enjoyed a fertile and exciting run in recent years. Its own variants on house music, from kwaito to gqom, and on hip-hop, have attracted considerable attention, as has the dense warp-speed electronics of the entirely homegrown shangaan. And there’s a distinct crackle of energy about the collaborations on EGOLI. You hear it on City Lights, where the Mahotella Queens, a veteran mbaqanga trio, team up with Zinner, British producer Georgia and Otim Alpha, pioneer of an electro take on traditional Achioli music. The result is rich, beautiful electronic pop music, a weirdly affecting hint of melancholy audible amid the pacy rhythm track and ravey synth stabs it sounds really commercial without resembling anything you’d hear on Radio 1. No Games, on which Ghetts spars with Port Elizabeth rapper and self-styled “president of female orgasm” Moonchild Sanelly, among a host of others, is equally great: sparse, funky, lightly dressed with marimba.For anyone not familiar with her career (which from afar looks pretty mind-blowing, involving ownership not merely of a clothing line but something referred to in her Wikipedia entry as a “naked club”), Sanelly is very much EGOLI’s breakout star. Your heart leaps a little every time she appears, not least on the remarkable Sizi Freaks, a tense, minimal gqom track over which she offers some forthright bedroom tips – “don’t stop, grab the nuts, don’t crush them, just brush them” – in a blithe sing-song.The album hangs together more coherently than its predecessor Maison des Jeunes, switching from pop-facing to something more subdued and traditional – Gruff Rhys and Zolani Mahola’s acoustic duet Absolutely Everything Is Pointing Towards the Light Muzi, Zola 7 and the Mahotella Queens’ The River – without jolting you. Albarn’s voice is so distinctive it means any track he appears on automatically sounds like Gorillaz, but for the most part you’re struck by how the western artists retreat into the background, as if urging the listener to take more notice of the local talent. It doesn’t feel like an act of grand munificence, more something they’re doing in service to the music. Johannesburg’s hazy R\u0026ampB doesn’t feel like Gruff Rhys performing with some African backing musicians, but something genuinely holistic.Listening to it, or another one of Sanelly’s star turns on Where Will This Lead Us To? (or indeed The Return of Bacardi, a fabulous, warped update on old Chicago house courtesy of DJ Spoko and FAKA) it’s hard not to find yourself thinking that if western pop currently seems a little homogenous and static, there’s a whole world of far fresher ideas out there – and opening one’s eyes to them might be a way forward. That’s presumably the whole point.unperfect – Looking for a HugThe latest girl group project from Xenomania sounds a world away from the brashness of Girls Aloud.

So close yet so far.”The singer added that she was aware “there couldn’t be a public concert as I am a woman” and that she wasn’t “trying to change the politics of the countries I visit” or “put other people in danger”.Stone’s Total World Tour, which started in Morocco in March 2014, has taken the singer to countries including Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Belize and Jordan. The purpose of the tour, according to Stone’s website, is to “bring loveliness in a form of music to every country on our planet”. Stone’s tour has also included charity work in Lebanon, Syria and Mauritius, where she supported Mo’zar Atelier Musique, a group that helps children access music lessons.“While Kish is considered a free zone, without visa regulation for tourists, engaging in any economic activity more than tourism needs previous consideration and a request for working visas via official channels, which the group unfortunately missed. Local authorities have advised the group about this mistake and visa regulations for any future visit.”The Iranian regime’s stance on music being performed in the country has thawed slightly since the revolution. All forms of music were banned immediately after the regime took control in 1979, but in the late 90s some restrictions were lifted under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, who allowed western classical music to be taught at Tehran University and permitted concerts where women could sing in front of other women.In 2005, then Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad banned western music from state radio and TV stations, saying the decision was meant to block “indecent and western music from the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting”.Women singing by themselves continues to be a taboo in Iran, with some exceptions being permitted for opera, but some have managed to circumvent the restrictions by “co-singing”, where they perform with others.Leila Alikarami, a human rights lawyer who has represented female musicians in Iran, said there were hopes that when Hassan Rouhani took control in 2013 there would be a more liberal approach to female musicians performing live in the country.“Human rights are still seen as a threat to national security by the regime,” she said. “We were hopeful of changes with Rouhani but it hasn’t happened. This is deep rooted culturally and in the judiciary.”Iran has strict controls on public concerts and any gig needs to be approved by the ministry of culture, which requires promoters and artists to complete forms stating the location of the event, number of attendees and several other details. In Alikarami’s experience the ministry can take anywhere from two months to a year to reply to requests and she has known of concerts – which have been approved previously – to be cancelled with little notice.Alikarami believes Stone should have been allowed to visit the country as she “clearly stated her intention was not to play”, but added that the situation in Iran is far worse for Iranian women who want to perform in their own country, saying the regime is “attacking the identity of Muslim women”.“It’s heartbreaking because these people have passion for music it’s not about making money it’s about performing in public and being heard,” she said.Mohammed Shabani, a PhD Researcher at SOAS University of London and an expert in Iranian issues, said that for Stone the situation, however inconvenient in the short term, is a net positive for her. “I’m sure Joss Stone and her team made a calculation: they go to Iran and there will be one of two outcomes, both of which are good for her,” he said.“A: You go, play a concert and are arrested and get publicity. B: You get detained and deported and make lots of headlines. It’s a win-win. For the regime, they probably didn’t want to take the chance that she would perform and create a scene.”Representatives for Stone and the Iranian embassy did not respond to the ’s request for comment.Iranian groups continue to push back against the strict rules, including Radio Khiaban, a site which hosts recordings of Iranian women singing in public in order to show “inspiring everyday performances and acts of resistance of women who are forced to segregation and exclusion”.Alikarami points out that women in Iran have faced discrimination when trying to perform for decades. “Women have been repressed by a patriarchal system before the regime in 1979,” she said. “It’s not always religion, sometimes it’s tradition.”Stone first rose to prominence as an unlikely 14-year-old pop prodigy from rural Devon, signing with EMI before releasing her debut album The Soul Sessions, which would mark her out as “a blonde, blue-eyed soul sensation” after selling 12 million copies and being nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2004.Dusty SpringfieldThe English pop star refused to play to segregated audiences in 1964 and was duly deported from South Africa for her anti-apartheid stand. Along with Gil Scott-Heron, her defiance was one of the few early shows of support from western acts.Hanns EislerDubbed the “Karl Marx of music” by the House Un-American Activities Committee, the German composer’s work had already been banned by the Nazis before he fled to the US and was eventually deported for being a communist in 1948, returning to Germany where he settled and wrote the national anthem for the GDR.21 SavageBorn in Newham, east London, 21 Savage (real name Shéyaa Bin Abraham-Joseph) was arrested in early 2019 and threatened with deportation from the US for overstaying his visa because of a – disputed – historic drug offence. The case is still pending.Paul McCartneyThe Beatle was deported from Japan in 1980 when he tried to bring a half-pound of marijuana into the country. The singer spent nine days in jail before returning home and deciding to break up Wings, who were supposed to tour Japan before his arrest.Slick RickSlick Rick is another UK-born hip-hop star who was facing deportation from the US after an attempted murder in 1991. The rapper with the famous eyepatch, was finally granted US citizenship in 2016 after a 23-year legal battle to avoid leaving the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fbf4d641b1e781a338a01800f587f533a3bdc59/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91811c6886fc19548e82b1cf0b05dcf6 880w","title":"everythings out of control stirling citizens on the tory succession","story":"View from the streets of Scottish city where Theresa May will deliver warning about threat to the union“Ooft,” says 16-year-old Jade Harrower behind her hand, “he’s a bit daft, don’t you think? And that’s me being polite.” On Thursday lunchtime in Stirling city centre, where Theresa May will later deliver a warning about the “first and greatest duty” of the future prime minister to preserve the union, any conversation about constitutional politics inevitably dissolves into exclamations of derision about Boris Johnson, her most likely successor.Sitting with her high school pals just past a monument to the Liberal leader and social reformer, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, Harrower’s confidence in the competence of the current Westminster leadership to negotiate a future for her country beyond Brexit is low.“He’s taking over at such a dodgy point,” she explains, “I can see it being a nightmare. Everything’s out of control now.”Her friend Morgan-Leigha McPheat, 17, believes that independence for Scotland is the only way out of the current Brexit impasse. “I understand that they don’t want to destroy the union, but looking at the future of Scotland, and the future of our own kids, independence is the best option.”“I think young people should have more say because it won’t affect older generations so much, but they are the ones who voted against independence last time. A lot of people our age have the same views.”May is travelling to Scotland on the eve of a Conservative leadership hustings between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in Perth on Friday evening, which is likely to focus heavily on their commitment to the future of the union, and their stated opposition to granting Holyrood powers to hold a second independence referendum.She has chosen to make her plea for unity not far from the site of Bannockburn, where Robert the Bruce led Scotland to victory over the army of King Edward II of England in 1314, a triumph of ordinary people over perfidious elites that is embedded deep in the collective national imagination.Meanwhile, recent opinion polls have indicated an increase in support for independence, particularly if Johnson becomes prime minister and presses ahead with a no-deal Brexit.Strumming through Bob Dylan hits on the Back Walk precinct, busking musician Alan Carberry offers a pantomime “Boo!” to the prospect of a Johnson premiership. “It’s a bit like when people were saying it was impossible that Trump could be US president, now it looks likely he’ll be prime minister and it’s pretty shocking.”Peter Russell, a visual artist, condemns the selection process as “ridiculous”. “A select group of party members are going to decide who my prime minister is, I find it unbelievable.” An independence supporter but not a habitual SNP voter, Russell is convinced that a Johnson premiership can only push Scots towards leaving the union.Carberry agrees: “You read a lot of people on Facebook now saying that if this isn’t a good reason to vote for independence then what is?”Nor is Russell convinced by May’s expected announcement of further funding for devolved nations from the UK government: “Theresa May might be on her legacy tour but she won’t be in charge for much longer, so I don’t think her promises are worth having any truck with.”But the prime minster is not entirely friendless in Stirling. Josie Day, who runs an art gallery and picture framers’ further along the Walk, agrees with Theresa May “all the way” that the UK is “stronger together”.Day is particularly concerned about the impact of independence on taxation, which she believes is already crippling businesses like hers under the SNP government at Holyrood. “Separatism has brought about a lot of hatred and upset in family groups and among friends,” she cautions. “People who believe in the union tend to keep quiet about it, but they come out to vote on the day.”While Day voted to remain within the UK and the EU, she is adamantly not one of those Scottish remainers who pollsters have lately observed considering independence more seriously as the prospect of no deal looms.The Scottish Conservative MP for Stirling, Stephen Kerr, noted recently that Johnson “has to project a different image to the people of Scotland”, and he has not won Day’s support. She would prefer Jeremy Hunt: “He looks more statesmanlike.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2bba58da1933dc55eff71d9c615dd85b5615c10/0_230_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25bc54806fd73d5af1a9fc238fce532b","title":"pms sudden passion for her precious union is as palatable as a cup of wet sick","story":"Only the Maybot would try to woo the Scots by reminding them how much England has done for themA few might call it ballsy. Most would call it an act of desperation. For the prime minister to come to Scotland to big up her part in the union as part of her Rolling Light Drizzle legacy tour is rather like Oliver Cromwell dropping in on Ireland to say things weren’t as bad as all that. Even her biggest fans north of the border only greet her with studied indifference. Still, no one could accuse Theresa May of not having a sense of humour. The location for her farewell to Caledonia was a tech start-up in Stirling, just a few miles from Bannockburn where the Scots inflicted a humiliating defeat on the English. History was about to repeat itself.There was no warm-up or introduction for May. Probably for the best. Least said soonest mended. Instead she just breezed through a side door, took a few strides to the lectern and began speaking. No one cared more deeply about the ‘PreciousTM Union’ than her. It was a preciousTM thing that needed to be nurtured and cherished. Which was obviously why this was the first time she had bothered to make the journey north since November. She loved Scotland so much, she could only appreciate it from afar. To get too close, would risk breaking it. We need to be more passionate about making the case for the union, she said in a flat monotone. The Maybot had spoken.After a short pause to wipe a speck of dust from her eye, May resumed her narrative. The Scots had been allowed the indulgence of an independence referendum back in 2014, the voters had chosen to stay part of the UK and now it was time for everyone to move on. Try to look at that referendum as a meaningless one night stand and recommit to the marriage. Besides, it had been the English that had bailed out the Scottish banks during the financial crisis and the English that had supported the oil industry when the price had collapsed, so it would be nice if the Scots could just be a bit more grateful for what they had got. This understandably went down like a cup of wet sick.As did May’s attempts to blame Nicola Sturgeon for the breakdown in relations between the UK and Scottish governments. It was the Scottish first minister who was doing her best to ensure devolution failed in order to trigger a second independence referendum, while she had worked tirelessly to make Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have a small say in their own affairs. Which might have been more convincing had she even once consulted the devolved governments about the Brexit process or not presided over the 900-day absence of a power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. Or done a confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP and alienated the rest of Northern Ireland for that matter.Still, she did have some strong words on Brexit. Well, strongish. After paying lip service to the fact that Scotland had voted overwhelmingly to remain, she argued that it was their duty to suck it up because of ... well, the union. You lose some, you lose some. But she was adamant that whoever took over from her shouldn’t mess about with the Good Friday Agreement – perhaps someone in the room might like to pass that piece of good news on to the Irish as she probably wouldn’t have time to let them know in person: things to do, places to go – nor risk the PreciousTM union in the pursuit of a no-deal Brexit.Not that there was much chance of either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt paying a blind bit of notice to a word she had said – why break the habit of a lifetime? – at the leadership hustings in York an hour or so later. Both men have long since realised that the 160,000 Tory members who will make one of them prime minister are totally deranged – most would throw Scotland under the wheels of one of Johnson’s imaginary wooden buses and marry Ann Widdecombe for a WTO Brexit – and have been outdoing one another to prove who is insane enough to be their leader. It can’t be long before transportation to the colonies, bear baiting and compulsory obesity for all five-year-olds will be government policy.On stage in York, Boris and Jeremy were soon at it again. Spending billions they didn’t have on promises they had no intention of keeping, while contradicting themselves at will. The hustings have degenerated into a dehumanising, degrading experience for everyone involved. Primarily for the two candidates themselves, though they lack the necessary self-awareness to even appear apologetic. The only value left is as a pilot show for Britain Hasn’t Got Talent. We are witnessing the rise of the PreciousTM Idiocracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d858b45c569302ab19ce6d72c88bbc87199202e/0_0_3403_2041/master/3403.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06a4409188652b02ebbec3e8a46b02bc","title":"chris froome absence tour de france chances","story":"Egan Bernal is strongly fancied as is defending champion Geraint Thomas but plenty of others – even the French – are hopefulFor the first time since he made his debut in July 2012, the Tour de France rolls away from Saturday’s Grand Départ without Chris Froome. Already, in the brasseries and cafes around the Grand Place in central Brussels, where this year’s Tour’s teams were presented to the public in warm evening sunshine, the talk is of who will fill the vacuum left by the four-times winner.Froome’s dramatic crash at the Critérium du Dauphiné has opened up the Tour. Most pundits point to his fast-rising Ineos teammate Egan Bernal as heir apparent, at the expense of the defending champion, Geraint Thomas, but plenty of others – even the French – rate their own chances.Romain Bardet, the doe-eyed, floppy-haired climber, more reminiscent of Eddie Redmayne than Eddy Merckx, is, as he is most years, the French favourite. Bardet’s mountain climbing abilities are not in doubt but his perennial resistance to improving his time-trialling skills means, with or without Froome, that his chances of success are slim.When asked, Bardet cited no fewer than 10 favourites for victory in Paris and also described the final Alpine week of racing as the hardest he had seen in the Tour.His team manager, Vincent Lavenu was keen to play down the impact of Froome’s absence. “It doesn’t change things that much,” Lavenu said. “Ineos is still as strong collectively. They still have Thomas, the defending champion, and Bernal, who’s a future champion. They have riders like Michal Kwiatkowski, Wout Poels, Dylan van Baarle, so the team is still full of big-name riders.”The staging of the Grand Départ pays tribute to the first Tour win, 50 years ago in July 1969, of the Belgian legend Merckx and is the 23rd time the race has started abroad. The first stage will pass through WoluweSaint-Pierre, where the five-times Tour winner grew up.If Merckx’s renown has since been surpassed by that of Eden Hazard among Belgian sports fans, his reputation among hardcore cycling aficionados remains intact and he is still referred to in glowing terms.But there are some other anniversaries that the Tour is not so keen to commemorate. Twenty years ago Lance Armstrong took the first of his seven wins, seizing control of the 1999 race less than three years after being diagnosed with testicular cancer.That success ushered in the darkest period in the Tour’s long and colourful history.The ghosts of the Armstrong era still haunt the Tour, as does the whiff of hypocrisy that surrounds the feting of Merckx, who tested positive three times during his career, which contrasts starkly with the continued shunning of Armstrong.Two decades after Armstrong’s first win many within the sport insist that there has been fundamental change while others believe it has been little more than a makeover.The spectre of doping is never far away, as was hinted at by the recent Operation Aderlass scandal, which clouded the opening days of this year’s Giro d’Italia and remains an active investigation.Armstrong himself, so well-versed that he could cite doping as his specialist subject, once counted Merckx as a mentor and close friend and will be podcasting at a distance throughout this year’s race. Yet even the American refuses to be drawn on the current state of the sport.“I’m too far removed,” he told NBC recently. “I don’t have access, I don’t have intel. But I’d like to think that they’re clean.” As the Tour prepares to hit the road once more, those sentiments will be fervently shared by the race organisers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c47131e0675f71e3cc3f072b8c7eeab420fc7a20/0_109_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b4cfea624a21896206c9e066401ba81","title":"tammy beaumont ashes australia england","story":"Ten years and four days: that’s how long it had been since an England player last hit a women’s ODI century against Australia. That impossibly long drought was finally broken at Leicester by Tammy Beaumont, who hit her maiden Ashes hundred in a gloriously confident display.Sadly for Beaumont, her effort was in vain: Australia chased down their 218-run target with four wickets to spare to go 4-0 up on points in the multi-format series, thanks to a 72-ball half-century from Ellyse Perry.It came after a nervy start for Australia, with Nicole Bolton and the in-form Alyssa Healy departing in successive overs at the top of the order to leave them 17 for two. Had England also snaffled Perry when she was still in single figures, things might have got interesting but a third umpire review of a lightning-quick Amy Jones stumping ruled that Perry had just got her foot back behind the line in time.As it was, by the time Anya Shrubsole’s second spell of the day yielded Perry’s wicket with a wide half-tracker that she toe-ended behind the stumps, Australia were already on course. A flurry of boundaries from Beth Mooney and Jess Jonassen was enough to finish the job.For England, the real problem was that their 50 overs had fizzled out into a damp squib, the home side sinking from 183 for five to 217 all out – Delissa Kimmince mopping up the tail to finish with her first career five-for. So often, this England team’s success has relied on a wagging tail: here their numbers 7-11 could not muster a single boundary between them.Earlier on, Beaumont had shared a half-century partnership with her captain, Heather Knight, but it was the former who had made almost all of the running, Knight taking 47 balls to muster 17 runs. Meanwhile Beaumont gleefully feasted runs off Perry’s shorter balls, while using the lap sweep to her advantage to create singles out of nowhere, before going big against the spinners.“I’ve been working really hard on trying to score off more balls,” Beaumont said. “That’s the first time I’ve got 100 in 100 balls, so I’m really happy with that. I’m always trying to improve.”“I felt good, but I probably got out at the wrong time – I should have been the one to manage the back end of that innings and get us up to 230, 240 and give us a bit more of a chance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949729dbb9223a0e71506e69f44cb6372001cb74/0_138_3801_2281/master/3801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a4210be48009327da4de1e4c4caca4e","title":"england team eoin morgan india australia cricket world cup","story":"Jason Roy is on form, Jofra Archer indispensable, so India and Australia want group wins to miss World Cup hosts in the semisSuddenly the square pegs are fitting into square holes. England have their semi-final at Edgbaston, where they like playing, and when Eoin Morgan said he was not bothered which side he would be playing against, it felt as if he was telling the truth rather than dutifully spinning. Their opponents will be India or Australia.England are starting to play with confidence and captain Morgan now seems to know his preferred team it is the one that played in the last two games. Unless conditions dictate otherwise – and this would only happen if there is a very dry, spin-friendly surface – Moeen Ali will probably continue to stick on the yellow bib. At the start of the tournament Moeen seemed an inked-in starter in England’s best XI. But stuff happens.The suspicion is that the England hierarchy was a bit more exasperated than they let on by Moeen’s final shot against Sri Lanka at Headingley and they feel there is enough variety in their bowling attack without him. Joe Root can propel a few off‑spinners if necessary. So there is a parallel, which may be oblique, ancient and only recognised by baby boomers but that is an insufficient deterrent for your correspondent: Moeen may finally have something in common with Jimmy Greaves back in 1966.England’s bowling attack has improved as the tournament has progressed. Jofra Archer must now be regarded as indispensable since he has always been selected, even when feeling “tightness” in his side Chris Woakes has gone from being the leakiest bowler to one of the meanest Mark Wood’s body has opted not to rebel and he has retained his place and his irrepressible optimism. To revert to the 1966 parallel, perhaps Liam Plunkett is the team’s Nobby Stiles, albeit with more teeth and a better haircut – the unglamorous, indomitable, invaluable workhorse who gets the job done in the middle (don’t worry, the Trevor BaylissAlf Ramsey comparison will not be pursued).England’s return to form has also coincided with the reappearance of Jason Roy, who has demonstrated that the modern player can defy the old truism that the only way to stay in form is to bat in matches in the middle. Like many of his peers Roy can feel in control of his game by working away in the nets, which is what he had to do once he recovered from the hamstring injury he acquired on 14 June. He has struck the ball exquisitely in the last two matches and somehow his presence spurs Bairstow on to greater heights. They seem to have a healthy rivalry.A feature of the best sides in the tournament has been the potency of their opening batsmen. Aaron Finch and David Warner have taken the pressure off Australia’s middle order in almost every game Rohit Sharma, who has hit four centuries in the competition, has done the same for India. Soon someone will take the crucial catches and early wickets will fall – so far Sharma has enjoyed three escapes on his way to his centuries. How the middle-order men, largely untaxed so far, react to the loss of early wickets will be critical.The likelihood is that India and Australia will prevail in their matches against Sri Lanka and South Africa on Saturday. In which case New Zealand will meet Australia at Old Trafford in the first semi‑final on Tuesday, an outcome that the Kiwis would probably favour. They relish contests against their rivals across the Tasman – despite the outcome of the last World Cup final. They know that they can beat them in a one-off game, though the presence of a fully fit Lockie Ferguson would help, as would some runs from anyone not called Williamson.The SharmaVirat Kohli axis has stabilised India throughout. It is no wonder that they have been batting conservatively in their early overs. India have had Mohammed Shami at No 8 – he averages 7.38 with the bat in one-day internationals – though if they continue to dispense with Kuldeep Yadav, which was their preferred option in their last match, against Bangladesh on Tuesday, then Bhuvneshwar Kumar at eight offers a little more reassurance.Both India and Australia will have the same goal on Saturday, which may further boost the confidence of Morgan’s side: to avoid England in their semi-final.

You can pick up a Nokia 105 (2017 edition) for about £15 or a dual-sim Nokia 106 (2018 edition) for about £16. These are only 2G phones but they have built-in FM radios, they can send texts, they are great for making phone calls and they are not based on Google or Apple technologies. A 3G or 4G phone would cost a bit more …This answers your question but it is obviously not the solution you are looking for …The problem is that most people – including me – want to use Googly things on their phones. Gmail is the dominant email service, YouTube is the dominant short video provider, Google Search and Google Maps are very useful and Google Chrome is the most widely used web browser. There may be viable and sometimes preferable alternatives but you have to make an effort to use them. Most people don’t want to make the effort.Indeed, it looks as though the next generation of candy-bar phones will also include Google. Nokia’s latest 4G feature-phone, the Nokia 8110 “banana phone”, runs the KaiOS operating system, in which Google has invested $22 million. The Alcatel Go Flip 2, JioPhone and Orange Sanza are alternative KaiOS phones available in North America, India and Africa respectively. (Kai is named from the Chinese word for open, not the undead protagonist in the Lexx science fiction series.)KaiOS includes WhatsApp – its main selling point – plus a web browser, Facebook, YouTube, Google Maps and Google Assistant. It’s claimed to be the second most popular operating system in India and could manage that in Africa. Some KaiOS phones cost less than $20.KaiOS started as a fork of B2G (Boot to Gecko), which was an open source continuation of Firefox OS, which Mozilla stopped developing at the end of 2015. Gonk, the operating system underneath Gecko (which is Firefox’s web-rendering engine) is a small Linux kernel derived from Google’s AOSP, the Android Open Source Project.The fact that we have, essentially, a duopoly in the smartphone business is not for want of trying. Microsoft entered the market with a version of Windows running on ARM-based smartphones and it even made Windows available free on small-screen devices. The people who owned Windows phones seemed to love them and in 24 countries it overtook Apple’s iPhone in market share. However, the lack of apps was a major stumbling block and Microsoft abandoned its challenge, having lost billions of dollars in the attempt.You can still buy Windows phones but most date from 2015-16 and will soon be out of support. I didn’t recommend buying them when they came out so I really wouldn’t recommend one now.Canonical also had a go at the smartphone market with its Linux-based Ubuntu Touch. It failed. In this case, the development was taken over by the UBports Community, which developed a port for the OnePlus One smartphone in 2015. There are now a few others but I don’t expect Ubuntu Touch phones to appear in your local high street.South Korea’s two smartphone manufacturers, Samsung and LG, would also love to have an independent operating system but success is unlikely. Samsung tried with Tizen, which was supported by the Linux Foundation. The Samsung Z series was launched in India and didn’t do well enough but Tizen is used in Samsung Gear smartwatches. LG could have a go with Palm’s Linux-based webOS, which it acquired from HP in 2013. WebOS first appeared on Palm Pre smartphones in 2009 but LG has mainly used it in smart TV sets.Sailfish started with another failed Linux project, Nokia and Intel’s MeeGo. The latest version uses a graphical shell from Jolla, the Finnish company that appears to be its major backer. Sailfish can be ported to more alternative smartphones than Ubuntu Touch but I can’t see any current phones with Sailfish pre-installed. The same is true for both e (formerly Eelo), which is a sort of de-Googled Android, and LineageOS, which is a reborn CyanogenMod.You main hope is Purism’s forthcoming Librem 5, which seems to be exactly what you want. Whether it can buck the trend remains to be seen.In general, the problem with Linux on smartphones looks much like its problem on PCs. Many and various groups enjoy developing new versions of the operating system, which are all more or less doomed from birth. None of them have the skills, the interests or the money to create viable platforms that include the hardware, apps, services, packaging, marketing, advertising, distribution and support on the sort of scale needed to sustain a real product. Without those, they are unlikely to attract much interest beyond hobbyists and enthusiasts.Things may change thanks mainly to the current American president. Trump sent China and the rest of the world a wakeup call by trying to exclude Huawei – the world’s second-largest smartphone manufacturer and the leader in 5G – from using American technology. Huawei was already developing its own Android app-compatible operating system, currently known as Hongmen OS, as an alternative. The potential loss of up to $30bn in sales per year suggests there will be no shortage of money or manpower for its future development.Indeed, China has a powerful incentive to replace all the American technology it uses with home-grown alternatives. This may take decades but in the long run, it will hurt Google, Intel, Qualcomm and numerous other US companies. The genie is out of the bottle and the Americans will never be able to put it back.Hongmen, aka Ark OS, may not have a lot of appeal in Europe but it could do well in Asian countries that already do more trade with China than with the US.Meanwhile, the EU’s latest antitrust case against Google should allow phone manufacturers to offer alternative browsers and search engines. It should also enable Android smartphone suppliers to sell phones with alternative versions of Android in Europe, which Google did not allow them to do before. A major player such as Samsung or Huawei could therefore test the market with a Google-free Android phone. In which case, you can vote with your wallet.A recent Washington Post story based on Disconnect.me technology found trackers were rife in the journalist’s iPhone apps. Google, of course, banned Disconnect Mobile from its Play store way back in 2014. In a blogpost, the company wrote: “Google refuses to explain their decision, other than to say that our app won’t be allowed if it interferes with any ads even ads that contain malware and steal your identity.”The app economy, like the web economy, is ultimately based on surveillance. That isn’t likely to change unless the EU does something about it. And so far, despite the GDPR and three antitrust cases against Google, the EU has left smartphone tracking revenues unharmed.Have you got a question?

Her living room is filled with bright and joyful prints created by herself and others. “I like so many artists and they have influenced my work. I particularly like Modigliani, Kandinsky and Picasso,” she says.Ezekiel lives with motor neurone disease (MND), and is unable to move from the neck down. Her own art – which can take months to make – is created using eye-gaze technology. An infrared bar picks up her eye movements, and this operates an on-screen mouse and keyboard. “Eye-gaze has allowed me to create again,” she says.She uses this technology not just to make her art, but in many parts of her life – from operating the TV controls to paging her carer, to using social media and writing emails. It has also enabled her to campaign on disability issues and volunteer for the MND Association, and Lifelites (which provides specialist technology for children in hospices), as well as other charities. She has won many awards, including Third Sector volunteer of the year 2016.Ezekiel’s feelings are mirrored by Microsoft, whose mission is to empower every person. This is achieved through integrating accessibility tech, such as the operating system to support eye-gaze technology, seamlessly alongside its Windows 10 and Office 365 suite.Ezekiel, who lives in Hendon, north-west London, was diagnosed with MND in 2000. At the time she was 34, and seven months pregnant with her second child. She was referred to a neurologist during an antenatal appointment the doctor immediately realised that her arm weakness and slurred speech were not due to pregnancy. Ezekiel was diagnosed with MND two months later and within a year was unable to use her hands. “I think I’ve become stronger since my diagnosis, because I’ve been through some very difficult times,” she explains.Although Ezekiel had always loved painting and drawing, and had been on a foundation course after she left school, earning a living had taken precedence over art. She worked as a personal assistant in publishing, with her ambition to become a fine artist overtaken by marriage and children then, later, by MND.In 2010, she began to use eye-gaze technology. Although she had tried different sorts of assistive technology in the years following her diagnosis, this had often proved frustrating and uncomfortable. But using her eyes to operate the computer was a huge improvement, and in 2012 she began using this tech to create art with a software program called Revelation Natural Art.As for her art practice: “I feel like it’s still developing. I’m still learning about the art software I use.” Her colourful paintings can take months to complete, but, she says: “I’ve always been very determined, my mum calls it stubborn!”Ezekiel is also glad to support other artists using this technology. “I know a few eye-gaze artists, but art is a very inidual practice and we all do our own thing. I’m often asked about the software I use and for advice, which I’m always happy to give.”The technology is also becoming more accessible to other users. Microsoft is now on hand to offer guidance and support to potential eye-gaze artists, or anyone who wants to use assistive technology with their products. The company has worked on bringing eye-gaze technology to more users and, as a result, Windows 10 includes built-in tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. This enables people with disabilities to use a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C version Ezekiel uses, which unlocks the Windows operating system. Users will then be able to operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard using just their eyes. This tech also enables text-to-speech, so when someone has typed a phrase or sentence using their eye tracker, this text can then be “spoken” by the computer.Ezekiel is very keen to improve access to technology for other people who are no longer able to speak or express themselves. And for herself, she stresses that there is always more to find out and more ways to develop as an artist. “Eye-gaze painting is very different to using hands and it’s still a learning curve for me.”Sarah Ezekiel’s art is available via her website sarahezekielWhether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

What a ludicrous way to yank on our heartstringsAbout a decade ago, the popular science podcast Radiolab broadcast an episode about a whale that had got tangled up in fishing netting. It was a dramatic retelling of the incident by those involved in helping the cetacean get free, and it ended on an otherworldly note: once loose, the whale did not simply leave, but made its way around each of the humans that surrounded it, as if to express gratitude for what they had done. It was a spectacular tale that has remained in my mind since. But it was followed by an animal psychologist patiently explaining that gratitude is a human emotion, and that animal behaviour is essentially incomparable. The whale was, in all likelihood, not grateful.Serengeti (BBC One) is not having any of that. The six-part series is an attempt to reinvent the natural history format. This is a grand ambition, though an unsurprising one, given that it is the brainchild of Simon Fuller, best known for managing the Spice Girls and creating the Pop Idol franchise. This is, we are told immediately, “a dramatised story based on the real lives of Africa’s most charismatic animals”, which must make it the Made in Chelsea or Towie of nature docs. The undeniably spectacular footage has been manipulated into storylines by drama writers and given an extra flourish by music commissioned not so much to tug on viewers’ heartstrings as to yank them into submission.Fuller has said he was inspired to make the series after he concluded that a lot of wildlife issues come from the fact that humans lack empathy with animals. Shot over two years on a private reserve, these animals are given soap-worthy storylines, narrated with careful BBC gravity by John Boyega. Kali the lioness has had cubs outside of her pride (out of pridelock?) and the male lion will kill them if he realises he’s not the baby daddy. Kali tentatively tries to return to the pride. “Do they know her secret?” purrs Boyega. No DNA test is needed. The secret is very much out even as she tries to pretend nothing’s wrong. Kali is seen off and exiled, and the music swells, as Boyega ends the scene: “She’s learning the hard way. When you fly against the wind, it’s a bumpy ride.”The baboons get an even fancier plot. Bakari is pining for Sabira, who has left him to shack up with the brutish chief baboon, who rules the Great Rock with an iron fist. Bakari, we are told, “now spends his days brooding on the injustice of it all”. Does he? How do we know? Has he started listening to Coldplay ballads while he scratches Bakari 4 Sabira over and over in his diary?While he tries to win her back, the hyenas are attempting to pass wisdom and courage down through the matriarchy. Mongooses are “making friends” with warthogs (their symbiosis is truly fascinating, if less chummy than this makes it seem). An adolescent elephant feels as if he’s in the shadow of his new baby brother, and does not know where he fits in any more. It’s all very EastEnders: Off to the Plains.Despite its A-list narrator and bombastic approach, Serengeti somehow maintains the feel of an educational film for schoolchildren. It’s unfair, in one sense, to find that side of it grating, because its intentions are made clear from the beginning. It cannot be accused of being disingenuous about what it does with the footage it has taken, as certain documentaries have been in the past Boyega is even credited as “storyteller” rather than narrator. This is documentary as theatre. I’m not saying gritty realism is always a more appealing approach, but this all-out anthropomorphism sometimes reaches beyond what it can deliver, which is a shame because, visually at least, it’s a stunner.Just when the whiff of being talked down to threatens to overwhelm, however, the show reaches its emotional climax. It’s all very well to smother animals in human emotions, but the animal world is brutal and cruel, and cosy reconciliations are few and far between. I could feel the manipulation happening as if a puppet master were making me dance, but the death scenes – one painted as a selfless sacrifice, another as if it were the end of Titanic (“She made him brave. She gave him something to fight for”) – had an impact. At last, Serengeti began to carry me along with it. If this is entertainment, then at least it entertains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c1a14a5a69fdc4db435a9a9cdc873bb63fb39f1/0_24_1196_718/master/1196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75f53b6695a3af4684cf79feecb67bd","title":"ice cream los angeles instagram influencers","story":"Joe Nicchi has had enough of self-proclaimed influencers wanting free cones for publicity. Now he’s the one going viralCustomers at Joe Nicchi’s ice-cream truck have increasingly had the same demand: give us your ice-cream for free.CVT Soft Serve, a popular truck in Los Angeles, has started to receive weekly requests from self-proclaimed Instagram “influencers” who promise to post a photo of Nicchi’s ice-cream – if they don’t have to pay. Nicchi has always said no, but this week he found an unusual way to profit off of the influencers: he publicly told them to go away.Nicchi went viral after posting a sign that said “influencers pay double”, writing on Instagram that he would “never give you a free ice-cream in exchange for a post”. The image, tagged #InfluencersAreGross, spread around the globe, and now Nicchi says his business is booming, attracting fans across southern California who share his disdain of influencers.“We’re the anti-influencer influencers,” he told the  on Wednesday. “It’s weird … but I think it’s really fun. I hope it inspires small businesses to hold their own and tell people to fuck off.”Some brands and businesses now rely on Instagram “stars” to advertise their products and services, giving away free meals and hotel stays to people who post positively about the experience. The phenomenon has become so pervasive that some Instagrammers can easily scam companies. One Instagram influencer recently staged a “surprise” wedding engagement but had actually sent an itinerary to marketers months prior. It’s so trendy to be an influencer that some people have taken to pretending their content is sponsored when it’s not.Nicchi understands the importance of promotion. He’s a working actor in LA, who started CVT Soft Serve in 2014 as a way to supplement his income.“This is a money-making thing. I can’t give away my ice-cream for free,” he said, noting that he had paid for his first truck with his salary from shooting a commercial.The soft serve at CVT (which stands for his three flavor offerings: chocolate, vanilla, or twist) and his vintage-looking truck are very Instagrammable. Influencers quickly noticed. In his first year, he got a small handful of influencer offers, typically people emailing suggesting promotional deals in exchange for free ice-cream.“They love using the word ‘exposure’. It’s so ridiculous,” he said.But the frequency of the requests began to escalate – and became more uncomfortable as they started happening in person, said Nicchi: “The most painful thing for me is when they approach me at the truck.”It never made sense to him: “Are you out of your mind? This is four dollars. But obviously they wouldn’t be asking if people weren’t saying yes.”At times, the requests were particularly offensive. He said an assistant to a famous actor – a woman on a television show who he declined to name – recently asked if he would donate ice-cream to the cast and crew. In exchange, the actor offered to take a photo at his truck.His response: “As much as I’d love to do that, I don’t think my kid’s school accepts celebrity photos as a form of tuition payment.”The assistant responded with a nasty and vaguely threatening message, he said, along the lines of: “I should be careful with my words … This is a very small town.”Nicchi eventually became so tired of influencers that he put up his anti-influencer sign at the truck, making clear that people who requested a free cone would get the opposite – they’d have to pay $8 instead of $4. A customer took a photo and posted it to Reddit, which then went viral.He said he had since gotten interview requests and news coverage from across the world, and he is loving it. The number of customers doubled overnight, and he has earned thousands of new followers on Instagram.“There’s something so redeeming about outing influencers,” he said, adding that many small businesses have written to him thanking him for speaking up. “I hope that more people do not allow likes and comments and followers to hold weight in the business. I want people to go to a restaurant because the food and service is fantastic.”Brittany Hennessy, an author who has written about influencers, said companies with marketing budgets can benefit from working with social media personalities, and that a giveaway can pay off. But a small food truck may not a good fit, she said: “People will try and get anything for free … No real influencer would ask for a four-dollar ice-cream.”While Nicchi is happy to promote his own business on social media, he said he didn’t want to depend on the platform. “If Instagram went away tomorrow, our truck would still survive. I don’t know that your ‘influencer’ business would.”Nicchi offered to let the  try his ice-cream, under one condition: that the reporter pay for the cone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee0901f1350f92a763c668dbbf485b8062c58af1/0_179_612_367/master/612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0d89a76063d10d1816580b9f6d7d9f","title":"earthquake southern california largest in decades","story":"No serious damage or injuries reported after 6.4 magnitude earthquake, the most powerful to strike region since 1994The largest earthquake to hit southern California in decades rumbled across the region on Thursday morning, striking a remote part of the state with a magnitude of 6.4.The earthquake’s center was near the small city of Ridgecrest, near Death Valley national park and about 100 miles (160km) from Los Angeles. There were reports of people in Las Vegas and Los Angeles feeling the tremors.There were no immediate reports of serious damage or injuries after the earthquake struck at 10:33am. A series of small aftershocks followed.It was the most powerful earthquake to strike the region since 1994, when the 6.7 magnitude Northridge earthquake hit the populated San Fernando Valley. The Northridge earthquake caused 57 deaths and billions in dollars of damages from collapsed buildings and destroyed freeways.One of the world’s foremost seismologists, Lucy Jones, told reporters that CalTech’s seismology lab received a warning about 48 seconds before the shaking started.Jones warned much larger aftershocks should be expected within the next 24 hours.Though there are fears of the so-called “big one” earthquake striking the West Coast in the near future, Californians responded to the earthquake on social media with characteristic calm.The director, Ava DuVernay, shared her Los Angeles-born grandmother’s unflustered response to the quake on Twitter:While others joked about the small impact the earthquake had in major Californian cities:John Vidale, professor of seismology at the University of Southern California (USC), said if the earthquake had hit the city of LA, there could have been major consequences.“It’s a big enough earthquake to cause considerable damage,” he told the , comparing it to the 6.3-magnitude earthquake in the city of Christchurch in New Zealand, which flattened parts of the city in 2011 and killed 185 people. “If this had hit in Los Angeles, there would probably be a five or 10-mile area that was badly damaged. We’ve come along way since the 1970s, but there are still a lot of vulnerable structures out there.”The fire department in Kern county said the Ridgecrest regional hospital was undergoing evacuations, but the extent of the damage was unclear. Fire officials in nearby San Bernardino county said there were multiple buildings with minor cracks, broken water mains, power lines down and rock slides, but that there were no injuries or fires reported.Photos inside grocery stores and shops in Ridgecrest showed significant damage, with items knocked off shelves throughout the aisles. Officials said at least five fires were reported in the area.Even though the earthquake was outside of the city of LA, it could serve as a wake-up call for people to make sure they are prepared, Vidale said: “It’ll help put people in the right frame of mind.”The professor said he was also surprised at how strongly he felt the quake at USC in LA: “At first I felt the swaying, then I felt a pretty distinct rattling, and could see the blinds moving back and forth … I didn’t know if it was going to turn into something more violent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eb3bfc6efaf1e15c969c39a6beea1529d557c82/28_163_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e17131d0c88f628b81c6631b8c3ffc2a","title":"is a new generation taking over the democratic party podcast","story":"Kamala Harris was the big winner of the first round of Democratic party debates in the US.

I think we need to treat each other with care.”For all the unity it has shown so far in its negotiations with the UK, the EU is straining to keep its many different constituencies onside across a range of other issues. The next five-year term offers more of the same.The ergence in values that threatens to cripple the bloc was neatly highlighted at a summit this month when Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic refused to sign up to a communique that committed to a climate-neutral EU by 2050 – a target that was already seen as too wishy-washy by green lobby groups, given the gravity of the climate emergency.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, wants to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C at a September summit. He had written to Donald Tusk, the outgoing European council president, asking the EU to show leadership on the world stage – and it could not.The three naysayers are seeking extra recompense for making green changes to their economies in the upcoming seven-year budget known as the multiannual financial framework (MFF), but they will face stern challenge from members, such as the Netherlands, which are firmly opposed to the EU being a “transfer union”.Indeed the negotiations over the MFF, optimistically scheduled to have finished in May, are predictably proving to be a major headache, leading the EU budget commissioner, Günther Oettinger, to recently warn: “It’s not really five minutes to midnight, it’s almost five past midnight already.”The package asks net recipients such as France and Germany to pay more as a trade-off for less being handed over in cohesion funds to the central and eastern European states, and more being invested in scientific research and development. But failure to find agreement by the end of October could lead to the EU being unable to fund the next round of Horizon Europe research and development programmes.The difficulties in the talks are understandable. The ergence in values is matched by an economic ergence from east to west and north to south that the EU has failed to bridge, despite the almost existential threat it posed during the eurozone crisis, when economies unable to borrow on the market had to come cap in hand to Berlin, only to be put on a humiliating diet of cuts as the price for help.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has championed a eurozone budget, to allow the EU to act as a sovereign nation in times of trouble, but there has only yet been agreement on a tiny symbolic pot. No wonder, then, that the populist Italian government has raged at Brussels meddling in its tax and spend plans, which it says is necessary to boost its struggling economy.But as the new leaders in Brussels – Ursula von der Leyen and Christine Lagarde as the first female presidents of the European commission and European Central Bank respectively, and Charles Michel as European council president – move into their offices this autumn, it will be Brexit that will be sucking up their time and energy.It is certain that the next British prime minister, likely to be Boris Johnson, will not secure the increasingly outlandish potential concessions being touted by the two candidates in the Tory leadership race.The battle might then be to deal with the economic costs of a no-deal Brexit and a toxic relationship with London at a time when Donald Trump’s White House piles on the pressure through tariffs on trade and China doubles down in its investments in Africa, leaving the EU trailing behind in emerging markets there. Merkel’s commitment to avoiding a row over personnel suddenly becomes more understandable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b756e3e2cd4a610e23fa65d94896add2d6e0a995/0_25_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b281cef4dcfa5ee3500712150fc9403f","title":"germans condemn own candidate for top eu job ursula von der leyen","story":"Ursula von der Leyen is so isive at home that Germany abstained from the vote to nominate herIf the European parliament approves Ursula von der Leyen’s nomination in two weeks’ time, the German defence minister will make for an unusual European commission president: a consensus candidate who has won the approval of western liberals and eastern rightwingers, yet is proving isive in her home country.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has praised the 60-year-old for having “the DNA of the European community”, while the conservative Polish newspaper Gazeta Polska has hailed her nomination as a “historic choice”. However, in Germany the prospect of a German filling the commission presidency for the first time in 52 years has been met with outcries across the political spectrum.The former leader of the Social Democrats (SPD) Martin Schulz described Von der Leyen as “the government’s weakest minister”, while his SPD colleague Sigmar Gabriel, a former vice-chancellor, called her nomination “an unprecedented act of political trickery”.The Greens bemoaned Von der Leyen’s nomination as an “old-school backroom deal”, the pro-business Free Democrats said she was “not the best candidate”, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said her selection would amount to “cheating voters” and even Manfred Weber, the candidate that Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union had originally fielded for the top commission post, lamented a “sad day for European democracy”.Katarina Barley, a former SPD justice minister who is now one of the new European parliament’s vice-presidents, said she would vote against her former cabinet colleague – a move endorsed by leading German newspapers such as Süddeutsche Zeitung.Von der Leyen was an “inappropriate” choice, the paper said, because her track record in the defence ministry was so poor that she should long ago have resigned. “She will be unable to cope with the commission presidency,” it added.In a bizarre twist, Germany was the only of the 28 EU member states to abstain from the vote to nominate her.Few of Von de Leyen’s critics question that her CV ticks the right boxes, however. Born in Brussels to one of the first pan-European civil servants, she speaks fluent French and English, and built up a profile in the early years of her career with a bold commitment to a “United States of Europe, modelled on federal states like Switzerland, Germany or the US”.Many German commentators note the progress made under her current cabinet brief, defence integration. Her diplomatic effort in organising the 2016 Nato mission in the Aegean Sea in response to the refugee and migrant crisis required support from both Greece and Turkey, and is said to have won her admirers in Brussels.During her time in charge of Germany’s family ministry, from 2005 to 2009, she confounded expectations by radically expanding nurseries and parental pay in 2017, she voted for same-sex marriage when her mentor Merkel voted against.But since taking over defence in 2013, Von der Leyen’s popularity has plummeted – she sits second from bottom in Der Spiegel’s approval ratings monitor.Her defenders say being in charge of Germany’s underfunded military is a poisoned chalice – the job used to be known as the “ejector seat” because it curtailed the careers of so many of her predecessor. The fact that the first woman to hold the post has survived is testimony to her staying power, they add.However, at least one of the scandals surrounding the defence ministry is closely linked to Von der Leyen: a parliamentary committee is investigating accusations of nepotism in connection to the allocation of contracts worth hundreds of millions of euros to external consultants. One management consultancy firm awarded with jobs was McKinsey, where her son works as an associate.By focusing her reform efforts of the armed forces on “soft factors” such as working hours and nurseries, Von der Leyen is accused of having ignored bigger challenges around training and equipment – and lost support among the military in the process.“To put it mildly: German soldiers don’t feel very loved by her,” said journalist Thomas Wiegold, a leading chronicler of the country’s military. Relations reached a nadir in 2017, when she accused her troops of having an “attitude problem”.Yet Wiegold said Von der Leyen was only partially to blame for scandals that have plagued her ministry, and said she compared favourably to predecessors who managed to say the right things to please troops while at the same time signing off significant budget cuts. In May, she announced a €5bn (£4.4bn) increase in the German defence spending, the biggest since the end of the cold war.The force with which German politicians have attacked Von der Leyen’s EU nomination is more easily explained by the disappointment that followed the collapse of the so-called “spitzenkandidaten” process of appointing the commission president, whereby the main party bloc in the European parliament nominate a lead candidate for the role, even though that candidate can only be voted in one country.Aborting the process amounted to “deceiving and cheating on voters” who had been sold the system as a crucial step to democratising the EU, according to a former German vice-president of the commission.“If you had to invent a way to further disillusion in democracy and politics Europe, then you would come up exactly with what has happened now,” Günter Verheugen told Deutschlandradio. “The damage is great and the consequences cannot yet be foreseen.”Yet critics of “spitzenkandidaten” say the system was a German invention that was never truly accepted as an official procedure by most other member states. None of the three top contenders – Weber, the SPD’s Frans Timmermans and the Danish liberal Margrethe Vestager – managed to gain a clear majority among MEPs.In the light of that, Von der Leyen was “a decent solution”, said the centre-left German broadsheet Die Tageszeitung. “She has experience and respect on the European stage, she stands for a moderate Merkel-CDU, and she won’t allow herself to be bullied by any of the heads of state.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4210488bf51e1f37694653be5db811230361924/0_204_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce8c1d028e9e1ead0d6839a7bacb797d","title":"royal marines gibraltar tanker oil syria eu sanctions","story":"Iran summons UK ambassador over incident off Gibraltar as tensions escalate over nuclear dealRoyal Marines have helped seize an Iranian supertanker suspected of carrying oil to Syria off the coast of Gibraltar, escalating tensions between the UK and Tehran as the agreement aimed at halting Iran’s nuclear programme unravels.A detachment of nearly 30 British troops working with the Gibraltarian police intercepted the vessel, believed to be carrying 2m barrels of oil, in a dramatic manoeuvre Spain said had been conducted at the request of the US.Tehran responded by summoning Britain’s ambassador to its foreign ministry to explain what it described as an “illegal seizure”, which had been earlier described by the UK as enforcing the EU’s sanctions regime against Syria.Marines from 42 Commando were involved in the overnight seizure, with some landing on the ship’s deck by rapidly descending down ropes suspended from a Wildcat helicopter, and the rest following up via speedboat.A grainy black and white image from a thermal camera released by the Ministry of Defence on Thursday showed the helicopter hovering over one end of the ship, intercepted heading east through Gibraltarian waters.Further colour pictures were released showing marines onboard Grace 1, whose ownership had not initially been clear, but whose origin was later confirmed by the Iranian foreign ministry.Its spokesman tweeted: “Following the illegal seizure of an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar by British Royal Marines, the UK envoy to Tehran has been summoned to the ministry of foreign affairs.”MoD sources said British troops were at all times acting under the direction of the Gibraltar police. The marines provided the technical expertise to allow the tanker to be boarded at sea.But the British position appeared to be contradicted by Spain, whose acting foreign minister, Josep Borrell, said Gibraltar had seized Grace 1 after a request from the US to Britain to pick up the tanker laden with crude oil.The action comes at a time of heightened tensions between the US and Iran. Iran has been accused of sabotaging oil tankers in the strait of Hormuz, a policy of brinkmanship that analysts say is designed to show the US there is an economic cost to the Trump administration’s decision to pull out of the 2015 nuclear deal and impose economic sanctions.White House national security adviser John Bolton welcomed the seizure of the ship. “Excellent news: UK has detained the supertanker Grace I laden with Iranian oil bound for Syria in violation of EU sanctions,” Bolton tweeted. “America \u0026amp our allies will continue to prevent regimes in Tehran \u0026amp Damascus from profiting off this illicit trade,” he said.The UK Foreign Office faced a dilemma over the past few days knowing that if it seized the Iranian oil ship, as requested by the US, it risked deeply antagonising Tehran, which is desperate to increase its oil exports.Iran, according to some officials, is now exporting as little 200,000 barrels per day, and needs that to be closer to 600,000 to keep its economy afloat.But the Foreign Office reasoned that it had a legal and moral duty to impound any ship that was heading to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. It was the Iranian’s surprise decision to enter Gibraltarian waters with its communications transponders on that left the UK with the option to impound the vessel.In making its decision, the UK had to weigh the possible knock-on effect on the Iran nuclear deal, as well as reprisals against British diplomats in Tehran that work in an embassy that was trashed by Iranian protesters in this century.The UK insists it has no objections to Iran seeking to increase its oil exports, but only so long as it does not sell its products in breach of EU sanctions.Officials were not sure how Iran would react to the British military action, but the decision to summon the UK ambassador is a signal that Tehran views the episode as proof that Britain is not truly committed to helping the Iranian economy weather the effect of secondary sanctions.The 28 members of the ship’s crew were questioned onboard by Gibraltarian authorities. They were mostly Indian nationals but there were also some Ukrainians and Pakistanis, the territory’s government said.Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar’s chief minister, thanked the efforts of the “brave men and women” from the marines and the local agencies involved in the operation, and confirmed Grace 1 had been detained.“This action arose from information giving the Gibraltar government reasonable grounds to believe that the vessel, the Grace 1, was acting in breach of EU sanctions against Syria,” he said.“In fact, we have reason to believe that the Grace 1 was carrying its shipment of crude oil to the Banyas refinery in Syria.”Grace 1 was travelling east through the strait of Gibraltar. Tracking data from Lloyd’s List, a specialist shipping website, showed it had begun its voyage in Iran, travelling around Africa, before it passed through Gibraltarian territorial waters. Mapping data showed it sailed a longer route to the mouth of the Mediterranean, around the southern tip of Africa, instead of via the Suez Canal in Egypt.Panama’s Maritime Authority said on Thursday night that the ship was delisted from Panama’s international boat registry as of 29 May after it received an alert indicating that the Grace 1 had participated in or was linked to terrorism financing. Lloyd’s List reported Grace 1 had “a complex ownership chain” and was controlled by Russian Titan Shipping, a subsidiary of TNC Gulf, a Dubai-based shipping company. Executives connected with both companies hold Iranian university and technical qualifications, or list their names in Farsi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff9b7482bf9763932b8ed03621881fb515008072/0_12_979_587/master/979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a89e8b55dee51e6806c40e2569609f3","title":"venezuela un report nicolas maduro violations against dissenters","story":"In withering report, human rights chief details how Maduro’s security forces allegedly torture members of the oppositionThe UN has issued a withering appraisal of the human rights situation in Venezuela, as horrific details emerged of the injuries inflicted on a navy captain allegedly tortured to death during a crackdown on alleged plotters against president Nicolás Maduro.A report by UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet – which follows a three-day mission to the South American country last month – accuses Maduro’s security forces of committing a series of “gross violations” against Venezuelan dissenters and urges him to disband a notorious special forces group blamed for a wave of politically-motivated killings.The 16-page document also contains chilling details of the techniques allegedly being used by Venezuela’s security and intelligence services to interrogate and intimidate members of the political opposition, as Maduro battles to retain power.The report says that in scores of cases identified by researchers from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) “women and men were subjected to one or more forms of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including electric shocks, suffocation with plastic bags, water boarding, beatings, sexual violence, water and food deprivation, stress positions and exposure to extreme temperatures”.“Security forces and intelligence services … routinely resort to such practices to extract information and confessions, intimidate, and punish the detainees,” it adds.The report is also highly critical of FAES, a shadowy special forces unit activists suspect has been tasked with subduing opposition to Maduro in Venezuela’s impoverished periphery.The report said Bachelet’s team had interviewed relatives of 20 young men killed by FAES between June 2018 and April this year, all of whom described a similar modus operandi. Heavily-armed, balaclava-wearing agents would storm homes and separate their targets from their families before shooting them.“According to their relatives, almost all of the victims had one or more shots in the chest,” the report said.Maduro’s government rejected the “distorted” report in an 11-page rebuttal that accused Bachelet of offering “a selective and openly biased vision” of human rights in Venezuela. “The imprecisions, mistakes, descontextualizations and false claims are innumerable,” it said.The UN report was released amid growing outrage over last Friday’s killing of Rafael Acosta, a Venezuelan navy captain who had been detained during a roundup of supposed anti-Maduro conspirators.Acosta’s wife has claimed he was tortured to death by military counter-intelligence officers – claims supported by a copy of the homicide squad’s preliminary autopsy that was leaked to a pro-government newspaper on Wednesday.Doctors reportedly identified internal bleeding in Acosta’s digestive tract, colon and neck as well as a pulmonary embolism and broken ribs.A separate report claimed Acosta had suffered 16 broken ribs and a whiplash-like back injury during the alleged torture session.At a press conference in Caracas on Thursday, opposition lawmaker Delsa Solorzano said the autopsy left in no doubt what had happened.“There are lots of technical words that those of us who aren’t doctors can’t fully understand,” Solorzano told reporters. “But at the end of day what they mean is they beat him to death.”Venezuelan authorities have moved quickly to portray the killing as the act of a small group of intelligence officers, acting independently.On Monday attorney general Tarek Saab – a close Maduro confidant – said he had ordered two agents suspected of involvement in the “unfortunate incident” to be arrested on manslaughter charges.Saab promised an “objective, independent and impartial” investigation and said the culprits would receive “exemplary punishment”.Bachelet’s report suggested neither was likely to happen.It said: “The Attorney-General’s Office has regularly failed to comply with its obligation to investigate and prosecute perpetrators … Institutions responsible for the protection of human rights, such as the Attorney-General’s Office, the courts and the Ombudsperson, usually do not conduct prompt, effective, thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigations into human rights violations and other crimes committed by State actors, bring perpetrators to justice, and protect victims and witnesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9ed2a388c956fcbacbe270afa7d399013fc33c7/596_122_3517_2110/master/3517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d14c11352e4b79dc56727022fa1dc1","title":"lifting the lid on japans poo museum in pictures","story":"Japan’s culture of cute has embraced poo, which gets a pop twist at the Unko Museum in Yokohama, near Tokyo.

One depicts the relief of the Siege of Derry in 1689, the precursor to the Battle of the Boyne the other shows the local Ulster Volunteers in training in 1913 as they prepared to resist Home Rule.On Saturday, the 26 members of Newtowncunningham True Blues, Loyal Orange Lodge 1063, will march behind that banner in the “Donegal Twelfth” in nearby Rossnowlagh.On the coast near Ballyshannon, it is best known as a surfing beach. Yet every year, on the Saturday before the Twelfth of July, Orangemen from the Republic of Ireland – counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Donegal – accompanied by lodges from the North, march through the narrow country lanes to the demonstration field before enjoying an ice-cream on the beach or rolling up their trouser legs for a paddle.“It’s the one day we march in our own country,” says the County Grand Master, David Mahon. “It’s part of our tradition and our culture, and it’s a day out for people who maybe wouldn’t have seen each other since last year. It’s just the local Twelfth.”Stewart McClean, the Deputy Master of Newtowncunningham lodge, has been coming to Rossnowlagh since he was a child. The Donegal Twelfth is among his earliest memories. “It rained and rained until we were about to go home.”For him, membership of the Orange Order is about the Protestant faith, family tradition, and a celebration of freedom.“There are strong family ties,” he explains. “Both of my grandfathers belonged to the Orange, so it wasn’t if I was coming here, it was when.”Inside the lodge, the smell of fresh paint is everywhere. Though founded in 1911, the building is brand new, rebuilt after the previous lodge was destroyed in an arson attack in 2014.“I know they say Ireland’s changing,” says lodge secretary Keith Roulston, “but whenever this hall was burned, where did the tolerance go, where did the inclusiveness go? It went up in smoke.”Hardest for them was the knowledge that the attack had been premeditated: “You started to question things,” says McClean. “You would walk up and down the street and say to yourself, ‘I wonder does he know anything, does she know anything’?”Roulston is a farmer. “It’s difficult now. The fire changed things. A lot of us are farmers, so we’re totally exposed. I had to go and get sheds and things insured.“We all have children and families. Ireland portrays itself as a place where immigrants can come in and be accepted. Well, I don’t know how they’re going to accept anyone if they can’t accept us, we’ve been here nearly 400 years.”Plantation villageNewtowncunningham is a Plantation village, founded by a Scottish settler, John Cunningham, who was granted land in the area in the 17th century. About 10km from Derry, it is one of a number of settlements in east Donegal, such as Raphoe and Convoy, which are noted for their significant Protestant minority. The population of Donegal as a whole is 85 per cent Catholic while Protestant denominations make up less than 10 per cent.As such, their identity is multifaceted: “We’re Ulstermen,” says Roulston. “Traditionally, we would have looked at Northern Ireland as the natural place to be – our natural hinterland, if you like.”Yet he is also Irish: “We’re Irish, but we’re part of Ulster, we’re part of the North.”McClean says he is British, and has a UK passport. “I’m a unionist, I believe the union between Britain and Ireland should never have been done away with.“The former president, Mary McAleese, said you could be Irish and Orange,” says Roulston. “I think we can live in this country and we can be Irish and we can be Orange.”Both feel there are misconceptions about the order.“Whenever you put Orange in front of anything in the Republic of Ireland everyone runs for cover, but when we come here for a meeting, the first thing that’s open is a Bible, and it’s the last thing that’s closed,” Roulston says. “It revolves around faith. We do charitable and other things, but it’s like an extension of a church.”They reject any accusation of sectarianism against the order: “It doesn’t discriminate against anyone,” says Roulston. All you have to do to be a member of the Orange Order is to be a part of “the reformed faith”, he adds.“Everybody in Newtown grew up knowing this was the Orange hall and what it was about,” says McClean, “and that everybody was welcome to come through the door.“But as the population changed during the boom and you had more people moving here from the North it was probably seen in the context of Belfast, or the Troubles, or the Drumcree marches in Portadown, and that has a knock-on effect.“How do people see the Orange? They see the rioter, they see the man standing on top of a police Land Rover, they see the guy who’s drunk and wandering about at the parade on the Twelfth day.“But probably 95 per cent of the Orange are the guy who goes to church on a Sunday, the guy who’s always here at meetings, the guy who helps out if there are a couple of slates needing fixed on the roof.”Newtowncunningham’s new lodge – which opened last year – was part-funded by the Government and supported by Donegal County Council. Even during the rebuilding, McClean says, they received threats that it would be burned down again. “We said, we can rebuild it and do what a lot of others do, which is to turn it into a fortress and have shutters on the windows and only open it when we need it, or we can do something different.”Instead, the lodge applied for funding for a peace impact project run by McClean, its purpose is to integrate the hall back into the community.The yoga classes are part of this process so too are pilates sessions, Spanish lessons, and history lectures.“It’s about making this building into a place that is actually used by everybody,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946982.1562268548!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"price of docklands progress a costly one for local residents","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘If my father was dropped down here tomorrow he would not know where he was. This could be Brazil for all he’d know.’ Over the last 25 years, Dublin’s docklands have expanded upwards and outwards to attract and accommodate some 40,000 workers. Beneath the cranes and skyscrapers sits a row of petite Victorian terraced houses. Retiree Tommy Byrne has lived on Mayor Street Upper, once a quiet cul-de-sac, for more than 40 years. He says that for much of that time, he and his neighbours have been “under constant siege” from development. “I am not here to stop progression but they have turned this into a rat run,” he says. By midday, Byrne’s living room is in darkness as a result of all that has been built up around him. He says his utility bills have spiked as lights and heating are needed throughout the day for much of the year. He is reluctant to open his windows as dust sweeps in from the building sites.“Look at that dust. That’s not even on a bad day,” says Byrne after running his finger along the windowsill. Byrne (71) says he is too old to uproot the life he has carved out in the docklands. “If someone had told me 20 years ago this would still be going on now I would have gone,” he says. “I have worked all my life, and now I am living in this dark, clammy, cold house.”The area has lost its community feel, he says, as locals moved on, green space was snapped up and pubs were bought out. The flashy bars and restaurants of the docklands do not interest Byrne, who pines for a “good, local pub”.“I would have to remortgage my house to buy a pint in this area,” he adds. Sitting in his front garden on the corner of Guild Street, Declan Decko Byrne says “anyone who is not wearing a suit will know who I am”. A dock worker’s son, Byrne (57) was born and reared in the docklands “back when it was a slum”. The neighbourhood is unrecognisable now. “If my father was dropped down here tomorrow he would not know where he was. This could be Brazil for all he’d know.”He says those born locally, many living in council houses, have not felt the benefits of the area changing. “It feels like a dumping ground.

Photograph: Sam Boal  RollingNews.ieSaying his timing had “not been great” hours ahead of a meeting with church leaders, he said: “I have offended a lot of people who I never intended to offend. I am sorry for that, I do apologise.”Before he made his apology at Dublin Castle, just ahead of a scheduled meeting with leaders of churches and ethical organisations, Mr Varadkar was seen talking to Archbishop Diarmuid Martin.Responding, Fr Brendan Hoban, the co-founder of the Association of Catholic Priests wondered if Mr Varadkar would have said such a thing about a Church of Ireland minister.‘Hurtful’ Describing the remarks as “very hurtful”, the bishop of Waterford and Lismore, Alphonsus Cullinan, said the vast majority of priests work “so hard” and ordinary people had been “deeply offended”.In the Seanad, Independent Senator Ronan Mullen said it was unacceptable for the Taoiseach to make a “mocking, stigmatising” comment about clergy in the fashion he had.“I need hardly say that if someone made a similarly stigmatising throwaway remark about gay community leaders or spokespersons for the Traveller Community they would be rightly criticised.”‘Not acceptable’Echoing the criticism, Fine Gael senator John O’Mahony said that while “criminal acts” by priests needed “to be weeded out”, painting “everyone with the one brush is not acceptable”.Independent TD Mattie McGrath described Mr Varadkar’s remarks as “utterly revolting” and “outrageous”, while Fianna Fáil Waterford TD Mary Butler said it was “simply unacceptable” that he “denigrates the entire Catholic Church”. Tolerance is needed, she said: “Unfortunately there was no such tolerance or respect shown for the Catholic religion in the Dáil yesterday,” by the Taoiseach when he made those comments.On Thursday night, Mr Martin, responded to the apology and said: “The tone of debate wasn’t bitter or personal. I was asking him about an over run on costs of Dunkettle Interchange Project.”In the Dáil on Thursday, Mr Varadkar said he was “always amused and bemused that Deputy Martin likes to accuse me of being partisan and personal”, yet he was “ very capable of being partisan and personalised himself”.Continuing, he said: “He kind of reminds me of one of those parish priests who preaches from the altar telling us how to avoid sin while secretly going behind the altar and engaging in any amount of sin himself.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946978.1562267845!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hogan rejects inaccurate criticism of eu mercosur deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t European Commissioner for Agriculture Phil Hogan says the Mercosur countries have committed to implement the Paris global warning agreement. File photograph: Nick Bradshaw European Union agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan has rejected criticism of the EULatin American Mercusor trade deal, saying critics are exploiting environmental concerns to block efforts to boost free trade.The agreement, which if ratified will allow Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to export 99,000 tonnes of beef annually to the European Union, has been fiercely opposed by farming organisations. Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed has said that the Government can use environmental concerns to “thwart” the deal, but the Government’s official position is that it will examine the deal before deciding on its position.The central core of the Mercosur agreement is “that trade should not happen at the expense of the environment or labour conditions: on the contrary, it should promote sustainable development,” says the Fine Gael former minister.He says the Mercosur countries have committed to implement the Paris global warning agreement, while Brazil has included specific commitments on preventing deforestation of the Amazon.Opposition parties and farming organisations kept up their criticisms of the agreement. In the Dáil, Fianna Fail’s deputy leader Dara Calleary said that the deal “goes against all of the principles, beliefs and declarations relating to climate change”.“It will sound the death knell for Irish beef and severely damage the Irish poultry sector,” he said.Mr Calleary said that the Brazilian government was “clearing rainforests at a rate of knots in order to make room for cattle which will be sold as part of this deal. ‘Team Ireland’Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty appealed to other parties to be on “Team Ireland” and work with the Government to “get a better result and a better transposition of what is a headline agreement into the legal text”.She said that Mr Hogan was part of Ireland’s “skilled negotiating team in Europe”, though all European commissioners take an oath to be independent of their own countries.Meanwhile, the Government spokesman has indicated that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar does not intend to bring forward any nomination to the European Commission in the immediate future.Opposition politicians – and some Fine Gael TDs – have been critical of Mr Hogan for his defence of the Mercosur deal, and have suggested that Mr Hogan should not be reappointed for a second term.The belief in Brussels, however, is that Mr Hogan is likely to be appointed to the commission where he would be expected to receive a senior portfolio.His name has been linked to the trade commissioner’s job, which would be of particular relevance to Ireland, given that a trade deal with the UK is likely to be negotiated over the coming years once Brexit happens."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946776.1562255231!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government welcomes good bits of mercosur beef deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe multi-sector deal includes provision for the import into the EU of 99,000 tonnes of beef from Argentina.

File photograph: Robert PrattaReutersThe Government has rejected opposition claims that it is sending “incredibly mixed signals” in its response to the EU Mercosur trade agreement over its impact on the Irish beef sector.Minister for Employment Affairs Regina Doherty insisted the Government has been consistent in its message on the deal.“We welcome the good bits,” of the deal she said and they would work “to negate the bad bits” of the agreement, which she stressed was only the start of a long process.She insisted that all Government Ministers were playing on “Team Ireland”.Ms Doherty in turn accused Fianna Fáil deputy leader Dara Calleary of “playing the man” when he asked if Ireland’s EU Commissioner Phil Hogan was on Team Ireland of if he was the “cheerleader” for the deal.The multi-sector deal includes provision for the import into the EU of 99,000 tonnes of beef from Argentina. Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, as well as poultry and pig meat.Mr Calleary again accused the Government of “rewarding climate deniers” and said South American meat would not meet the high standards of Irish product which cost more.Mr Calleary claimed there were “incredibly mixed signals coming from Government”. The deal was signed without any environmental analysis and Mr Hogan was saying that every country should do its own environmental analysis, he said.Amid internal Fine Gael grumblings about Mr Hogan’s future as EU Commissioner, Mr Calleary accused Government Ministers of trying to “make a scapegoat” of Mr Hogan over the failure to protect the beef sector.He said there were “more Fine Gael tanks being placed on Commissioner Hogan’s lawn than in Washington” in reference to the US July 4th military display.Ms Doherty said the Government was consistent in its message and would defend all Irish farmers.She told Mr Calleary “you are playing the man rather than dealing with the issue”.She said that the deal, which took 20 years to agree, was only at the start of a long process of finalisation.She also said that Mr Hogan, a former Fine Gael cabinet minister, would have a role in that process in the coming years."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3946957.1562271182!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us vice president mike pence to visit ireland in september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and his partner Matt Barrett with US vice-president Mike Pence and his sister Anne Pence Poynter at the vice-president’s official residence in Washington DC in March. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireUS vice-president Mike Pence is to visit Ireland in September, his first trip here in an official capacity.Mr Pence, who has family roots in Ireland, is expected to arrive for a three-day visit during the first week of September. Official contacts have been underway between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the office of the vice-president in Washington in recent weeks.It is expected Mr Pence will visit Dublin, Cork and Shannon. A meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to take place, while an engagement with President Michael D Higgins is under consideration. Mr Pence, a former governor of Indiana, was chosen by Donald Trump to become his running-mate in July 2016. In January 2017 he was sworn-in as vice president. Mr Pence’s maternal grandfather emigrated from Tubbercurry, Co Sligo in the 1920s, settling in Chicago. He also has family connections in Doonbeg, Co Clare. Mr Pence, an evangelical Christian who is well-known for his opposition to gay marriage, hosted Mr Varadkar and his partner Matt for the traditional St Patrick’s Day breakfast in Washington in March. Mr Varadkar extended an invitation to Mr Pence to visit Ireland. It is understood Mr Pence will be accompanied by his wife and members of his extended family.He will be the latest senior US politician to visit Ireland this year. In June,Mr Trump visited Doonbeg, meeting the Taoiseach at Shannon Airport. Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, led a congressional delegation to Dublin and Northern Ireland in April. During his St Patrick’s Day meeting with Mr Pence, Mr Varadkar said he was honoured to accept his invitation. “I stand here this morning as leader of my country, flawed and human, but judged by my political actions and not by my sexual orientation or my skin tone or my gender or religious beliefs.“And I don’t believe my country is the only one in the world where this story is possible. “It is found in every country where freedom and liberty are cherished. We are after all, all God’s children.” Mr Pence has visited Ireland several times and has spoken publicly about his love for Ireland. In March 2016, shortly after his swearing-in as vice president, he was honoured by the Ireland Funds at the organisation’s annual gala dinner in Washington, which was attended by then Taoiseach Enda Kenny. He described how he thought about his grandfather Richard Michael Cawley arriving in Ellis Island in 1923 on the day he was inaugurated as vice-president.“I just keep thinking of that day in April 1923 when Richard Michael Cawley stepped off the boat in Ellis Island. I can’t imagine what the sight of the statue of liberty meant to him that day. The torch of freedom,” he said.“All the I am, all that I will ever be and all the service that I will ever give is owed to my Irish heritage.”Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

Residents had barricaded themselves into their homes, according to Ansa, Italy’s national news agency.  The fire brigade commander of the Sicilian city of Messina confirmed the casualties to La Repubblica. The hiker who was killed was later named as Massimo Imbesi, 35, from Sicily. The injured man was from Brazil.There was a series of violent explosions from the crater of the volcano, which dominates the island. The ash cloud enveloped the island of StromboliFiona Carter, a British tourist on the neighbouring island of Panarea, which lies about 17 miles from Stromboli, heard the eruption.We turned around to see a mushroom cloud coming from Stromboli. Everyone was in shock. Then red hot lava started running down the mountain towards the little village of Ginostra, she told Reuters.The cloud got bigger, white and grey. It enveloped Ginostra and now the cloud has covered Stromboli entirely.”We saw the explosion from the hotel. There was a loud roar, said Michela Favorito, who works in a hotel near Fico Grande, on the east side of the island.Two new lava spouts were creeping down the volcanoWe plugged our ears and after this a cloud of ash swept over us. The whole sky is full of ash, a fairly large cloud, she said.Emergency worker Calogero Foti told RAI television: Unfortunately one man is dead, there are a few injured, but none seriously.Firefighters were being deployed from nearby islands and a Canadair water-bombing aircraft was also sent.Stefano Branca, from  the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology, told Reuters there had been a paroxysmal eruption on the island, when high-pressure magma explodes from a shallow, underground reservoir. These are events of great intensity and quite rare, he said.Tourists watch the eruption of the volcano from a neighbouring island Tourists are drawn to its crystal clear waters, black sand beaches and the chance to climb the 3,000ft-high summit of the volcano.“I’ve never felt so much fear in my life,” one visitor wrote on Twitter, posting a photograph of the sides of the volcano on fire. Another tourist wrote: “Panic and chaos among the people present on the island.

Mr Isaac was speaking at the launch of a report by the think-tank Theos about faith on campus. “We are living in an age of hypersensitivity where it is increasingly easier for people to feel offended - or others to be worried about protecting minority groups,” he said.  Last year, a pro-life student group was refused permission to set up stalls at three different university freshers’ fairs.The charity, called Life, wrote to the independent regulator of higher education in England to express concern about discriminatory behaviour and freedom of expression violations… by a number of university student unions. In 2017, an Oxford College banned the Christian Union from its freshers’ fair on the grounds that it would be “alienating” for students of other religions, and constitute a “micro-aggression”. The organiser of Balliol’s fair argued Christianity’s historic use as “an excuse for homophobia and certain forms of neo-colonialism” meant that students might feel “unwelcome” in their new college if the Christian Union had a stall.At the time,  the vice-president of Balliol’s Junior Common Room (JCR) committee, said that if a representative from the Christian Union attended the fair, it could cause potential harm to freshers.  Donald Trump hails America\u0026#39s military might in July 4 speech amid pomp and flyoversIran blasts Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39piracy\u0026#39 after Royal Marines detain oil tanker in GibraltarCommon cold virus could cure cancer, pioneering trial suggests Regulators urged to act as investigation reveals Amazon sellers using hacked accounts to post five-star reviews“Worryingly high” number of people infected with latent form of drug resistant TB Sarah Payne: The Untold Story, review - this retelling brought tears, but no catharsisBoris Johnson: I will make Britain the greatest place on EarthComment: By taking us out on time, Boris will jumpstart a trade deal with our friends in America Jeremy Hunt proposes tax breaks for families prepared to look after their elderly relatives at homeNetflix to introduce smoking warnings to its ratings system Comment: Ousting Jeremy Corbyn now would spell catastrophe for LabourCharity whistleblowing surges in wake of Oxfam scandal, charity commission saysChurch of England will condone gay couples for the first time, as long as they were man and wife when they took their vowsFormer teacher becomes sixth person to be jailed for pupil sex assault at top private schoolSouthern California struck by 6.4 magnitude earthquakeSerengeti, episode 1, review: Simon Fuller\u0026#39s nature series looks amazing but is bizarrely childishDutch Heineken kidnapper jailed for life for gangland murdersBrexit chaos and poor road quality cause M20 to be voted least satisfactory motorway in England King\u0026#39s College London says sorry for banning students from campus during royal visitComment: What exciting new promises will Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt come out with next?Comment: The EU\u0026#39s new \u0026#39dream team\u0026#39 stand us proof that Brexiteers are on the right side of historyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal marines gibraltar detains supertanker suspected delivering","story":"Defence and Security CorrespondentBritain has been plunged into a diplomatic row with Iran after Royal Marines seized an Iranian oil tanker as it passed through the Strait of Gibraltar, in a move likely to further inflame tensions in the Gulf. The Grace 1 super-tanker was boarded in the early hours of Thursday morning to prevent it from delivering a cargo of crude oil to Syria in defiance of EU sanctions, apparently following a request to the UK from the United States.  The move provoked fury in Iran, which accused Britain of bowing to US pressure to blockade its oil exports and summoned the British ambassador to the foreign ministry in Tehran to express its very strong objection to the illegal and unacceptable seizure of the 300 meter vessel. Abbas Moussavi, a spokesman, called the move destructive and said it could increase tensions in the Persian Gulf, where six oil tankers have recently suffered attacks that Britain and the US have blamed on Iran.In an interview on Iranian television, Mr Mousavi said it was a form of piracy that proved Britain was following the hostile policies of the US.US National Security Advisor John Bolton said the British move was excellent news.America \u0026amp our allies will continue to prevent regimes in Tehran \u0026amp Damascus from profiting off this illicit trade, Bolton said on Twitter.The drama began when a specialist team from the Royal Marines’ Maritime Operations Unit swooped on the 330 meter super-tanker as it paused to take on supplies off Gibraltar overnight. The 30 commandos inserted on a Pacific 24 high-speed boat and by ‘fast-roping’ from a Wildcat helicopter, allowing 16 Royal Gibraltar Police officers to search the vessel in a safe manner. The operation was over in minutes with no shots fired. Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar\u0027s Chief Minister, said he authorised the assault and a police request for Royal Marine assistance because he believed the ship was bound for the Baniyas refinery in Syria.  That refinery is the property of an entity that is subject to European Union sanctions against Syria, he said. The foreign minister of Spain said Britain had acted as the request of the United States. Josep Borrell, the Spanish foreign minister, said Madrid was assessing the implications of the incident because it took place in waters it considers its own. Spain disputes British ownership of Gibraltar. The Foreign Office said Rob Macaire, the UK ambassador in Tehran, told the foreign ministry when he was summoned that the move was about enforcing sanctions on Syria, not on Iran, and that Britain views Iranian oil exports in general as legitimate.   Gibraltarian police and customs and a detachment of Royal Marines halted the vesselLloyd\u0027s List, the shipping publication, said the 300,000-tonne, Panamanian-flagged tanker loaded oil off Iran in April before sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, a lengthy route apparently taken because the ship was too heavy to use the Suez canal. The vessel was one of four tankers found to be involved in shipping Iranian fuel oil to Singapore and China in violation of US sanctions by a Reuters investigation earlier this year.Its seizure will further inflame the difficult relationship between Britain and Tehran, which regularly clash over Iran\u0027s foreign policy and the fate of jailed British dual nationals including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.   It may also complicate British, French, and German efforts to save the 2015 nuclear deal and to defuse a confrontation between the United States and Iran in the Gulf.Hassan Rouhani, Iran\u0027s president, said on Sunday that Tehran will increase its enrichment of uranium to any amount that we want after it breached the 300 kilogram limit laid out in the nuclear agreement in protest at US attempts to strangle its oil exports. The Panamanian-flagged Grace 1 is thought to be carrying oil from IranBritain officially defends Iran\u0027s right to export oil under the 2015 nuclear deal, which offered the Islamic Republic economic incentives in exchange for curtailing its nuclear program.  But the United States, which quit the deal last year, has attempted to blockade Iranian oil exports under a maximum pressure policy designed to force Tehran to accept more restrictive limits on its nuclear program, curtail its ballistic missile program and abandon covert military operations in the Middle East. The policy has reduced Iran\u0027s exports to well below 500,000 barrels of oil a day, a fraction of the 1.8 million economists believe the country needs to operate. Iran has said it will continue to breach some of its nuclear commitments unless the remaining signatories of the deal - Britain, France, Germany, the EU, Russia, and China - find a way for it to sell oil and access the revenues. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Widdecombe’s comments trivialise the suffering of those who have experienced slavery and colonialism,” he told The Independent after the speech.“If Ann Widdecombe had any grip on reality, she would have the sense to look at her own record on oppressing women and minorities when she defended shackling pregnant women and opposed repealing Section 28.

At worst, you’re Love Island’s head of Human Resources.What the ITV show really needs you to be, though, is the one thing you’re very obviously not — a host.Or just someone with enough wit and presence to draw attention away from the feeling I’ve had, ever since the th minute of the opening show, that this series of Love Island isn’t working.That was the moment Lucie arrived at the villa with a list of her own pre- prepared catchphrases. The public, I’d imagine, hated the presumption, but it was hardly unique to her.There’s an air of calculation and entitlement about most of this year’s contestants who, five series into its le, appear to have worked out what does and doesn’t play well with the public and are just killing time by the pool until they cash in on their performance afterwards.This doesn’t do much for the spontaneity of Love Island or the catchphrases which seem to have been replaced by those insanely annoying verbal tics that make the rest of us want to throttle everyone under the age of .Elma on Maura: “The bird has, like, ­literally lost her s**t.” Molly-Mae on Lucie: “I’ve, like, literally had her back in here.”Joe to Lucie: “You’re, like, literally a ­unicorn.” She’s, like, literally not.I think I could live with the bombardment of likes and literallys, though,it wasn’t for the overriding problem with this bunch, compared to previous series.They’re not very nice.In fact there’s a particularly ­indignant and gossipy bunch, centred round Anna, Amy, Molly-Mae and Amber and a couple of weaselly blokes , who are prepared to do their dirty work, that have given it a really unpleasant atmosphere a lot of the time.This has a knock-on effect, obviously.For the first four years, Iain Stirling’s commentary was the show’s outstanding feature.This series, it’s as manic as ever, but so flat and repetitive I’m starting to wonderI imagined the previous triumphs.This is by no means his fault. The deaths of two former contestants before the series began had already put it under huge scrutiny, and the spin-off seems to be that a small-yet-noisy chunk of the audience are now Love Island vigilantes who think it’s their duty to bombard Ofcom with complaints about anything, but mostly nothing.A great shame, as I genuinely love this show, which is normally the funniest and most ­gloriously un-PC event of the year.It still has its moments, of course.

There were busloads of them.Yet, with the honourable exception of Mark Radclfe, who’s a great broadcaster, the usual rules of presenting were suspended at Glastonbury.None of them were presentable, for a start.Genuine laughs were non-existent and nearly all critical faculties had been left at home, so they couldn’t even point out “s children’s TV presenter” wasn’t a good look for Tim Burgess, of The Charlatans, let alone hint that maybe Stormzy hadn’t had enough big hits to headline the Pyramid Stage.You’d imagine, then, that they all brought a breadth of knowledge and inside information that would illuminate the valley like , cigarette lighters being flipped on for a final encore.Jo Whiley: “Do you have any idea who might be coming out on stage with Stormzy ”Huw Stephens: “I have no idea.”But you’d imagine wrong.MEANWHILE, on recent episodes of ­EastEnders, the emaciated remains of Louise Mitchell have been found inside a shipping ­container that washed up in the Crimea, Keanu’s died after being tied to a chair and shoved off a tall building by Sharon, and new love interest Adrian Edmonson reacted to being doused in water by battering Jean Slater ­repeatedly round the head with a ­rubber frying pan and jabbing a fork into her ­buttocks.Not in broadcast episodes, obviously.

Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Blame it on the fact I’ve just spent the last hour on a bloody exercise bike, trying to shed the burgeoning pounds around my gut.But it’s true, nonetheless — or partly true, at least. One third of Britons are obese. You may have noticed them waddling up the high street, gasping with exertion, curtains of lard hanging down from their arms.Worse still, obesity is now officially a bigger killer than smoking. Being overweight is now the chief cause of four really horrible cancers — oian, bowel, liver and kidney. The full English.We’ve known about this obesity epidemic for a long time now. But we’ve gone about dealing with it in entirely the wrong way.First, the ious charities have told us it’s terribly wrong to fat shame people. It might hurt their self-esteem. Well, good.Shaming works. It was when my son called me a “lard-faced tw*t” during an argument that I decided I needed to do some serious weight-loss stuff. Hence the exercise bike.But we’ve also concentrated — quite wrongly — on diet. And when we do that we end up penalising the very poorest in society. Every week there are calls to raise the price of cheap alcohol, sugary drinks, fast food, any stuff with sugar in it. This is called a “sin tax” and it always hurts the working class. They won’t be putting a tax on Chablis, will they Boris Johnson has just announced that he wants to do away with these sin taxes. It’s the first thing he’s said in ages that I agree with.Start with cigarettes, Boris. But also stop persecuting people who occasionally eat a cheeseburger from McDonald’s.That’s not the real cause of obesity. The real cause is lack of exercise. We live increasingly sedentary lives. We don’t walk enough, we don’t play sport. We sit at desks and fester. This is bad enough for the adult population. But it’s even worse for the kids.Our schoolchildren get less exercise than ever before. When they are at school, the PE lessons are fewer than was once the case. And competitiveness is frowned upon by the leftie teachers.Further, over the years, thousands of acres of school playing fields have been sold off for housing developments. So the kids have nowhere to play competitive games, eventhey were allowed to.And out of school, of course, they are not kicking a ball around, or going on walks. They are instead glued to their bloody electronic devices. Sat on their fat ar*es hammering away at some internet game. Living their lives vicariously instead of in the real world.And they are ferried everywhere by their mums and dads — instead of doing what we did as kids and walk everywhere.That’s the problem, almost the only problem. We don’t have worse diets than I had when I was a kid. Crispy pancakes filled with salty gloop and frozen pizzas that tasted like your sofa Today’s diet is no worse than that stuff. And very few of us were fat then.Somehow we need to convince kids that it’s important to get out and exercise a bit. And parents need to let their kids off the leash a little more. Get them to walk to places.Take their devices off them and kick them out of the house. Impress upon them that legs are useful things and might be funthey employed them once in a while.And for the rest of us: Walk, run, cycle. , paces per day minimum, or you’ll end up like Jabba The Hutt.

And I’m going to swing by and take a dump in your garden and decapitate a thrush.There are few more selfish people than cat owners. If you can’t keep your cat confined on your own property, don’t have a cat.And isn’t it about time we started fining cat owners when they fail to pick up after their pet has defecated AS you probably gathered, I don’t have too much time for Jeremy Corbyn.He’s a dimbo who buys all the adolescent, far-left stupidity. Policies which were dated decades ago.But I am totally on his side when it comes to his battle with the civil service. Someone within that smug organisation leaked an official “worry” that Corbyn was “too frail” to carry outThat was cruel, spiteful and politically motivated.The civil service is against Corbyn because they don’t agree with his policies. Well, me neither. But the civil service is there to carry out the bidding of WHOEVER we elect, even Magic Grandpa.The problem is that the civil service is heavily biased, just like the BBC. Not so much to the left as towards the liberal viewpoint on all things.We saw this during the Brexit negotiations, when one civil servant broke cover and told The Sunday Times that the entire civil service was against Brexit and did its best to undermine it.We need a clear out of these time servers, cocooned in their middle-class bubble.HERE’S Alex Morgan, scorer of the goal which knocked our Lionesses out of the World Cup.She annoyed people by miming the act of drinking tea.

I did once come across a good one on  the Channel Island of Sark but that’s about as far afield as the genre works.Spaniards, for a communal knees-up, will hold an evening fiesta with castanet-clacking, flamenco dancers and lots of shouts of: “Ole!”Scandinavians, in their few moments of fervour, will dance around apple trees, drink aquavit and jump into the nearest lake wearing their birthday suits.Germans obey the summons of an oompah band and will sit in orderly rows at long tables to eat cake and take the pils. The French play boules in dusty town squares. Icelandics bubble in boiling mud baths. Swiss yodel. Italians sing. And Russians sunbathe standing up, like armies of penguins.Yet we British attend local fêtes or school fairs, to delight ourselves with cheesy games. Do you like whack-a-mole or are you more of an apple bobber, plunging your head into a barrel of cold water to try to bite an elusive Granny Smith Bouncy castles, face-painting, white-elephant stalls, the suggestive-carrots display, guess-the--of-the-sausage-dog or the dreaded bric-a-brac stall: These are the daft indulgences of the British summer. Sophisticated  No. But that’s the whole point. Fêtes are exuberantly shambolic and unsnobby.You’ll find them in country and urban districts alike, from the Isle of Wight to Inverness. They never wheedle for public money. You won’t ever hear them bragging about their Bame quotas. They just get on with le and are cheerfully self-sufficient and unaffectedly erse.The other weekend a  friend worked the BBQ  at his children’s school in London and reported a joyous snapshot of modern Britain.Lots of women in hijabs played hook-a-duck, spending their cash on halal burgers and cans of pop. It’s not a bad definition of Britishness: Have you ever been to a fête Certain rules apply.RULE ONE: At least one lady on the organising committee shall be called Peggy or Alison.RULE TWO: The trestle tables at the tea stall shall wobble alarmingly, but never quite collapse.RULE THREE: The home-made chocolate eclairs shall start to melt in the cakes tent.RULE FOUR: The PA system operated by the master of ceremoniesshall be prey to random bursts of deafening feedback.RULE FIVE: Evenit rains, everyone will totter home happy.Foreigners often find us hard to understand. At present they are baffled that our Government may soon be led by crumpled, grunting Boris Johnson, and that his opponent will be rambling revolutionary Jeremy Corbyn, an OAP who likes shell-suits and municipal manhole covers.Global diplomats and analysts pore over the socio-economic data, the pollsters’ pie charts, the tax statistics and more, and they puzzle.Likewise, they behold the weekly argy-bargy of Prime Minister’s Questions, or the sight of Nigel Farage and his merry MEPs turning their backs on the EU anthem at the opening of the European Parliament, and they are flummoxed. Brexit bamboozles them — “But why do you wish to leave our European Union ” They really don’t get it.My advice to our foreign friends is this: Follow the bunting and get yourself to a neighbourhood summer beano.Visit a fête and you will soon understand the British character. Bloody-minded,  quirky, unassuming, unfazed about politically-correct crazes.Fêtes are a telling combination of romantic tradition and anarchy. No one wants them to be slickly modern.We want our fêtes to be small-c conservative: The canvas marquee to smell as it did  years ago, the skittles lane to be surrounded by no more health and safety paraphernalia than a few straw bales, and at least one of the domestic-produce judges to become squfy after sampling the home-made sloe gins.At our village in Herefordshire it is always my job to supervise the dog show. In the parade ring things iniably unravel. We have had fights and attempted matings .One year a lad aged  about six entered the ring with a Great Dane twice his size. The dog, naturally, was called Tiny.Another year, in the musical mats competition, a great-gran in her s was so determined to win that she used her walking stick to trip up a teenage rival. We Brits may have an amateurish bent but we are competitive, too. The EU should not overlook that truth.Politicians and quangocrats and the BBC are convinced that the country is in decline and that everyone has some problem or is oppressed by an -ism.A trip to a fête would put them right. Fêtes are optimistic, classless, unpretentious, fun. No race quotas. No safety announcements. No risk assessments. No race or gender angst.They may often look like something from a Richard Curtis film but fêtes are a better reflection of st-century Britain than any state-subsidised art show or any right-on TV soap.See you at the tombola stand. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The only problem is I cant remember what his face looked like, he told ITV News.I dont think I could say a single thing about what he looked like. Isnt that dreadful He was relaxed, he was laid-back, he was amiable. I quite took to him. I was dreading a pretentious arty-farty type, but he was very pleasant.He reacted very well when I made a joke just before the camera was rolling.I said Right, Banksy, what will you doI take thatoff during the interview  and he just laughed, he knew I wasnt meaning it.But I wish I had, because that would have been extremely valuable.Gordon continued: I have no evidence on which to make an assessment on whether this was the real Banksy or not.But it seemed like an organised event. The press officer seemed like a normal press officer who wouldnt be playing a trick on the media.We got the footage of him doing things without a disguise and we had a conversation without the disguise.In his film Exit Through The Gtshop, Banksy is filmed as a hooded silhouette and his voice is distorted.The voice is muffled in the ITV footage, due to the grey T-shirt over his nose and mouth.He wears a blue and white cap and a beige hooded coat.Turf War saw Banksy decorate live farm animals, with sheep painted as blue zebra, cattle with This way up arrows and stencilled blue police patrol car colours on pigs.Its hard to make an entertaining picture at the best of times but at leastyou have something that wanders around and licks its nose and urinates in front of you its going to make the picture a bit more interesting, the interviewee tells Gordon.Asked about spraying Designated Riot Area on Nelsons Column, the man tells the journalist: I thought that was quite funny.Robin GunninghamBristol artist Robin Gunningham was thought to be Banksy after criminologists at London’s Queen Mary University used ‘geographic profiling’ in an attempt to reveal his identity.The technique uses statistical analysis used in police work to locate repeat offenders.The researchers looked for signs of correlation between  artworks in London and Bristol that have been attributed to Bansky, finding stylistic similarities between the two.D – Robert Del NajaDrum and bass star Goldie is thought to have revealed Banksy’s identity as the Massive Attack star known as D in an interview in .The band’s founding member and Goldie have been friends for a long time and were both graffiti artists in the late s.In an interview with spoken word poet Scroobius Pip for a podcast Del Naja said: Give me a bubble letter and put it on a t-shirt and write Banksy on it and were sorted. We can sell it now.No disrespect to Robert, I think he is a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over.Journalist Craig Williams had previously carried out an investigation into Banksy and concluded that Banksy was not just one person but a team of street artists with Del Naja, , as the ringleader.Del Naja has occasionally designed the artwork for Massive Attack’s albums, including ’s Heligoland which featured stencil art not dissimilar to Banksy’s style.Del Naja though as denied the rumour saying it was “greatly exaggerated”.Richard PfeferThe New York spraypainter Pfefer was spotted in front of a mural done by Banksy in March  and was accused of being the famous artist by the cops.Thierry GuettaThe French graffiti artist living in Los Angeles, who is also known as Mr Brainwash, is seen in Banksys documentary Exit Through the Gt Shop.The film tells the story of Guetta and his obsession with documenting his le on film.Some though think Guetta and Banksy are the same person.The notion it is Guetta springs from the idea that the hapless artist was only feigning mediocrity in the film and it was really Banksy hiding in plain sight.Graffiti artist in AustraliaYouTube user Mia S claimed she had caught Banksy in the act after believing she had filmed the artist in Melbourne, Australia.The footage shows a bespectacled man in jeans, a dark jacket, hoodie and a cap.She approaches the graffiti artist before he tells her to “f**k off” and flees the scene.Gordon asks: You dont mindI pass your details on to the police He replies: No. What details have you got Richard Jones is a director of Tangent Books, which has published several books about Banksy and Bristol street art.He described the footage as really unusual and very, very rare.His anonymity is something which is very, very important to him, Mr Jones said.I often wonder what it must be like living your le anonymously.It must be so strange, going through layers of hiding your identity.I wonder how he feels about being the most famous current artist in the world but nobody knowing who he is apart from a small group of people.Banksy has used teams of people to create larger exhibitions such his dystopian theme park Dismaland in Weston-super-Mare in  and Banksy versus Bristol Museum in .It is not known whether he was the sole artist for Turf War.Murphy said the interview showed several things that had not previously been seen in relation to Banksy.Firstly, we have an artist purporting to be Banksy creating art at an official Banksy exhibition, he said.Secondly, this man is interviewed and we see more of his face than we have ever seen before.Thirdly, we hear his voice. It is mumbly and muffled but hes clearly a very funny chap.We simply dont know for surethis is Banksy. But here, for the first - and last - time, is someone put up for interview at an official show.That hasnt happened before or afterwards, which makes this interview and Haigs report so extraordinary and rare.Murphy said that, at other events, Banksy creates the artworks and slips back to the shadows - letting his pieces speak for themselves.He insisted that ITV was not trying to expose Banksy or reveal his real name.What we are saying is There was this event back in , Banksy willingly gave ITV News an interview, he wanted the publicity, its been forgotten, now its found and here it is, Murphy said.People can make up their own minds.A spokeswoman for Banksy declined to comment.The video will be available to watch on ITV News West Countrys digital channels on Thursday evening.It will be broadcast on ITV New West Country at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"california earthquake los angeles las vegas","story":"The .-magnitude epicentre was reported near Searles Valley, according to the US Geological Survey .Buildings were rocked and some roads were left badly damaged as the quake triggered dozens of emergency calls.The town of Ridgecrest -  miles from the epicentre - saw some building fires break out as it suffered the worst of the damage.Residents in Las Vegas, some  miles from Los Angeles, shared footage of lamps shaking in their homes, as the quake struck.Aftershocks measuring ., ., . and . were recorded, according to officials.The quakes centre occurred in a remote area, some  miles from the centre of Los Angeles, around five miles underground.US actress Lucy Hale tweeted: I know everyone’s tweeting about this LA earthquake but that s*** was super long.

Funding the scheme in its current form would cost the BBC around £m a year.Earlier this week, BBC Chairman Sir David Clementi said the BBC had never delivered funding for the ver- scheme and it is the Government thats ending the funding.He added that cutting the pay of stars would not be able to fund the cost of the scheme.Boris also used the event today to slam internet giants like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google for paying virtually nothing in tax.If he gets into No he promised he would find a way to tax them on their incomes to level the playing field, he added.Its simply uneven, simply unfair, he said.He also revealed he would consider cutting corporation tax too as a way of trying to boost the economy.You can continue to cut and still produce more economic growth, he insisted.Look at America, theyve had a big programme of tax allowances, growth is at . per cent, and money is coming in.The Brexiteer front-runner came under fire for promising income tax cuts for the wealthy, but Boris insisted he wanted to encourage businesses.He blasted business rates as crippling and said he would cut them to help the struggling high street.He would use the £billion orce bill to help fund his spending pledgeswe left without a deal, he vowed.Boris also said the Tories had to get ready for an election and promised to knock Jeremy Corbyn out of the park.He would be a catastrophe for our country.

We need to get a move on.Decent-minded voters are being pushed towards extremes like Jeremy Corbyn and the Brexit party because mainstream politicians have failed so far to deliver.Abroad, I see the whole time as ­Foreign Secretary the way that other countries look at us and wonder what on earth is going on.So more than anything  the choice in this leadership contest is about who can deliver Brexit.It’s not about the best soundbite, or speech, or piece of rhetoric. But about who can actually deliver.What we need is a negotiator. Someone who has taken risks to start up their own business. Someone with trusted relationships across Europe that can be used to get a better deal. I believe I am that person.Others may have promised £million for the NHS on the side of a bus, but I was the Health Secretary who negotiated with a tight-fisted Treasury to actually deliver it. I can do the same to deliver Brexit.And I’ve got the plan to do it. If we ramp up No Deal preparations we can show Brussels we are serious in our intent.And with a new negotiating team we can get the changes needed to get a deal that the country should support.With the right person in charge we can get out and get out quickly.Once we have Brexit done we can start focusing on the big challenges that affect our lives:First, how do we turbocharge our economy  When I was in my twenties I started my own tech business which I grew until it employed hundreds of people.I know what it takes to get the mojo back in our economy.It means cutting corporation tax to Irish levels and slashing business rates so that  per cent of high street shops do not have to pay them.If we get it right we can park an ­economic jumbo jet off the coast of Europe and ensure that in the trade negotiations they need us every bit as much as we need them.Second, how do we stop the threat of Corbyn and show young people they can trust the Conservative Party again Jeremy Corbyn is the most left-wing, anti-British Labour leader in history.He represents a threat to millions of jobs and would damage our security. But at the last election millions of young people were tempted to take the risk. Why  Because the most basic part of human dignity is having somewhere decent to live. For too many young people that’s just too hard.People of my generation found buying a house straightforward. Since then house prices have ballooned but average incomes have not.It’s left a generational ide between young and old that is as bad as any ide created by the Referendum. So we have to have a plan to make buying a house more affordable for young people.Margaret Thatcher had a policy called ‘Right to Buy’ that got millions on to the housing ladder for the first time.Mine is called ‘Right to Own’ and it will do the same. I will take advantage of the massive leap in land value that comes from councils granting planning permission by ensuring the benefit of it goes directly to young people, rather than into the pockets of developers.Combined with new planning regulations to allow people to build up, with more storeys on top of apartment blocks, this will deliver the new homes we need.In total my plan will deliver . million more homes in ten years — giving a whole generation a leg up on to the housing ladder.It will give them the dignity and the security of a home they can call their own. That’s the best way to win the next generation — showing them that it’s the Conservative Party that has the practical solutions to the problems they face. Where Corbyn talks, Conservatives do.Third, we need to have a plan to get Britain standing tall in the world again.Nothing has given me more pride than to represent Britain abroad as Foreign Secretary. But while Brexit should be a moment for us to step up in the world, the way we’ve handled it has left the rest of the world scratching their heads. Britain deserves better.My dad was in the Navy. It was his generation that won the Cold War without firing a shot.They did that because we won the battle of ideas. But also because the USSR knew we were ready to defend ourselves. So as Britain enters a new chapter in its history, I want to equip us for a new role.We’re a world leader in soft power — our media, our culture and our universities, but I want our hard power to match that.So I will back our brave troops with a major boost to our defence spending, giving them the resources they need to do the job we ask of them. By raising defence spending from  per cent to . per cent we can afford the kit and capabilities to face new battles against new enemies.But more than that, showing the world that, just as our parents’ generation stood tall in the Cold War, Britain will always be there to defend and protect those values. This, then, is my plan for Britain: get Brexit done, stop Corbyn, build more homes, and get us standing tall in the world.Deliver it and we can take advantage of the amazing opportunities this country has.The best universities in the world. The most exciting companies. The world’s language and can-do people that have changed history.It’s a plan to bring people together and deliver Brexit.Back it and we can unite as a country and win again.He would slash business taxes to boost the economy and create jobs. He would raise defence spending substantially.Crucially he has a plan to build .million homes. That is what’s needed to deliver the Tory property-owning dream to millennials priced out of the market.Mr Hunt is an excellent Foreign Secretary and could make a good PM. He is decent, thoughtful and steered the NHS with admirable resolve through hard times against a barrage of leftie hate.But he has a mountain to climb to beat Boris Johnson. The fox-hunting blunder won’t help.

Now she has a second book and an apprentice moggie is working at the station because Felix is so busy.Station manager Andy Croughan says: “People like cats and Felix happened to catch the moment. A colleague posted the high-vis picture of her and after that it was chaos.“The followers on her page shot up to , and on the back of it came press and charity work.”Felix now enjoys a Facebook following of ,, with fans flocking from around the globe to catch a glimpse of her.With the social media fame came a book offer from Penguin and writer Kate Moore took  up residence at the station to get the lowdown on the popular pussy.Andy says: “Kate interviewed us all for about three hours. She came on night shts to see Felix in her element — she comes alive at night.”Felix became the country’s most in-demand moggy after the success of the first biography.Andy says: “We weren’t used to all these TV crews wanting to come and chat about the cat. It was surreal. She’s done CBeebies, The One Show has come to meet her and she’s done Good Morning Britain.“Sky Sport’s Jeff Stelling came up during his charity walk for Prostate Cancer UK. She was a bit tetchy that day and he wanted a photo with her but she went for him.”All the proceeds from the first book went to Prostate Cancer UK. Felix has also raised money for numerous other charities — even participating in a k sponsored walk.Andy says: “She wore a GPS tracker for the walk. The money raised went to Fairy Bricks which donates Lego sets to children’s hospices and hospitals. The charity donated a le-size Lego model of Felix, which we keep in a display.”That has become a shrine to Felix in the ticket office. Next to the Lego model is the board from the Huddersfield Monopoly game, which features the local four-legged legend, her books printed in several languages, and letters from fans.Felix’s wispy black fur with white bib and socks has caught the eye of commuters ever since TransPennine Express railway company recruited the eight-week-old kitten as a “pest controller” in .But it is her compassion which has made the moggy the treasured station cat she is today. With a nose for sadness, Felix has comforted colleagues and commuters going through tough times. When the first book was being written, veteran station supervisor Billy Bolt passed away.And in , when Kate was researching the second book, the station staff lost another colleague, Karl. Felix was a great support to station staff in both cases. Kate wrote: “The cat has an extraordinary sixth sense for people’s vulnerability.“When Billy Bolt had died, it was Felix who comforted his colleagues . . .  Karl may have gone, but Felix could still care for the friends he had loved.”Felix has also been a calming influence on autistic kids whose parents brought them to meet her. And she brought solace to a terminally ill lady named Gloria, who got in touch on Felix’s Facebook page.Meeting the cat was on her bucket list after doctors told her she could only receive palliative care for pulmonary fibrosis.Kate writes in the second book: “There was an instant and deep connection between the two . . . It was as though Felix sensed that Gloria was dferent from her other visitors.”And it’s not just here that Felix is a hit. Fans from Kazakhstan, Canada, New Zealand and Australia have flown to see her.Each year Felix poses for a charity calendar which is sold in the station and, like every savvy celeb, she has her own line of merchandise.Andy says: “We have had postcards made and at Christmas we’ve done baubles or keyrings. All for charity.”And after all these years in the spotlight, Felix is now a pro at dealing with the paparazzi.Andy says: “This morning she was posing for the photographer whereas right at the beginning we’d have been chasing her around the station.

In a desperate attempt to appeal to Conservative grassroots, the Foreign Secretary voiced his support for the cruel sport which has been banned for nearly  years. He vowed to support a vote in Parliament when there was a majority in the Commons likely to back the move. “I think we have to recognise it’s part of the countryside and I think we have to recognise that, in terms of the balance of the countryside, it’s part of our heritage,” he told the . “So personally I’m happy for people to do it.” The plot triggered a vicious backlash, forcing wounded Mr Hunt to try and repair the damage as it risked derailing his dream of becoming Prime Minister.    In a car-crash BBC radio interview, the out-of-touch multimillionaire was asked four times whether hunting was cruel, but dodged answering. “The law is not going to change on fox hunting,” said the MP for South West Surrey. “There isn’t a majority in the House of Commons and I don’t see there ever being one. “I was just restating the position in our manesto from  that there should be a free voteit ever looked like that majority would change. Theresa May ’s confession to the Mirror during the snap general election two years ago that she had always backed the rural past-time was widely blamed for fuelling her ballot box humiliation. The Mirror Fox protested outside Tory leadership hustings in York tonight as furious Conservative MPs joined the backlash. Wales Office Minister Kevin Foster said on Twitter : “There is no chance of such a majority for this cruel  long banned activity to come back. Time to move on with animal welfare gains, not go back decades.” Senior backbencher Julian Knight blasted Mr Hunt for raising “some guff about fox hunting”. League Against Cruel Sports director of campaigns Chris Luffingham said: “The last time a politician said we should bring back hunting - Theresa May in the  general election – they were punished in the polling booths. “Nothing has changed. The vast majority of the British public will be horried by any attempt to revert back to the barbaric activity of fox hunting.”    He added: “Millions of people across the country vehemently oppose ato the barbaric activity of fox hunting, including Tory voters living in the countryside. “The backlash Jeremy Hunt is already seeing, not least from the younger, future elements of the Conservative Party, should send unequivocal warnings that pledging to ‘bring back fox hunting’ is political poison.” Labour Party Chairman Ian Lavery said: “This Tory leadership race is going from bad to worse. “We’ve had Johnson’s tax cuts for the wealthy, a race to the bottom on no-deal Brexit, and now a pledge to bring back this barbaric practice that Labour had proudly banned.” But the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance gave Mr Hunt its backing. “The Hunting Act remains a source of massive resentment in the countryside and was passed for all the wrong reasons, unsupported by principle or evidence,” it said on its website. “ welcome Jeremy Hunt’s recognition that the Hunting Act represents an ongoing injustice that should be addressed.” Jeremy Hunt stood by his pledge to vote to scrap the hunting ban last night at a Tory hustings event in York.He gave a shoutout to the “lovely” Mirror Fox, who was waiting for him as he arrived at the venue.He said: “We had a lovely fox just outside the back entrance when we came in.” But asked whether he stood by his comments he said: “It has’t changed at all.”He said it would be a free vote issue, and as Prime Minister it would not be his “priority.”But he told the audience of Tory Party members: “I think in Yorkshire you like people who give a straight answer to a straight question. “I was asked what I would dothere was a vote in the House of Commons, and I answered it.”He added: “I know there are some people who change their answers for this audience or that audience.

A job where cleaners often weren’t paid at all – and at one point received no payment for three months.Despite working three cleaning jobs, Maritza began using the time between to organise other workers for change.   Today she is the President of the University of London branch of the International Workers of Great Britain Union, organising over  people in a union that has grown to , from a handful of cleaners, and is known for its carnival strike actions with vuvuzelas, drums and empanada pasties.Cleaners now have sick pay, holiday pay, the living wage, and are now campaigning to bring back in-house altogether.“I was an exploited worker,” Maritza told the Left Field, to huge applause at the  I chaired with John McDonnell, the TUC’s Clare Coatman and the IWGB’s Emiliano Mellino. “But I didn’t give up.”Mellino also told of other inspiring fights, organising outsourced Ernst  Young cleaners facing the sack “to save a few thousand pounds from a multi-billion-pound company” and the battle to get fuel and vehicle costs paid for couriers transporting NHS blood around the country.   Coatman, meanwhile told of the inventive ways she’s trying to bring exploited young workers into the union movement – including career coaching apps.John McDonnell, the ‘People’s Chancellor’ promised Labour would end outsourcing, zero hours contracts and oppressive welfare structures.And he said it would fulfil the promise of late leader John Smith that every worker would have trade union rights from day one of employment. “We have . million children in this country living in poverty,” he said.“The prediction is it will be five million within a short timethe Tories remain in office. Two-thirds of those kids live in families where someone is at work. These Tories have broken the link between work and actually being able to lt yourself out of poverty.“If you don’t believe me, read the United Nations’ rapporteur’s report. He says it’s destitution we now have in our society. That’s a result of the undermining of trade union rights, the undermining of collective bargaining and the undermining of basic wages.”   There were more people at Glastonbury than in the right-wing garden party currently deciding who will become our next Prime Minister. And, as we face the th year of Conservative rule and bitter Tory austerity, the festival is becoming noticeably more political. Opened by a parade led by Extinction Rebellion, the stunning festival headline act Stormzy had , people singing “F*** Boris” – whose devastating youth worker and police cuts while Mayor of London were also highlighted by the grime star’s Banksy-designed stab vest.On the Left Field, Bragg changed the lyrics to Bob Dylan’s The Times They Are A-Changing: “It’s obvious the climate is changing But the fool in the White House says no one’s to blame…”Meanwhile, having Johnny Marr at the festival was a way to sing along to Smiths songs guilt-free, now Morrissey’s gone all National Front Disco.The th anniversary year of the Left Field saw discussions on the hostile environment and reuniting Britain after Brexit.   “We have to hang on to our belief in each other,” Bragg told the crowd.The stage’s motto – on a green-red background, reflecting the tent’s political shades – is ‘Recharge your activism’.And escaping from the heat of the sun, people of all ages crawled in exhausted and left refreshed.This year in the big red tent, lost revellers might also have seen the new Muslim MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, Magid Magid, just hours before he was prevented from taking up his seat in the European Parliament because, he believes, he is “visibly dferent” from other MPs.If only every institution were like \u2028the Left Field – inclusive, energising.

BHS has gone as has Game and Lloyd’s Pharmacy.   There are fears about how long House of Fraser will be around and even the local chicken shop shut.But turn right from the station and you’ll find a thriving pedestrianised mall, Abbeygate, full of independent shops selling designer clothes and home furnishings.Freshney Place shopping centre is keeping its head above water and still boasts an MS, Waterstones and TK Maxx alongside a few charity shops.But Grimsby, population ,, knows that it has to changeit is to survive at a time when shoppers have less money and are moving online.The Freeman Street Market near the docks shows there is a way forward. Situated on a street of vaping shops, barbers and betting outlets this is an oasis in an area which was once bustling thanks to the town’s booming fishing industry.   Sean McGarel, managing director of the Royal Freemen of Grimsby, oversees the market.He’s enticed shoppers – the market is now % full – by offering far more than the chance to buy a punnet of strawberries and a cup of tea.There is two hours free parking for a start. And a car park ­attendant welcomes visitors, hands out ­information and gives directions.The market hosts art exhibitions, a recent one was by local people with mental health problems, dance classes and cookery demonstrations.Sean says: “When we first started redevelopment  years ago retail was pretty decent. Over the years we have evolved more into a community. A community centre almost.   “We have dferent dance groups, the NHS come in. We have our local residents group. We have a lot of arts and crafts. It’s not just a transaction, it’s an experience. It feels like a little bit of an oasis.”Freeman Street is building a ­reputation as a foodie centre, helping attract people from Grimsby’s affluent Top Town market.Lawrence Brown, management partner of Scotts Property, a sales and lettings agency that specialises in retail, believes Grimsby will be “massively” dferent in  years’ time.He says: “At the moment there is very little leisure activity in the evening. The local authority are encouraging development of a wide iety of dferent uses in the town centre that should bring in more culture in the evening that should bring people back here.”Across the Humber, Scarborough tells a story of high street stores closing and changing shopping habits. But the Yorkshire resort is fighting back thanks to an “independent ­revolution”.   Last year, Jenner Crowther was crowned high street champion for England in the Great British High Street awards for her helping in boosting Scarborough’s retail sector.The town has witnessed mixed fortunes in the past  months.Jenner says: “It’s worse in some ways as we have seen a lot of the big chain stores leave.” She rattles off the names: Thornton’s, ­Greenwood, Burton. While the mainstays of the high street are struggling, the ­independents are “thriving”. On the side streets, where rents and rates are lower, you can find dozens of shops.Jenner’s already helping retailers run “pop ups” in empty ­premises. Her plan is to open a department store made up of ­independents.Andrew Walker, who opened Walkers coffee shop two years ago, says: ­“Independents are soaring. ­Business has been ­spectacular.” He claims it is partly down to people “hitting back at capitalism”.   Andrew adds: “The big chains aggressively expanded while we kept under the radar. Now it’s our time.“People feel the big chains are faceless whereas ­independents are run by local people and can offer a more bespoke service..”Seven years ago, Alex Anderson opened Homebird House, which sells ­everything from cuddly toys to cards.In the early days he used to take his cat, Penelope, onto the main street and draw chalk instructions so people could find his shop. Alex says: “Unique shops are making the high street. Lots more are using ­independents.”Alex would like to expand into a bigger store on the main street but the rent would be £, a year. He says: “I would love to be on the high street, but I’m not going to spend that.”One clothing store in ­Scarborough may offer the solution to surviving in the online age.Mainline employs  people and has been listed as one of the top  online retailers in Europe. Nearly all its profits, %, come from online sales but head of marketing, ­Jonathan Patrick, says a high street ­presence is essential.He adds: “It is how we test brands. Watching people shop helps them understand what will work well online.

There’s nothing balanced about putting on your best riding jacket, blowing horns and pursuing defenceless animals to their death with a pack of blood-thirsty dogs for “sport”. It’s not my idea of sport. The BBC asked Hunt four times on Thursday whether he thought fox hunting was cruel.    Each time, he refused to answer. So, either he doesn’t think hunting is cruel but won’t admit it, or worse, he secretly does think it’s cruel, and is only supporting it to win votes with pro-hunting Tory members in the leadership election.Boris Johnson is no better. In  when Mayor of London, he made a sick joke about forming a fox-hunting gang in my constituency of Islington.He said he wanted to go out hunting in London with an air rle and “blaze away”.Tories have been trying to get rid of the hunting ban ever since it was introduced. David Cameron said he’d like to scrap it in . Theresa May said it again in .   It’s clear that when it comes to putting their party before the public interest, Tories are convinced that bringing back hunting is a big vote winner with the tiny number of Tory party members who get to choose the next Prime Minister.

But they will need to be ratied by MEPs before taking the jobs. And the European Parliament has elected a new President.But who are the the new EU office holders - and will they change the course of Brexit  Here’s everything you need to know. European Commission President   OutJean Claude JunckerInUrsula von der LeyenWho A close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Ms von der Leyen is the first woman in German history to hold the office of Minister of Defence, and she’s the first woman to be nominated to the European Commission Presidency. She’s also the only minister to have served continuously in Chancellor Merkel’s cabinet since she took office in .

Winred Woolmer was born in Brighton and lived in the south coast city her entire le. She died on June  aged  in Seaway Care Home in Hove, East Sussex. But she had always been a big fan of the wartime singer. So Derriman and Haynes Funeral Directors contacted Dame Vera, whose music was to be played at Mrs Woolmer’s funeral, to askshe would consider sharing a few words. But both they and the family were subsequently delighted with her reply.    For the singer, who lives in Ditchling, East Sussex, instead penned an entire eulogy on what it is like to be  and what is was like living through similar experiences such as both World Wars. It was read out at Mrs Woolmer’s funeral on Tuesday earlier this week. Dame Vera’s eulogy read: “Although I never had the pleasure of meeting Winred, I know that we must have shared many experiences and memories throughout our lives, right from the end of the First World War through to the Second, and all those years since. “We have both been fortunate enough to enjoy such long lives, and with that comes the opportunity to make so many wonderful memories and the chance to meet some truly special people.”     And Dame Vera added: “I was very pleased to learn that Winred enjoyed my music.

She lived next door to her mother in Patcham, Brighton, for about  years.     “I saw my mother almost every day. She was still pretty well towards the end.

While holding down several jobs, she also cared for several members of the family at home. Mrs Williams said: “She looked after her grandmother who lived with her because she was an invalid. And she also looked after her husband John Hillman, my father, who was also an invalid. “When he died she remarried to Frank Woolmer, who then also became an invalid and she had to look after him too while also caring for her younger sister and raising three of her own. “It was tough but she always managed to get something to youyou needed it. “You didn’t have benefits in those days and it can’t have been easy looking after all those people, but she did and she managed.” During the two world wars she acted as a carer, all while still holding down numerous jobs. “She was a carer her whole le really, and very hardworking,” her daughter said.

The Walt Disney Company - which owns the Marvel franchise - refused to give the go-ahead because they wanted to preserve “innocence” and “magic” around their characters.    A rejection email from the US-based giant offered the devastated family, from Maidstone, Kent, a personalised cel showing a scene from Spider-Man with a hand-written message to Ollie.

The family has accused the media of censoring their claims.Shukriaposs cousin, Mustaf Omar Mohamed, Shukri’s, told the Muslim news website  Pillars: “The police has told the media that it was a tragic accident so they have just repeated that, but we don’t think that stacks up.We don’t believe it was an accident, we believe there is more to this story and we don’t believe we are getting the answers and support we deserve from the police and the school. He added: “We know that Shukri was being bullied and so do the school and the police. It was name-calling and physical. I don’t know why she was being bullied but she was a timid, scared, vulnerable girl so she was an easy target. Her mum went to the school to report it and was even in the process of taking her out of the school.  He said the family want a proper investigation by the police and the school. Shukriaposs family and their supporters are holding a protest outside Broad Oak Sports College on Friday afternoon to unite and share our concerns for the safety of our children at the school, according to a poster circulating online. A petition calling for an investigation into the schoolaposs handling of bullying allegations has more than , signatures.has contacted Broad Oak Sports College for comment. Head teacher Paul Greenhalgh had previously paid tribute to Shukri, and sent a letter home to parents describing plans for a permanent memorial at school. A statement from Greater Manchester Police read: Please note that we will not be commenting on matters that are not police matters as it is not appropriate to do so. This includes family and school matters. For water safety matters, please contact the fire service. Should there be any developments in this case, we will issue it proactively. Thank you for your understanding. After the incident, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service watch manager Steve Wilcock said the girl had been with two friends. He said: When the crews arrived on the scene, there were two other children who had seen their friend disappear in the river.

Sir Trevor, , added that staff there seemed “genuine in their care and affection” for the animals.But the Mirror can reveal it is the same facility that came under fire after Michael Portillo visited on his BBC Great Indian Railway Journeys show last year.And photos taken months ago, posted on the Facebook page of the Elefantastic sanctuary, show tourists on the backs of elephants as they are washed.   One blogger who visited earlier this year even daubed “I Love NY” on the side of one of the animals in gaudy paint.They said: “While painting the elephant was a ton of fun, taking them for walks, like it’s your own pet, was a once-in-a-letime experience.” Campaigners say there is no “ethical way” to climb on an elephant as they are not designed to carry weight on their backs.ITV said the show made “very clear to the viewer the controversy surrounding the issue of elephants being kept in captivity” and that it “no way condones the riding of these majestic animals”.Sir Trevor accepts in the documentary that letting tourists paint the elephants “has been criticized”. He says elephants have often been “exploited, held captive, abused and used for entertainment”, adding there “is still a long way to go” to protect them.  ITV added: “Programme-makers sought and were given clear assurances that elephant rides were not being conducted at the sanctuary shown, and acted in good faith on the basis of the information received.” A source added: “Whilst at the sanctuary, the team saw no evidence of such activity.”But animal rights campaigners said ITV failed to adequately research the facility before giving it air time.Audrey Gaffney, of the Ethical Bucket List, said: “Sir Trevor has made a genuine attempt to discuss issues concerning captive elephants. He does grasp that they suffer in many of the captive situations. But it is very disappointing to see him visit this facility though which is a very clear case of failure on behalf of the researchers.”   Dr Chris Draper of the Born Free Foundation said: “Elephants do not need to be washed, petted or painted by humans, nor to be managed as part of a tourist attraction. A genuine sanctuary would focus on providing space that permits elephants to be elephants, minimising their contact with people.”BBC’s Paradise Gardens, in which Monty Don rode an elephant, was taken off air last year amid cruelty claims.The Mirror found footage of animals being beaten where Monty’s ride was filmed.And Martin Clunes was\u2028dropped as a patron of Born Free after being filmed on an elephant for another ITV show."},{"url":null,"title":"jaw dropping transformation mcdonalds addict","story":"NewsJaw-dropping transformation of McDonalds addict so obese she didnt leave houseMum-of-two Clairine Potter, , says she has achieved a healthier, happier le after swapping her fatty diet for healthy meals and exerciseShareCommentsByChris Jaffray:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news real-le-stories video mcdonalds-addict-who-relied-cheeseburgers-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn obese mum who was addicted to McDonaldaposs has shed almost five stone by dropping her daily burger habit. Mum-of-two Clairine Potter became housebound due to her st lbs, size  frame, after guzzling on cheeseburgers and wrap meals for every lunch and fatty takeaways for dinner. The -year-oldaposs anxiety about her size was so great she even moved her professional hairdressing business from a salon to her house in Manchester. Fearing leaving the house also meant she avoided spending time with sons Franky, eight, and Louie, seven. But after deciding to change her le, the mum swapped burgers for salads and began weight lting and running - and now is a fitness le coach who inspires her clients with her slinky  stone, size  to  physique.    Clairine said: I moved my salon to my house, I did not like going out, I felt anxiety and it was all a bit overwhelming. The anxiety came on even when I was in the car. I wouldnapost even go to family weddings or socialise with my friends - I completely isolated myself. At my peak I was  and a half stone and a size , I felt really ashamed. Clairineaposs transformation began in January  when she started the new year vowing to change her le and joined a apos Days To Healthy Livingapos course and aposCouch to kapos running programme. Since the age of  the single mum had struggled with her fluctuating weight and would yo-yo diet frequently, shedding a few pounds only to put more on. But she claims this time was dferent as the online communities she joined accepted her - helping her ditch her seven-days-a-week McDonalds habit and penchant for picking up a takeaway from a dferent outlet for tea every night.    On top of that Clairine would drink a bottle of white wine most nights to wash down the food but reduced her booze intake by going teetotal for five months and drinking protein shakes instead. And by June the same year - within just six months - Clairine had dropped a third of her weight to just  stone, before vowing never to weigh herself again. Now the mum is a trainee personal trainer and loves climbing mountains as a hobby - while she has also rediscovered her culinary skills, making home-cooked food like healthy chicken pies and stir fries for tea. Clairine said: The online programmes changed my le. For me, it was about loving myself again and reconnecting with my body. I believe I am a really good-looking girl, but before I lost the weight I was hating myself and thinking I wasnapost good enough. Having undertaken a diploma in le coaching, Clairine is currently working towards another qualication in fitness training and now helps other people who were in her predicament.    And her fitness transformation didnapost stop with running, as she has since climbed up Machu Picchu and even walked the Inca Trail. When the mum was at her worst she used to stay by herself in a room and spend little time with her kids, but she now takes them on active adventures like cycling together. Clairine said: I want to help others do what I have done. It is about self-love and self-appreciation. Now I do not assess myself with a number for happiness. I have gone from not being able to go out of my living room to walking up a mountain. I am a  year old with two children running a business, keeping fit and healthy.    Clairineaposs Daily Diet before BREAKFAST: Cheese on toast LUNCH: McDonaldaposs cheeseburger and wrap meal DINNER: A dferent takeaway every night SNACKS: Two to three Boost bars at a time DRINKS: One bottle of red wine a night Clairineaposs daily diet now BREAKFAST: Protein with oats or cereals enriched with minerals and fibre LUNCH: Salad DINNER: Home-cooked curry or chicken cashew stir fry SNACKS: None DRINKS: Protein shakes "},{"url":null,"title":"lost dog returns six years","story":"NewsLost dog s SIX YEARS after boy wrote letter to bad men who snatched puppyEight-year-old Ethan Ferrier thought hed never see his black spaniel Fern ever again after it was stolen from the family farmShareCommentsByJeremy Armstrong:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsEthan, now , is reunited with his lost dog \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA little boy who wrote his first ever letter to the “bad men” who snatched his puppy has been ­reunited with his pet six years later. Eight-year-old Ethan Ferrier cried tears of joy when he finally saw his black spaniel Fern again. As a two-year-old, he was heartbroken when she was stolen from the family farm in April . Aged just four, Ethan wrote the letter, saying: “To the bad men who took Fern. Can Fern come home now please  I miss her.” His parents, carer Jodie, , and workshop manager Tom, , never gave up hope, as their pet had a microchip under her skin.  And out of the blue, this week, a vet called to say Fern had been handed in. Jodie said: “It is a real-le miracle. I have just spoken with the lovely man, Jerry Oliver, who found her running in the middle of the road. “He stopped his car, jumped out and got her…Then he took her to the vet, who scanned her and all the information was there. We have moved several times, but I had religiously updated that chip.”  Now living on the Isle of Wight, the entire family – including Ethan’s sister Abbie, four, and six-month-old brother Rowan – boarded a ferry and headed straight to the vet’s, in Twyford, Berks, to collect their long-lost pet. Speaking back at home yesterday, Jodie said: “As soon as I saw her, I knew it was our dog, at last.” And she explained that Ethan had “burst into tears” when she was found and told his mum: “I cannot believe it.” Jodie added: “We worked so hard to find her – and now it is like Fern has never been away.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results live winning numbers","story":"NewsLotto results LIVE: Winning numbers for tonights National Lottery Set For LeThe winning National Lottery numbers for the Set For Le draw for Thursday July , , will be revealed belowShareByDanya BazaraaNews ReporterUpdated:,  JUL NewsYou have to be in it to win it to scoop the big prizes in tonights National Lottery\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news lotto-results-live-winning-numbers- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"A le-changing prize of £, every month for the next  years is up for grabs in tonight’s National Lottery Set For Le draw.

Dominic Nielen-Groen, aged , met the girl on an Instagram community called Daddy Dom Little Girl which caters for people who fantasise about older men dominating younger women. The orced father-of-two Nielen-Groen called himself Papa Bear on the site. He travelled  miles from his home in Wolverhampton to meet her at a play park in Seaton, East Devon. There, he hugged her and talked for  minutes before trying to get her to put a childaposs dummy in her mouth. Police found another dummy and a collar with the words Little Girl on it in his bedroom along with a  Shades style contract setting out rules and punishments. The punishments included spanking, self spanking, slaps, cold baths, being tied up, as well as time out and no television or internet. Some rules and penalties were overtly sexual, including bans on masturbation and taking part in ious sex acts at the behest of the aposDaddyapos. Nielen-Groen, whose case is at Exeter Crown Court, has been told he will receive a long jail sentence.  The girl, now , told the jury how she attracted , followers and sold pictures of her naked breasts and bottom to them via a Paypal account. Birmingham City University graduate Nielen-Groen, of Wolverhampton, denied meeting a child after grooming with the intention of committing a sexual offence but was convicted. Recorder Mr Jonathan Barnes adjourned his sentence until next month and ordered a probation report which will assess his level of dangerousness. He told him:It is almost inevitable there will have to be a substantial prison sentence in this case. During a four day trial Nielen-Groen claimed the girl had never told him her age and he believed her to be an adult who was engaging in age-play and role-play fantasies. He said he travelled to Devon to meet her but had no intention of taking part in any sexual activity with her. He said he was shocked when she told him her age for the first time in the park in Seaton. The girl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - told the jury how she joined the Daddy Dom Little Girl community, known as DDLG, because she was lonely and wanted to find new friends online. At first she found it amazing but soon realised there was a sinister side to some of the other users. Her Instagram account remained online for months before it was removed. She said:It grew very quickly and I became part of a community. I knew it was kind of wrong and edgy but I wanted to do it. I wanted to be part of it and for people to talk to me. I would take pictures of my body and send them for money. They were pictures of a chest and bum. I had about  contacts at a time messaging me. She said parts of the DDLG site were marked as + but she her account was not and she told him she was . She said: Some were + but many were under age. I grew to have over , followers. I did block some men. I did sell some pictures. I did not advertise that but I posted my Paypal on my story once. It was not a recurring theme. The majority of men who talked to me did want sexual conversations. I talked to over  a day on direct message. There were hundreds in all. I told some I was over age but said I was  to the majority.

Aaron Irvine, a former pupil at a fee paying private school, dressed all in black with a sinister balaclava and latex black gloves. On his back was a black rucksack containing everything he thought he would need for his depraved mission, Luton Crown Court heard. He was armed with a hunting kne, a lock kne and in the rucksack was a rope, tape, a black utility belt, a shoe lace, wet wipes, a lock pick and a change of clothing.  On his mobile phone were surveillance photos he had taken of her secluded home in the Bedfordshire village where she lived with her family. Today Irvine, , was told he was facing a y spell behind bars after a jury found him guilty of trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence and sexual assault. He was acquitted of a charge of attempted rape. After the conclusion of the trial today Judge Barbara Mensah remanded him in custody for the preparation of psychiatric and pre-sentence reports which will assess the danger he poses. On Wednesday January  the rugby club barman drove from his home in Bedford to the girl’s secluded detached house in the mid-Bedfordshire countryside. The girl’s parents were out, but her -year-old friend was at the house and they were together in her bedroom watching TV. The day before Irvine had sent a Snapchat text to the girl enquiringshe had a boyfriend, and asking “how available” she was. When she replied she was “out of a relationship,” he is alleged to have sent her a message saying: “Well, I’m known to be very good at making girls happy x” In court she told the jury she hadn’t replied, saying: “It was a weird comment. It implied something I wasn’t comfortable with.” It was around .pm that afternoon when there was a knock at the door at the house and the girls went downstairs from the bedroom. When the door was opened, a figure dressed in black and wearing a balaclava and brandishing a kne was standing there. The girl, who is now , told Luton Crown Court what happened next.  She said he held the kne as he began caressing her face and hair, and touched her breasts and bottom and tried to make her commit a sex act on him by forcing her head towards his groin area. The teenager said he continued to touch her in the drawing room of the house and upstairs in her bedroom. She said she pleaded with him to take any property he wanted, including iPhones and iPads, and to leave, but he told her: “Oh you wouldn’t want your parents to come home and find everything’s been taken, surely you just give me something in .” The girl went on: “He wanted to come to my house and rape me. It’s pretty clear, because when we left him he didn’t take anything. Nothing was missing.” The court was told the girl and her friend managed to escape from the house and raise the alarm. Irvine, who is now , ran off through a local wood near the girl’s home and changed out of a black jumper he had been wearing and was wearing a blue hoodie. He was quickly arrested by police who had responded to a  call. Later that day, when officers searched the defendant’s home in Bedford they found a notebook in his bedroom. The jury heard that in it were a number of entries, but one entitled “Forced Compliance” said: “Given her complete disregard of respect towards us, we have no choice other than to force her to fulfill our needs. We have her address. Home address is the most opportune location. “However we still need to identy the exact house on her street and establish the best entry and exit points. This will require surveillance. A method to empty the house may be required, however the directness of this method is subject to change. Prosecutor Peter Shaw said the “obvious inference” was that the entry related to the -year-old girl and his visit to her home on January . “It’s an extraordinary coincidence. It is entitled “Forced Compliance.” How interesting that the defendant equipped himself with two knives and was happy to brandish a hunting kne. “One can consider his obviously frightening appearance in a balaclava and black clothing and what effect that would be likely on someone confronted with that view. Then consider the rope and tape he had with him. “The prosecution asks does that not sound like the equipment required to a “forced compliance ” He said he knew from the Snapchat messages that no boyfriend would be on the property, which was the most opportune location because it was “rather remote, off the beaten track and not overlooked.” Mr Shaw said the defendant had referred in the entry to forcing “her to fulfill our needs” and went on “What sort of needs could they be ” He said the answer was in the girl’s account of how the teenager tried to push her head down to his groin, which was a “clear and unmistakable inference that he was trying to get her to provide oral sex.” Irvine pleaded not guilty to trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence, attempted rape and sexual assault. The girl told the jury that at first when she saw the figure in the doorway wearing a balaclava and dressed in black with the kne, she did wonderit was a joke. But she said he then walked towards her and began caressing her face and running his black latex gloved fingers through her hair before moving his hand to her chest area. The teenager told the jury the man told her: “I came to get stuff, but you can persuade me not to take anything.  She said he “started to touch my boobs” and she said he traced the area of her left breast with his hand “quite hard.” Continuing her evidence to the jury she said throughout the ordeal he wore the balaclava and she went on: “I saw his eyes and they were hazel and he had extremely long eyelashes and his eyebrows were brown.” The girl described him as “broad shouldered” and slim and told the jury: “He had a similar accent to mine - it was posh.” During the trial the court was told it was in August of  that he had first contacted the girl her through a social media site and during the summer, they had text conversations about school and exams. The court was told in one message he told her: “I meanyou are interested I might be able to make le a lil bit better.” She replied and told him: “I’m sorry but I have a boyfriendthat’s what you are implying. I’m all up for being friends though.” He is said to have then said “Ay that’s fine I didn’t know so I thought I’d seeyou were interested before getting to know someone you get my meaning, no hard feelings.” Continuing her evidence to the jury, his victim told the jury “He started to be quite vigorous and he put his arm round the back of my neck and he started to try to force me down to where his bits were and stuff. But I stopped, I just said ‘No, look I don’t want this.” The jury was told both girls were taken to the alleged victim’s bedroom where her friend managed to kick the defendant in the groin and shortly afterwards they were able to escape from the house. In the witness box Irvine a former pupil at the fee-paying Bedford Modern School who at the time was working behind the bar at Bedford Blues Rugby Club said he had only gone to the girl’s home with the intention of scaring her. He was asked why he had dressed all in black and put in the balaclava and said he had wanted to create the image of a special forces soldier. “I was already interested in the Special Forces,” he told the court, and said he had considered joining them but thought his eyesight and asthma might be a barrier. He said he had always played special forces computer games. He denied he had touched the girl’s bottom or her breasts and denied he had tried to push her heard towards his groin area.

The documents relate to Porton Down, the famous military science centre in Wiltshire, the Daily Star reports. The maximum security base played a pivotal role investigating the Russian Novichok attack in Salisbury, Wilts, and is in the frontline battle against chemical and biological weapons. The Ministry of Defence has launched a probe as former Defence Secretary Sir Malcolm Rkind led calls for a Government inquiry. One former police officer, who dealt with Porton Down, said: “This % could have ended catastrophically. Someone somewhere has not done their job. “What could have happened is far worse than what did.”    The Star was alerted to the dumping of the sensitive records last week by a member of the public. Thousands of pages of highly personal information were then found in a paper recycling bin in a north London car park. The explosive haul of information linked to the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down included details of equipment carried by guards at the site. Also discovered was the home address of a guard, details about the responsibilities of specialised police who patrol the perimeter of the base, and the password to computer systems written in plain text. One intelligence expert described the papers as a “terrorist’s dream” as the bin is in a known spot for “dumpster ers” – homeless people hunting food and goods to sell on.    Sir Malcolm added: “You would have an inquiry in a situation like this, especially when there is a risk of this information falling into the hands of foreign powers or terrorists. This would automatically lead to an inquiry.” The papers date from the early s to the end of . Their discovery comes just months after Porton Down identied the deadly Novichok nerve agent that poisoned Russian turncoat spy Sergei and daughter Yulia, and killed Dawn Sturgess. The Government blamed two Russian assassins for the attack, sparking a diplomatic incident. Porton Down – one of the most secretive military installations in the world – originally researched chemical warfare during World War One.  Since then it has evolved to focus on “developing effective countermeasures” against foreign attacks on UK assets and our allies abroad, according to the base’s website. It holds deadly substances such as the Ebola virus and nerve agent Sarin. Its website says: “The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory ensures that innovative science and technology contribute to the defence and security of the UK.”  An MOD spokesman said: “We take the protection of personal data very seriously and we have a range of procedures in place to do so, including complying with the Data Protection Act.We also expect third parties who legitimately hold out data to apply similar strict procedures. “We can confirm that an investigation has been launched” .

Our new research shows  per cent of us are dissatisfied with how our bathrooms work for us, yet the average Brit hasn’t spruced up their bathroom in five years. The research also found seven in  Brits find sharing a bathroom ‘frustrating’. One third said the top annoyance is finding the last of the toilet roll hasn’t been replaced and a fth can’t stand finding hair left down the plug hole.    Seventeen per cent get frustrated with other members of their household hogging the room. Husbands and boyfriends were found to cause the most frustrations, according to  per cent. And perhaps they just want to get away from everyone - one in six of everyone polled revealed they have hidden in the bathroom – to get some ‘peace and quiet’. The most in demand time for the bathroom was revealed as am as families and households face the morning rush. Despite frustrations, the bathroom is also the place where many important le moments are experienced, including a pep talk in the mirror , the odd argumentand having a heart to heart . Those polled also recalled precious parenting milestones such as baby’s first bath , potty training , teaching teenage children how to shaveand even giving birth .    More than half of those polled believe having a great bathroom is ‘key’ to feeling happy in their home.

It is more than two months now since Daniel Linsey, , and his sister Amelie, , were killed in Sri Lanka’s Easter Sunday Massacre terror attack. Their shellshocked father, Matthew, who escaped without injury, then had to lug the bags home alone. Yet the grieving family cannot begin to unpack them. More painful still, are two more sets of clothes which only recently arrived. The clothes the teenagers – two of eight British victims amid  slaughtered in a string of suicide bombings – died in.    “My father wanted them, but it was probably the hardest thing,” reveals elder brother David, eyes wide with emotion. “My brother’s clothes are completely ripped up, but on my sister’s blue dress there are just two little punctures around here…” he says, gesturing to his heart. This family’s shock and sorrow is still tangibly raw yet, amid it, David, , has made an unexpected decision. The oldest sibling, who opted to revise for university exams rather than join his sister and brother on holiday in Sri Lanka with their dad, wants to fly there and visit the hotel where they died. “My parents said initially they would rather I didn’t go,” he admits. “But they have come to terms with it now, and how important it is for me.    “I don’t know how I will react, but I think I should pay my respects at the place. Otherwise I will have a mental wall around it. “I think going there will help to release some of the stress I have built up. “I’m hoping the whole trip will be a cathartic experience.” It was unusual for this close family not to holiday together but, as well as David needing to work, little brother Ethan, , and mum Angelina, decided they also preferred to stay at home. On April , Amelie, Daniel and Matthew were enjoying their final ­breakfast at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo before flying home, when the Islamic State terrorists struck.    Luxury hotels and churches were the targets of eight bombings. Businessman Matthew, , survived because he was further from the blast. David may look young, but he speaks with a maturity beyond his years. Just two days after his siblings’ deaths he launched a charity in their names. The Amelie and Daniel Linsey Foundation raises funds for Sri Lankan victims, and the hospital that treated his siblings. The medical facility struggled after the attack and, incredibly, he has already organised for a group of trauma experts from the US to assess its needs.    He has raised £, so far. David says: “My dad said it was chaos in the hospital. They didn’t have capacity.” His trip is also aimed at meeting victims’ families. He says: “They are the only people who can relate. “They are definitely suffering. I want to make sure they have a place to live, access to counselling and education.” The Linseys’ Central London home feels heavy with silence, where once the shrieks of four siblings filled rooms. On the kitchen table sit teetering stacks of family photos running into hundreds, which Matthew, an investor in emerging markets, is religiously arranging in albums. It is his way of helping to process his grief. “My dad spends all day doing this. I have never seen many of them before,” David admits, explaining how for all his apparent composure, he is “up and down” and struggles to sleep alone.    Many of the photos show the close family grinning in far-flung locations. Both Amelie and Daniel were “adventurous, open people” and ­“fearless”, David says. He would have liked to have gone to Sri Lanka with them, but his course at Oxford studying economics and management, took priority. “I was a bit envious,” he admits, recalling the pair leaping around the now-empty lounge packing to music videos – his final memory of them. David struggles with the fact he wasn’t with them when they died.    He explains: “I tried to look out for them as a brother, and that’s very hard, feeling you weren’t there. “But it’s not like they were doing anything dangerous, they were just having breakfast.” Matthew has described how the children were hit by a wave of pressure from the first blast, then ran towards the exit –directly into a second blast. They were knocked unconscious and taken to hospital where they died. “We just know they didn’t suffer, that’s the most important thing. My dad told me they didn’t scream, everyone was silent,” says David. The family in England were awakened by Matthew’s anguished call. “I heard a commotion and screaming,” recalls David, who sleeps in the basement. “My dad was on the phone and my -year-old brother told me what had happened because my mum couldn’t really speak.” Matthew later video-called from the chaotic hospital, shrapnel marks across his face, voice almost gone. He kept saying he was sorry.    Afterwards, he could do ­nothing more than fly home with his children’s suitcases on Easter Monday. David went to collect him from the airport. He recalls: “He was still wearing the same clothes because they were the last clothes he had given them a hug in. I could smell the blast. “He was only running on adrenalin. Thank god we got him back, we are together, what is left of us.”  His siblings have now been buried in the US, close to his grandmother’s home – Matthew is American – because it’s a place they loved to visit. The charity was a way of channelling David’s grief, he says, combined with the instant, selfless realisation his parents needed that channel, too. He’s taken a year off university to pursue the charity, explaining: “My parents lived entirely for their children, and so when this happened it took away a huge part of their le.  “There has to be something that brings good out of this evil, that will give them something to live for – this is what I’m trying to do.” It is also so that Daniel and Amelie are not only remembered for being victims of a terror attack.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

The lane floods, so between trying to dodge puddles, you land in dog dirt.I wish they would fix the path because a lot of people use it, some of them pensioners with or parents with prams.Celia MacFarlane, Lochgilphead.Sir,Seven out of ten people with diabetes feel overwhelmed by the demands of their condition and this signicantly affects their mental and physical health.That is why we are calling for new national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health support and to increase support available in Argyll to people living with diabetes.As part of Diabetes UK’s Diabetes Weekwe are urging people in Argyll to #SeeDiabetesDferently and back our campaign for national standards for diabetes mental health support and services.Our recently published research revealed the relentless nature of diabetes can impact people’s emotional well-being and mental health, ranging from day-to-day frustration and low mood, to specic psychological and mental health dficulties including clinical depression and anxiety.The findings, published in the report #Too often missing: Making emotional and psychological support routine in diabetes care#, show that diabetes is much more than a physical condition – and that emotional and psychological demands of living with diabetes should be recognised and support provided.Diabetes Scotland is urgently calling on the NHS to create national standards for diabetes emotional and mental health services. These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

today.Representatives from the UK Government, the Scottish Government and five councils that represent the region were in Peebles on Monday to sign the Heads of Terms for investment of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up to pound million in the Borderlands Deal.ldquoThis is an ambitious approach to cross-border working between Governments, local authorities and partners which will boost economic growth by helping existing business, encouraging new ventures and bringing a wealth of improvements to people who live and work in the area and to visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost parts of England operate as a single economic area and it is important the border is not allowed to become an obstacle to development.South Scotland Labour MSP and Scottish Labourrsquos Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Connectivity and Transport, Colin Smyth, has welcomed the news but warned that the Borderlands deal will not provide a quick fix for the challenges facing the region.He said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous praise for developing the projects and getting to this stage, given that many people predicted it would be impossible to bring councils from across the border together in this way.ldquoEveryone now needs to get on with delivering the projects.ldquoThis will not be a panacea for the regionrsquos massive economic challenges.ldquoIt works out at around poundm a year over ten years for the whole of the south of Scotland which is quite modest.ldquoHowever, it will bring some badly needed investment into projects that could make a real dference to the local economy."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners-ignored-as-eildon-housing-approved","story":"CAMPAIGNERS say their concerns ldquofell on deaf ears after Scottish Borders Council approved a controversial planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

who are thought to be private iniduals and not public figures, their names are not being released.There is also the view that as Archie is seventh in line to the throne, and unlikely to be a full-time

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

Dont politicians always over-promise, throw money at the voters, spend astheres no tomorrow  Well, no actually they donrsquot ndash especially not Conservatives. You dont have to go back to the fiscally dry-as-dust Thatcher era to hear the mantra: ldquoonly spend what we can afford. The former Labour Chancellor, Gordon Brown, worshipped a god called ldquoprudence in the s, believing that Labour had lost successive elections because it couldnt be trusted with the purse strings of government.In  the Tories formed a government with the Liberal Democrats, which pledged to restore the nations finances by the most radical cost-cutting. It was called ldquoausterity\". George Osbornes programme was compared to the ldquoGeddes Axe ndash the eye-watering spending cuts imposed by the coalition Chancellor, Sir Eric Geddes, in .:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyIts worth reminding Jo Swinson, as she bids to be the next LibDem leader, that the Liberal Democrats endorsed Osbornes austerity. Indeed, Vince Cable, still says that austerity was ldquonecessary\".No one  seems to be saying that. There has been a seismic sht in the politics of public finance as politicians have suddenly abandoned the old language of fiscal rectitude. And not just in Britain. President Macron of France has had to reverse his public finance reforms. Donald Trump, despite all his rhetoric, has just put forward a record . trillion budget.What seems to have happened is that politicians of left and right, but most strikingly of the right, have become influenced by the rise of the populists. Populism is often wrongly regarded as a traditional conservative ideology boosted by anti-immigration nativism. This is a mistake. Asand YouGovs six-month study of the phenomenon pointed out, populists are much more left than conventional right, and generally seek to reduce inequality.ldquoThis is not something we expected to see, said Kirk Hawkins of . ldquoPopulism, in the end, is attractive because it takes seriously the grievances of people who feel abandoned and unfairly treated. In the crucible of Brexit, the traditional party of the right has realised that it must do something to address these grievances, or cease to exist as a political force.Im not suggesting that populists are the New Left. Only a fool would believe the promises being made on public spending. Donald Trumps spending splurge has largely been on defence and building a border wall. But the change in the ideological agenda is too striking to ignore.Jeremy Corbyns  Labour Manesto emerges, in retrospect, as relatively modest in its spending proposals. The SNP under Nicola Sturgeon is also beginning to look a little, er, conservative in its approach to public finances.As the former SNP MP George Kerevan pointed out, the SNPs Sustainable Growth Commission report, with its plans to hold spending to % below GDP, has many similarities with the austerity programme of George Osborne after . At the very least, the SGC represents a covenant with the Scottish electorate that an independent Scottish Government would only spend within its means and would not indulge in radical deficit financing.Tell that to the Tories! Theyve discovered the magic money tree. They seem to be adopting the left wing economics of Modern Monetary Theory, which says that public spending deficits dont matter because governments can always print money.Of course, this is all in the context of Brexit. We are in an age of febrile politics. There will be a reckoning. When its over, and the tide goes out, well soon see, as Warren Buffet likes to put it, whos been bathing without their costume on."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Why age isn   t a barrier to power in our youth-driven society","story":"You canrsquot help wonderingthe rumours about Mr Corbynrsquos declining memory, attention span, strength and general fitness come from real evidence of reduced capabilities, orthey are a fiendishly contagious conspiracy, cooked up to topple him before he has a chance to become the next Prime Minister. Scuttlebutt insists that the -year-old is nothing but a puppet, leaning on colleagues for support, mouthing their ideas, and too decrepit to do much more than clutch the lectern and issue an occasional rallying call to his troops.With most unfrail alacrity, Mr Corbyn has refuted all these suggestions ndash apparently made by senior civil servants ndash and is asking for an independent inquiry into whoever is spreading such lies. He is right to insist on this, but sadly the damage is already done. Now every blink and tremor, every hesitation and stumble, will be cause for analysis and concern.No-one beyond the Labour leaderrsquos closest family and associates can know how much,any, truth this gossip holds. Wersquove been told about eye problems, but are they an indication of more serious underlying health problems  Or is it simply that the burdens of office are exhausting him, making him appear older than his years  Impossible to tell. With a man whose demeanour has always been more energy-saving bulb than dynamo, it is dficult to detect any appreciable dimming of wattage.As questions were being asked about his ability to run the party, let alone turn the key in the door of Number , I found myself thinking of Mr Corbyn when watching democratic hopefuls for the next US presidential nomination. Bernie Saunders, who will be  in September, is impressively impassioned, but he cannot surely be anybodyrsquos idea of the perfect candidate, given the demands that would be made of him in arguably the most high-profile and pressured job in the world. Joe Biden, too, at  is scarcely a spring chicken. Like Mr Saunders, he was born while the Second World War was getting into gear. As for the American president, even his worst enemies have to concede that at  he still seems to be possessed of enough energy to make international deals and travel the globe, with never a sign of flagging.This might all sound unpleasantly ageist. Yet with a few notable exceptions, most mortals begin to slow down intellectually as well as physically as they reach their biblical span of three score years and . This is not to say that there are not many fruitful, useful and enjoyable years ahead, but it is to suggest that the gruelling schedules expected of modern politicians, be they first ministers or presidents, senators or MPs, is no longer an arena in which those past their prime will easily flourish. A century ago, there would have been little or no public outcry over an elderly or enfeebled prime minister or party leadercolleagues could keep the government on track. In this, Britain had the benefit of centuries of precedent with royalty. From before the Stuarts to George III, kings and queens, with a little help from friends at court, continued to pass edicts and legislation, sign death warrants and go to war, while, whether through ill health, insanity or senility, they were completely unfit for office.Read more: Labour demands probe into civil serviceWith the onward march of democracy, however, has come greater visibility, transparency and accountability. Technology might have transformed our domestic workload, but for those in the political front line, the digital revolution has turned night into day. Dedication and accessibility   is the least voters now expect. No wonder so many images of MPs shows them in running gear, pounding the pavements and turning strawberry pink. This is not just a metaphor but a practical necessitythey are to survive the punishing regime their role demands.Despite much talk about our fast-ageing population, there has never been a period that is so youth-driven, or when the old have been so easily and cruelly dismissed as irrelevant or past-it because they have one foot still in a pre-tech world. The gulf between those born while ration books were circulating, and those whorsquod mastered an iPhone before their milk teeth were cut, is eye-wateringly wide. What does someone of pensionable age understand of the Snapchat generation  Other than the most basic human needs, such as security, work, and dignity, which transcend any barriers of time and class, colour and creed, what can an elderly politician offer a youthful electorate Well, perhaps more than yoursquod think. Clearly, what wersquore witnessing with the ongoing popularity of those like Mr Saunders and Donald Trump, is the triumph of longevity and experience over vigour. Their retro appeal is in part thanks to a letimersquos accumulation of high-powered connections and skills. Why be surprised that some dream even now of Ken Clarke taking over the Tory Party to bring it to its senses, despite him being almost as ancient as the Fortingall yew  Or that others rejoice at the distant prospect of Ann Widdecombe resurrecting her political career and ing as a Brexit Party MP.Experience, and the informed perspective it allows, is by far the greatest advantage of seniority. Is this what the young see when they look at people like Mr Corbyn, who lavishes more care on his allotment than on clear-cut policy yet commands widespread respect and even affection or why the venerable-looking Mr Saunders made such an impression with his brand of democractic socialism that he threatened to make Hillary Clinton toast It would seem so. Evidence suggests, indeed, that despite living in a world designed for youth, where to be in any way incapacitated or slow is to be invisible and ignored, we are nevertheless hard-wired as humans to defer to age. Rightly or wrongly, our instincts tell us that with wrinkles or bald pate, dentures or dodgy knees, comes hard-won wisdom.

Having worked for the BBC in the past, I continue to appear on it occasionally and should include myself in those ranks.Tough love needs to be dispensed because those at the top of the corporation are clearly not getting the message. It is time, dear Auntie, to get your act together or get your coat.The corporationrsquos defence can be split into three parts. First, it is not to blame for . million pensioners losing their free licences. Correct. A Labour government introduced the measure, a Conservative Chancellor, George Osborne, then dumped the bill in the BBCrsquos lap after barely any public consultation.Next defence: the BBC has to pay talent what it is worth otherwise the stars will go where. Nonsense. Certainly, the BBC has had some of its better known names quit for the private sector, among them Chris Evans, Eddie Mair, and Simon Mayo. But there are only so many Evans-size salaries out there, and only one Chris Evans. The idea that private enterprises are ready to splurge vast reserves of cash on an exodus of BBC talent is laughable. What would their shareholders say for a start : BBC says it is doing wellAs for the old Lrsquooreal defence ndash the stars are worth it ndash really  Gary Lineker is worth more than a Prime Minister, a First Minister, a surgeon, a teacher, almost any profession you care to mention  Steve Wright, for pressing buttons and singing over the music, merits a pound, pay packet As for Huw Edwards, almost half a million pounds for anchoring the news, a skill that can be summed up as ldquoreading aloud  It is not just on-screen iniduals either. More than  managers earn over pound,.Meanwhile, the poor bloody infantry, the ones who put in the night shts and the weekends, the ones who make the talent shine, are stuck on low pay and rolling contracts that offer little in the way of job security. Never mind, they can at least comfort themselves with the knowledge that the gender pay gap between well paid men at the corporation and well paid women is closing, with three women now in the top ten earners. As for everyone , good luck with the claims, now inching along like tipsy slugs.The last of the BBCrsquos defences is that it costs a lot of money to provide what it does, but it still provides great value. The answer to that is simple: stop doing so much. No one asked for BBC Sounds. No one asked the BBC to build a vast online news empire, paid for by the state, that took jobs, readers, and advertisers from newspapers.: Anger as Beechgrove is prunedThe new BBC Scotland channel is a case in point of the corporation trying and failing to deliver what it thinks viewers want.Take, for example, The Nine, the channelrsquos flagship news show. Just the blend of local, national and international news required, all of it from a Scottish perspective. You see reports on here you never would on the Six or the Ten, which fulfils the remit exactly. It is the kind and quality of show thatit had been on at six orsquoclock would be hauling in the viewers. But it is on at nine orsquoclock, right up against the mainstream channelsrsquo big hitter dramas and documentaries, so its viewing figures are ridiculously low.The Nine languishes where it is because the BBC in London was terried of a Scottish Six, fearing it would be a sop to nationalism. To disguise that lack of courage a whole new channel was constructed at greater cost. While some of the new channelrsquos offerings have been well worth watching, Yes No: Inside the Indyref chief among them, they could have easily found a home on the existing BBC  Scotland. As for the rest, the stale soup of repeats and shows that should never have been made in the first place ndash who needed another quiz show  ndash are dragging the channel down. When it comes time to make cuts, as it inevitably will, which programme will go: the relatively expensive The Nine or the cheap as chips fare The corporation might tell itself it is catering for a new, younger viewer who watches television in a dferent way, but there it goes again, looking in the wrong place for answers. Instead of trying to please a generation that wonrsquot pay for anythingit can get away with it, the BBC should be satisfying its existing customers more.The BBC will never have pockets deep enough to match Netflix or Amazon. What it does have is the ability to do certain things very well, such as drama. More Bodyguard and Killing Eve and less dross would be just the thing for the discerning viewer. People do not want an endless choice. Just scrolling through the Netflix menu is becoming exhausting.By cutting back the big wages, and building on the success of Studios, the corporationrsquos profitable production and distribution ision, the BBC can start to get serious about reducing its dependence on a licence fee that is not going to be around forever.In Years and Years there was a happy ending, normal civilised society was restored and the BBC came back.

Road safety operations are regularly carried out across the region in response to community concerns, which include high visibility patrols with enforcement action taken where necessary.ldquoI would always ask people to ride or drive safely with considerationfor other road users and we are continually campaigning to improve safety, including supporting the keep left campaign to remind tourists to drive on the left.Earlier officers in the Highlands responded to concerns from local councillors with a pledge to make sure motorists would see traffic patrols - something that was once almost unheard-of on what would have been quiet rural roads.Chief Superintendent George MacDonald said: ldquoWe have committed , hours to police visibility on the A, A and A.

He admits that \"thousands\" of people may lose their jobs in such an event, but he would do it \"with a heavy heart\". This puts the interests of the Conservative Party ahead of those of the nation as a whole. The charade of Brexit began with an attempt to outflank the Faragists and threatens to become an economic disaster. Even now Conservatives of all hues are concerned that failure to deliver a Brexit before the next election will be a disaster ndash for the Conservative Party.Meanwhile a bidding war is taking place to spend Philip Hammondrsquos war chest to cushion Brexit on all sorts of pork barrel promises, mainly to benefit the ageing and wealthy membership of the Conservative Party. Having woken up to the dangers of their Brexit folly for the integrity of the United Kingdom, both seek to cloak themselves in a Union Flag ndash though the bulk of the Conservative electorate place Brexit before the Union.This must come as an extreme embarrassment to Unionists in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Union means far more to them than their English counterparts, despite the rhetoric. Perhaps the time for a reappraisal of the constitutional arrangements of these islands is at hand.Even more embarrassing must be the rhetoric past and present of the front-runner, Boris Johnson. Past references to \"verminous\" Scots have been brushed under that carpet, as have taunts that a pound spent in Scotland was less effective than a pound spent in south-east England ndash which must be why so much is spent on the south-east. Mr Johnson now says that as the next Prime Minister he would style himself also as \"Minister for the Union\" though most of that seems to involve bashing the SNP rather than addressing the deep inequalities in the UK.

And Scotlands decision to remain within the European Union has been positively ignored since the EU referendum in  by politicians who have the cheek to talk about delivering democracy.If David Cameron had accepted Nicola Sturgeons proposal that the UK would only leave the EUall four nations voted to do so, Scotland would be in a far more positive position than our current prospect of being hauled over the edge of the hard Brexit clf we positively never voted for.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE actions by the Brexit Party leader and his stooges in facing the wall during the EU anthem is surely the final insult that these obsequious iniduals can render to us here in Scotland.They do not represent Scotland and Scots who voted to remain in the EU. No doubt, our EU friends will be glad to see them gone after Brexit, but the final irony would surely beArticle  were revoked and these nasties would have to continue.However, the EUrsquos representatives, in particular Joseacute Manuel Barroso, former President of the European Commission and an Anglophile, must be squirming now having been led by the nose by David Cameron to attack us during the independence referendum and support Better Together. How they and he must feel now to see that Better Together has brought about a scenario where Scotlandrsquos definitive vote to remain in the EU has been thwarted. So now you can start to stand up for Europositive Scotland.The EU must ensure now that Scotland is fast-tracked into membership when the UK of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ceases to exist. In fact, as other nations from the formerYugoslavia and Czechs and Slovaks who separated from Czechoslovakia, were admitted, there is no reason now to consider the UK sacrosanct as the English and Welsh vote took the UK out.

Were going to have Brexit, weve the social care system...weve got huge economic priorities that are going to have to be addressed so that wouldnt be where Id focus my energies.\"During a campaign visit in Yorkshire, Mr Johnson side-stepped the fox-hunting issue, saying his priority was to ldquoget Brexit done on October , to do everything I can to unite our countryhellipand then get our party ready to defeat Jeremy Corbyn.\"On social care south of the border, Mr Hunt set out a four-point plan, which would be explained in detail in a Green Paper to be published in his first  days in office. This would include a -year funding plan aligned with the -year plan he negotiated for the NHS, including additional state funding for local councils from the pound billion of fiscal headroom available.On the stump in Yorkshire, Mr Johnson said he too would immediately start work on social care reforms and set out two key principles, which were ldquono-one should face eviction from their home to pay for the cost of their care and everybodys got to have dignity and security in old age.Last night, at hustings in the county, the former London Mayor said he too would put the Union before Brexit but argued no Scottish voter would be able to support a UK government that did not push through Brexit after being asked to in the  referendum.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmA funding workshop aimed at small charities and community groups in Orkney is set to take place on Friday, July .

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course.

And of course, on one level, it is. However, on another, it is, for me, a time of deep frustration and disappointment that it had to come to this.This was not a leadership election I wanted. Over the past seven months, I have gotten to know Theresa May very well. In my view, no one has striven harder, nor demonstrated a greater commitment to the role of our Prime Minister than her. I firmly believe that the country’s best interests would be served by her continuing as Prime Minister. But we are where we are.Serving as an MP is a huge privilege, but it comes with huge responsibilities. Not least because, in times like these, it is the MPs who narrow the possible candidates for Prime Minister down to the final two and then, as members of the wider Conservative Party, vote for which one we want to see in Number .Initially, I backed Matt Hancock for the role. I saw in Matt the enthusiasm, drive and commitment to our country that is needed by a Prime Minister. He also espoused the socially liberal, One Nation policies that I think we need to ownwe are going to appeal to a new generation of voter, across the UK.It was therefore disappointing when Matt decided to withdraw from the competition. I took a few days to reflect on the situation we are in regarding Brexit and to consider who was best suited to getting us out of the impasse we are in. Who had the proven record to deliver as Prime Minister, see us through Brexit and restore the confidence of the British public- especially those who across the UKhave started to lose faith in the centre-right and are turning to the narrow nationalist populism of the Brexit Party and the SNP I concluded that the only person who can deliver this is Boris Johnson. This came as a surprise to many of my friends both within and without politics. But the fact is there is a howling gale of nationalism and populism, whipped up by leaders like Farage and Sturgeon, battering on the door of Westminster, attempting to break in, destroy our politics and our union forever and fundamentally alter the very understanding of who we are as a nation.We simply cannot allow ourselves to be indulge in fantasies of ‘what might have been’, but instead must fight on what the facts are. And the fact is simply this - we have a small window to deliver Brexit and Boris is, in my view, the only person that is capable of getting a Brexit deal through Parliament, neutering the threat posed to our politics and our union by the Brexit Party and the SNP and moving on to take on the other challenges facing our country.Attending cabinet with Theresa May, I have been lucky to get to know and see nearly all the candidates at work, to hear their contributions and ideas. I believe any of the candidates in the final five, would make excellent Prime Ministers, particularly Jeremy Hunt, Rory Stewart and Michael Gove. It is my view that they should all be front and centre of our next Government- taking the fight to Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP. The election really has brought out the best in our party and I’m glad it has been a positive one with genuine, new ideas. In normal times, choosing between the candidates would have proved almost impossible.But these are not normal times. Sothe Party membership chooses Boris Johnson , it is crucial that MPs from across the party unite behind him, so that those of us like myself on the One Nation wing can hold him to his promises to govern as a consensual, modern conservative who will support business and govern for the whole UK.It is particularly important that Scottish Conservatives are vocal in their support for our next Prime Minister, or we will simply play into the  SNP narrative of having an English Conservative Prime Minister foisted upon Scotland against its will. After all, any Conservative Government will need the support of the  Scottish Conservative MPs in future votes.Boris has a proven record as Mayor of London in delivering real and progressive change. I believe he can do so again as PM. I say this as a Remain voter still unconvinced that Brexit is the solution to all our ills. However, I am first and foremost a democrat and a realist, and we need to deliver on our promises. That’s why I voted three times for the Prime Minister’s deal to leave on the th March.We must all now reflect on how the Conservative Party and the country can come together quickly how we can, ultimately, deliver Brexit,with a deal, and leave the European Union as the British people have demanded we do and go on to ensure that this union, our United Kingdom, endures.• Andrew Bowie is the MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"stefan zweig donna tartt and five other alternatives to usual summer books laura waddell","story":"Writers like Donna Tartt, Elena Ferrante and Stefan Zweig can transport you to a dferent world, writes Laura Waddell.There is a commonly held idea that reading in summer is synonymous with something light and mild, not too demanding or engaging a beach afterthought as insubstantial as froth lapping the shore. But when we think of summer, in the most idyllic sense, our heads fill with colour and warmth. Hazy, dfused circles of heat creeping over snapshots of times past moments of action frozen in time. I don’t want mundane days I want everything in summer to be as full and vibrant as ripe fruit, evenit’s just the extravagant laziness of doing nothing at all to the fullest possible extent.The quintessential summer, in my own mind’s eye, takes the form of one specic picture: sitting on my grandparent’s front steps, eating an ice pole, while the neighbour downstairs gardened and I picked paint off the railing to look at layers of colour underneath. A warm day with the flowers blooming, blue skies and distant lawnmowers, the sweetness in the air of my nana’s roses, suspended in time forever. When my mind wanders, thinking of summer, that moment is always there. I cycle through other scenes: the intention,not necessarily weather-permitting reality, of beer gardens. My papa packing a flask of tea before a day out in the car. Touching the chilly North Sea as a wave comes in. Lying on my back reading, while there’s a breeze blowing in and nothing to do: in a caravan, with the door open and gas stove hiss of tea being made, or rain pattering on the roof. Sometimes I think about being suspended on a plane, with nothing to do but waste away time with a book before stepping out into unfamiliar humidity.: The indignity of modern train travel – Laura Waddell: Fleabag: Priest’s sexual advance has got people talking – Laura WaddellNostalgia is the ultimate Instagram filter, but hope is close behind. When we daydream of the summer we want, we’re not thinking of nothing at all, but of a clearly defined atmosphere, one we want to plunge entirely into, dferent from our everyday lives rather than merely undoing them. Temporarily, we enter alternate reality, whether through memories or hope for how our summer might look. The city itself looks dferent in the sunshine. We rediscover gardens and parks. New ways of being are possible. I walk around looser in my skin, later into the day. We don’t want to drop out of reality entirely – other than a break from everyday chores, tedium, or anxiety – so much as we want to e headfirst into glorious feeling. Sights and sounds, cut crass, chilled wine, and sunshine langour. Summer is intense, in the way that the orange of Aperol spritzes is intense, the smell of lavender is intense, and heat on our brow is intense. Deeper sleeps, longer lies.It’s rarely so idyllic, all of the time. But the best stories, of course, also temporarily take us out of reality and set us down where. And so they are, I feel, the ideal summer reads – like for like. There are some practical considerations. Physically, you’ll probably want a paperback that can be chucked in beach bags or shoved down into a backpack alongside bug spray, water bottles, sandwiches and sunscreen. Books are made for using even an object fetishist like me, who spends a lot of time looking at book cover design, still batters their corners.If I’m travelling I might seek out something set in the destination ahead to double up on discovery. This year, ahead of a pinching-myself lucky work invitation to Vienna to celebrate Bloomsday – books have enabled me to travel to new places, literally as well as figuratively – I dipped back into Austrian author Stefan Zweig’s shorter stories, full of emotion, which often depict longing in settings such as hotel rooms and train stations, reflective of his status as a Jewish intellectual dispersed during the Second World War. His experiences have never felt irrelevant, and his storytelling skills are classic. As I work in the book industry, for summer reading I often choose books I don’t have to review, write about, or recommend in any way. No publication dates looming. A dissolution of everyday demands. It’s a rare, weightless chance to browse shelves without looking for anything in particular, although inevitably, I’ll weigh myself down from trips to bookshops wherever I go.Recently I did an author reading in Shakespeare and Co, the revered, ramshackle, cat-installed English language bookshop in Paris, celebrating the launch of an anthology called We’ll Never Have Paris which invited a sprawling number of writers to depict it as they see fit a theme that emerges is reconciling the Paris of romanticised imagination with the everyday reality. While I was there, I pluckedLauren Groff’s Fates and Furies from a high and tightly packed shelf, a bestseller from a couple of years ago that I’d been meaning to read for ages. It’s a dense and lyrical book exploring one marriage’s successes, sacrices, and hidden rages. While keeping cool from the record-breaking heatwave sweeping Europe, I also read Heartburn by Nora Ephron, a short, sharp satire of eighties New York and Washington society full of wit, humour, and recipes, and Tokyo Ueno Station by Yu Miriwhich shows the city from a rare perspective, that of a homeless labourer asking himself whether years of gruelling work building Olympic stadiums had been worthwhile, capturing the everyday atmosphere of transient camps.In the summer, with more time to wander and get lost, I gravitate towards books that will immerse me in their world some of the very best hazy-dayed reading memories I have include plunging into Donna Tartt’s addictive New England intrigues, Elena Ferrante’s two fists full Napoleon epic that took me through all seasons, and Samanta Schweblin’s eerie Argentinian bio-horror Fever Dream.Each to their own, of course. Wholeheartedly, I believe anyone should read whatever they want, should they choose. But for me, summertime reading will always be something I can travel through, as much as with, taking me to places I don’t yet know or deepening my imagining of those I do, but crucially, upending reality just like a strike of sunlight washing over my face is able to.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow based kilt company to launch world s first vegan tartan","story":"Woven only in animal-free materials, the kilt is designed to celebrate those Scots and tartan enthusiasts from around the world that follow a vegan lestyle.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to.

Calum McAuley, an apprentice with Braid Electrical Services, won ‘Apprentice of the Year’.And Jordan Haggan, apprentice electrician with Alexander Bonar  Co, was highly commended in the same category. They were nominated for the accolade alongside another three of their College colleagues. The Northern Ireland Electrical Awards, which represent the pinnacle achievement for the electrical industry in Northern Ireland, recognise and reward the achievements of those working in the province’s erse electrical sector. Organised by the Electrical Magazine and judged by an independent  of respected industry experts, the awards collectively recognise the achievements of both companies and iniduals. Sean McAleese, Training Manager at Northern Regional College, said they are thrilled that the hard work and talent of so many of their apprentices are being recognised at these awards.“We have worked closely with local employers over many years to ensure we are equipping our students with industry-level skills, and these invaluable relationships help us to ensure our students receive training at the very highest level,” he said.Apprentice of the Year Calum, who is currently enrolled on a Level  electrical installation programme, said he always wanted to be an electrician.“I’ve always tried, both in College and on-site, to achieve the very highest standards, in everything I do,” said Calum. “It’s great to have all that hard work and effort recognised with an award like this one.”Jordan Haggan, , said from the outset of his career he spent a lot of time working alongside electricians.“But it took me a while to make the leap of faith and pursue it as a career myself.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"balmoral master chef provides boost for guide dogs ni","story":"WITH entries for the Balmoral Hotel’s Master*Chef compet-ition drawing to a close on Friday, the competition to find Ireland’s next top chef could also have a positive lasting impact on the work of its charity partner, Guide Dogs NI.Through their efforts, Guide Dogs NI help change the way sight loss affects people’s lives by ensuring that they can get out and about on their own terms. This involves tireless campaigning, fundraising, and, of course, as Guide Dogs NI Engagement Officer, Hannah Lyons explains, the support of iniduals and businesses such as the Balmoral Hotel on the Blacks Road.“It’s wonderful that the Balmoral Hotel have chosen us as their charity partners,” she says.“We are really excited for the upcoming Master*Chef. Fundraising is integral to all of the work that we do. It costs around £, to support a guide dog from birth to retirement. We cover their whole working le as a guide dog including the cost of their food and ongoing training. “Guide dogs are le changing, but there is a lot of work involved in it, so it is essential to have the support from iniduals or organisations like the Balmoral.”As well as raising funds, the Master*Chef competition will also help raise awareness of the work Guide Dogs NI do and inform people of some of struggles faced by the visually impaired.“Our ambition is for a future where everybody with sight loss has the confidence and support to live their lives to the full,” Hannah explains. “A big part of it is access to and experience of services such as shops, bars, hotels and restaurants. We talk about the ‘purple pound’, which is the spending power of anybody living with a disability. We always say that it shouldn’t be underestimated. If someone living with sight loss has a positive experience when they are out and about with any service provider then they are going towith their loyalty and spending power.“We’re quite fortunate here in Northern Irelandthat businesses are supportive on the whole, but we just need to keep that message current and keep it at the forefront of people’s mind. Businesses need to be actively welcoming visitors with disabilities because it isn’t just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense.”While there is still plenty of work to be done in making the North of Ireland disability friendly, Guide Dogs NI have helped drive through some vital changes. “We’re somewhat dferent to our counterparts across the water because they’re still campaigning on some of the things that we already have such as audiovisual on buses and disability awareness training for taxi drivers here,” Hannah says.“We have those things in place, so we are lucky in that respect. One of the big things we’re working on at the minute is our pavement parking campaign. Parking is a problem throughout the country but because of rising congestion levels it’s getting worse. It can really negatively impact on somebody’s day when someone un-thoughtfully abandons their car and that visually impaired person then has to turn back or make the decisionthey should walk into the road to complete their journey. That’s a level of stress and anxiety that nobody should have to deal with.”Training guide dogs is, of course, a key part of the charity’s work, but they are now asking for volunteers to become sighted guides for people with visual impairment. “A guide dog sometimes isn’t for everyone and that’s why My Guide is our free service that enables people with a vision impairment to get out of their homes and into the community,” Hannah explains.“With a volunteer as their sighted guide, they can overcome challenges presented by unfamiliar places or crowded areas, enjoy exploring and becoming involved in their local communities and ultimately become more independent. “We provide all the volunteer trainingand ask for a commitment of a few hours once a week to help someone with a visual impairment to get out and about. There are people located across the whole of Northern Ireland currently waiting for a volunteer and it is truly such a rewarding role to take on.”If anyone is interested becoming a sited guide or wants to find out more, they can get in touch with the Guide Dogs NI team at Belfast@guidedogs.org.ukThe Master*Chef grand finale will take place as part of Féile an Phobail at the Balmoral Hotel on Wednesday th of August .For more information, see: balmoralhotelbelfast pro-masterchef"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screenshot-2019-07-02-at-11.22.45.png","title":"meet aaron flanagan","story":"In , Aaron Flanagan and his brother quit their ‘proper jobs’ to open Comic Book Guys, Northern Ireland#s largest independent comic book store and the first-ever authorised CGC dealer.The one-stop shop located on Great VIctoria Street has been serving Belfast’s thriving comic book scene through golden, silver age, bronze to modern comics, movie memorabilia, toys, collectables and even comics made by local creators .In this week’s conversation, we chat all about serving a small market, the impact superhero movies have had on the industry, what it’s like to set up your own business and why a vintage medium like comic books are still thriving today.Check it out.

The leaders of EU institutions are supposed to impartially represent the interests of all member nations globally and in Brussels.Some leaders discussed the roster of upcoming vacancies, which also include the EU’s top diplomat, the president of the European Parliament and the chief of the European Central Bank , on the sidelines of the Group of  summit in Japan that concluded on Saturday.Mr Tusk wants nominations to be wrapped up soon, seeking to prevent further erosion of public confidence in the EU amid Brexit uncertainty and intra-bloc isions over managing migration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Council president Donald Tusk, left, with Renew Europe party member Guy Verhofstadt There was hope at the previous summit on June - that more time would clary who should replace Mr Juncker.

The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia.

He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"house commons told derrys city deal dependent restoration stormont","story":"The implementation of Derry’s City Deal is dependent on the re-establishment of government in Northern Ireland, the House of Commons was told yesterday.During questions to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, MPs sought more detail around a timeline for delivering City Deal projects.Labour MP Mike Amesbury, Shadow Minister for Employment, asked what comparative assessment she has made of the scope of city deals in Northern Ireland His question was answered by John Penrose MP, Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, who said: “In line with our  manesto commitment, we have already announced two city deals in Northern Ireland, £m for Belfast and a combined package of £m for Derry and Strabane.“Early stage discussions have also begun with other councils in the mid-south and west and Causeway Coast and Glens.”Addressing the House, Mr Amesbury recalled a recent visit to the “wonderful city of Derry” where he spoke with those shaping the education offer, adding, “they told me that a central aspect of the City Deal is the establishment of a riverfront university, medical centre and innovation hub.“Could the minister update the house on the timeline of progress of this much-needed facility ”He was told that the timeline of that is “the same as the timeline in the rest of the City Deal, which is that business cases have to be worked up, as business cases clearly for all the projects in it have to work well.“There are incidentally for any business cases that don’t shape up, many, many other ideas which can also be brought through and they will then get approved and will then proceed.”Before he got an opportunity to finish answering the question, The Speaker called Belfast MP Emma Little Pengelly forward who pressed him about progress on the Belfast City Deal.The DUP MP asked for detail around discussions with the head of the civil service and city council about getting those projects to implementation and when he anticipated the first project will be rolled out.“The dficulty here is that City Deals are a local initiative, we can only lay foundations but they need to be taken forward both by the local partners and local councils, but also ultimately, as soon as we get the Stormont Executive re-established they have to have a central role in this.“So, while we are making progress as fast as we decently can, and so are the local councils, we are ultimately also dependent on the progress of the talks,” Mr Penrose concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"psni carry search derry relation new ira activity","story":"Police in Derry have said they have carried out a search of a building site in the city this morning in connection to the activities of the New IRA.The PSNI say that detectives from the Terrorism Investigation Unit conducted the search at Clon Dara in the Skeoge district as part of an ongoing investigation into violent dissident republicanism.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshDetective Chief Inspector Stuart Grfin said: “Today’s search operation was carefully planned to cause the least disruption to the local community and was carried out by officers investigating the activities of the New IRA.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

Both batsmen set about the task in a positive manner with Campbell especially hitting out.Lindsay was eventually bowled for  runs and that brought Conor Moag to the wicket, scoring a quick seven, getting out to a good catch.

That is why we have arranged tonightrsquos meeting and I hope it will be well supported by the people of Downpatrick, across the district and further afield.Mr Morgan claimed many people he has spoken to want change and have an appetite for a new Assembly comprising independent members, not established political party representatives.He continued: ldquoTonightrsquos meeting is the next stage in the campaign and we are approaching this on a county by county basis.

He also pointed out that gold was more common in Ireland during the Bronze Age than in most other parts of Europe.The jury concluded that the fastener had been intentionally hidden or concealed and therefore declared it treasure trove.Although young Elizabeth is likely to receive compensation for discovering the fastener, the coroner ruled that it becomes the property of the Queen and will be handed over to the Treasury.ARDGLASS mdash A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded on a  year-old man whose body was found washed up at Ardglass in February this year after the boat on which he was fishing sank.An inquest jury at Downpatrick on Thursday heard how James Edward Greer, of Elmfield Park, Donaghadee, had been held up in the water for about  minutes by his skipper, who eventually had to let go of him.The badly decomposed body of Mr Greer, who could not swim, was washed up at Sheepland Begg on February .The skipper of the boat said he held the deceased for about five minutes after their vessel was hit by a big wave off Peel in the Isle of Man.He tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but Mr Greer was unconscious and after another ten minutes he had to get him go because he himself was in danger.

The long range forecast reckons that the warm, dry spell may continue.BALLYGOWAN mdash Two hundred workers at the ropeworks factory in Ballygowan will lose their jobs within the next three months.A spokesman for the Belfast Ropeworks Company Ltd, the owners of the factory, says that heavy losses have been sustained in recent years and therefore all production will have to be brought to a halt.The workers, both male and female, will be declared redundant during the course of the next  weeks. The marking and selling activities of the company will be unaffected and customers will continue to be supplied.The company spokesman said he regretted that it had become necessary to cease the manufacture of rope and twine products and carpet fibre at the local factory.ldquoThe cost of production at Ballygowan has consistently exceeded what the market can bear, while the remoteness of the factory from its principal market in Great Britain imposes a further burden in respect of prohibitive transport costs, particularly for finished goods, he added.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrick Young Farmers had a very successful day at the th annual Young Farmersrsquo county rally on Saturday. Out of the  clubs Downpatrick gained maximum points to won both the Farm Tasks Shield and the Rally Shield.Overall, the club achieved a high number of placings, including a second from Pat Turley in weed identication and a first from Vincent MacNabb in soil assessment.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Energy has no future plans to use Strangford Lough as an experiment centre in the battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.More than  months ago scientists gained valuable information for a sea trial buoy which was built at the marine biology station in Portaferry and nearby at Marffield Bay.A Department of Energy official has informed the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, that no further tests at Strangford Lough are planned at present.The official was answering a question raised by Mr Powell in the House of Commons asking whether the Department had taken into account the experiments in the lough.During the experiments scientists monitored radio signals from the buoy which experienced a wide range of weather conditions during a one-month period.The device was small scale, but it gave scientists enough information to produced a design for a full scale device. It is thought that a chain of such buoys could one day be one of our main sources of power..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Irish Street open again after three month delay  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS Irish Street finally reopened to two-way traffic last weekend after a protracted environmental improvement scheme took twice as long to complete than originally planned.Contractors removed barriers to allow the flow of two-way traffic on Friday evening but traffic lights at the Market Street junction mdash which were permanently on red during work on the pound, public realm project mdash were not adjusted.Motorists arriving at the bottom of the street were left confused and had to carefully ease across the busy junction and while the traffic lights remained stuck on red the following morning, they were finally adjusted.The street is scheduled to be closed to all traffic this weekend as the final touches are put to the environmental scheme which will see the road between the Market Street and John Street junctions resurfaced.The Department for Infrastructure, which managed the scheme on behalf of the Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council, has admitted that the delayed public realm scheme had a ldquonegative impact on trading across the town.In addition, government officials also conceded that more should have been done to keep the business community affected by the overrunning project better informed.In May, business owners and traders took part in a protest at the delay in completing the environmental revamp to provide new granite paving, street lighting and furniture. The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated. Lessons have surely been learned and keeping people better informed must be the priority.ldquoThe Collinsrsquo Corner upgrade is vital and I hope that once this scheme has been completed a lsquoserious lookrsquo will be taken at addressing the congestion problem in nearby Edward Street which is a major health and safety issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Lynch excels at Spelga race  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ACrsquos Seamus Lynch won race seven of the NIMRA Championship, which took place at Spelga Dam on Saturday,, the aptly named Spelga Skyline.Typical Mourne weather of passing showers and fog did not deter the  entries.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a shamrock, suggesting that they could perhaps be offered the chance of being awarded this or a poppy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New civic amenity centre set to open in Downpatrick  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new civic amenity centre is scheduled to open later this month.The new site at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town will replace the nearby Cloonagh Road facility which has been struggling for some time to keep pace with increasing demand.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is building the new centre which is larger than the current facility and will be able to handle considerably more waste.

But this year’s event will be an outdoor concert in the amphitheatre on Kerr Street featuring just six guest bands.In a statement posted on Facebook, the host band said it took the decision to change its event this year following “months of talks with the Causeway Coast and Glens Council, PSNI, RA and Translink.”It said its usual parade was “simply not possible this year”, but said it will use the concert “to show all those who will be visiting for The Open what our culture is all about.”Voicing his support for the band and the event, Mr Carlisle said: “Whilst the event in Portrush has not been organised by the Orange Institution, we commend the local band for their willingness to adapt their annual event in order to not only minimise disruption, but also to allow visitors to enjoy the very best local bands in an open-air concert.”Stressing that “marching bands are an important integral aspect of the musical le of Northern Ireland”, he revealed the Orange Institution has sent a complaint about the article to .Milton Keynes Hospital wards are so hot it is putting patients health at risk say staff Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -

Letter to the editorHer posters re-traumatise victims of Provisional Sinn Fein Provisional IRAon a daily basis — and by the way they were still up last week in the greater Lisburn area. When proud, unrepentant, convicted terrorists come on TV lecturing us on human rights, equality, integrity and respect, they re-traumatise their victims and the countless PSF PIRA terrorism on a daily basis. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p I would also stress that every decent Catholic who votes for PSF PIRA candidates, when other decent candidates are available, are also re-traumatisingcountless victims of PSF PIRA and dancing on the graves of those murdered by them, including Jean McConville, Colomba McVeigh and Patsy Gillespie.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There has been criticism of the decision not to reveal who will be Archiersquos godparents and speculation is re Meghanrsquos best friend, the Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney, will be chosen while Harryrsquos old schoolmates, brothers Thomas and Charlie van Straubenzee, could be picked.But tennis star Serena Williams ruled herself out on Thursday night after Meghan watched her play at Wimbledon, saying she will be working on Saturday.Mr Borkowski said about Harry and Meghanrsquos decision to keep the christening private: ldquoThis is what yoursquod expect a Hollywood A-lister to do, purposefully be sort of antagonist to the traditional system and not engaging with media in any shape or form.ldquoAnd this is certainly a declaration that theyrsquoll go to any s to protect their privacy and not engage with publicity. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have decided to exclude the press  --He said any ldquoinsight into their lives would be denied because ldquowhen there comes a moment when there is an issue, of maybe invasion of privacy, they have a very firm defence about their non-engagement with the media, in all shapes and forms, about their private le.The PR expert added: ldquoAnd something as gentle as announcing a godparent, they are down on it immediately.However, it is understood to protect the privacy of the godparents, who are thought to be private iniduals and not public figures, their names are not being released.There is also the view that as Archie is seventh in line to the throne, and unlikely to be a full-time royal but have a career like the Queenrsquos granddaughter Zara Tindall, he should be afforded some privacy while growing up.Normally under the Parochial Registers and Records Measure  the names of godparents are publicly listed.A spokesman for the Church of England said: ldquoUnder the Parochial Registers and Records Measure  all baptisms must be registered and the record made is normally publicly available for searches and for the making of certied copies of entries.ldquoHowever the register to be used in this case is held privately by the royal household on behalf of the Crown and we understand that it has never complied with the usual requirement.The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will perform the baptism of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor in front of the family and close friends of Harry and Meghan in the private chapel at the Queenrsquos Berkshire home.It is understood the Queen will not be attending the christening, as she has a prior engagement, but the other expected guests include the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Meghanrsquos mother Doria Ragland.The Sussexes have once again turned to fashion photographer Chris Allerton, who took their wedding photographs, to capture the moment on Saturday.Some of Mr Allertonrsquos pictures will be released following the ceremony..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Harry and Meghan  uacting like Hollywood A-listers in keeping baptism private u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

For this project they teamed up with Ballyoran Seniors who are based at Ashgrove Community Centre on the Garvaghy Road.They went on conducted tours of the Boyne Visitors Centre and Drogheda and also to the East Belfast mission to learn of the Celtic origins of the area and also hear Linda Ervine outline her work in Turas, the Irish and Scotch Gaelic school, operating from the Mission’s headquarters at Skainos House on the Newtownards Road.Also a visit to the Oireachtas in Leinster House in Dublin where they had an opportunity to see the Dail and Irish Senate in operation. They were hosted at this event by Senator Ian Marshall, a self-confessed Unionist from Markethill who gave an enlightened viewpoint in his role in the Senate. Joe Garvey, Chairman of the Association said: “Many of us were taught little about Irish History or how our cultures came to be developed. Often people only learn a narrow aspect of history. The objective of this project, like previous ones, was to give a broader perspective on our backgrounds and how all the communities on this Island can live in harmony and respect each other’s traditions. It was also an opportunity for our two groups to work together for the benefit of our communities and we look forward to sustain the good relations that have been developed.” The Deputy Lord Mayor, Councillor Margaret Tinsley, congratulated Richmount Rural Community Association and Ballyoran Seniors for coming together to develop better community relations.She said: “Embarking on such projects can be challenging and Richmount Rural Community Association must be commended for its efforts in promoting peace and respect in our communities. I am aware that the Association has been leading the way in this field and it is also one of the few locations in the Borough to have a magnicent Peace monument.“It is also noteworthy that the Association has taken its message of peace to work with other communities such as Glenravel in Co Antrim and across the border with Corduff Raferagh in Co Monaghan.“I know the work in peace and reconciliation still has some way to go and I am pleased that Richmount and Ballyoran are currently engaged in Peace IV project on reimaging and shared spaces as it has the desire for the Richmount Centre to be seen as a shared space and welcome to all in the community. I would just encourage you to keep up the good work.”Frances Hayes, Chair of Ballyoran Seniors also commended the Association for taking the initiative.She said: “At the outset we were not sure what we were letting ourselves in for but what we found was a warm welcoming group of people. We are now working together for the mutual benefits of both groups and we have enjoyed embracing the concept of learning about other cultures and the need for mutual respect”.Stunning new £.m youth

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application.

Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
