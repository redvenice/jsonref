And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

It is just wonderful, it looks back to the great drawings of the Renaissance yet it is so incredibly modern and free and spontaneous and direct. It is like you are looking over his shoulder as he is drawing it.”Picasso then 45 and unhappily married, fell for the 17-year-old Walter when he noticed her through the window of Galeries Lafayette in Paris in 1927. “I’m sure we shall do great things together. I’m Picasso,” he said to someone who had not the faintest idea who he was.The chance meeting and subsequent affair was effectively Picasso being reborn, his grandson Olivier Widmaier Picasso has said.She inspired paintings, drawings and sculptures, some of which are considered the greatest works from a career which ned eight decades.A 2018 Picasso exhibition at Tate Modern showed some of the many exhilarating and intense paintings she inspired.The drawing appearing at auction is much more gentle and intimate. A testament of its personal importance is that Picasso kept it until his death, after which it passed to his son Bernard. It was bought by its present owner in 1986 and has not been seen nor publicly exhibited since.Picasso’s 1932 Walter-inspired paintings have often attracted stratospheric prices. In 2010, Nude, Green Leaves and Bust sold for £66m while Le Rêve was bought for £103m by hedge fund manager Steven A Cohen from casino mogul Steve Wynn.The new Picasso, titled Femme endormie, 1931, will be sold in a Sotheby’s evening sale on 28 July and has an estimate of £6m-£9m.It is part of a private collection, accumulated over 40 years, of works that tell the story of 20th century European avant-garde art.Sotheby’s called it a treasure trove. It is also selling works from the collection by artists including Wassily Kandinsky, Lyonel Feininger, Alberto Giacometti, Marc Chagall, August Macke and Jean Arp.One of the standouts is an important cubist work by Fernand Léger, Nature morte, 1914, which has an estimate of £8-£12m and has not been seen since it was purchased in 1984."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5da9191922b96932b8937be9b56ebc774e39602/0_315_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff01a5a066f55cce5adfdb5b589e6f0e","title":"daily life is deeply magical images from openwalls arles 2020 in pictures","story":"Supernatural grandmothers and a family of 13 living on a boat were among the subjects that caught the eye of the prestigious photography award’s judges"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f46a255ee4555d660c787f247eba1c32b6dac095/0_0_4837_2904/master/4837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946d4b0c6928df007f9112290f6a6d20","title":"im the first black author to win book of the year im proud but not completely happy","story":"Instead of celebrating myself, I’m going to celebrate the books by black authors that came before meI have a funny thing about winning. I find it overwhelming. I don’t know how to cope or act when things are meant to be “good”. What do I do? Should I be happy? What is that? How many ways can I genuinely and meaningfully thank people who congratulate me? Do they understand that if I don’t reply to their kind messages, I’m not being rude – it’s just that I don’t know what to say?It’s not that I’m not grateful when things go well, it’s more that I need to talk to a therapist about them. Anyway, imagine my discomfort when I was told that my book Queenie had won debut of the year at the British Book awards. Actually, my first feeling was relief that instead of having to attend a ceremony and have my picture taken, and get up on a stage and be looked at, I could just pre-record an acceptance speech on Zoom then go back to watching music videos all day.Still, I was so nervous staring back at myself on screen that I forgot to thank my family and friends. And then, imagine my terror when I was told, on the same Zoom call, that Queenie had also been awarded book of the year. Book of the Whole Year. Wild. I asked the person who told me to repeat what they’d said, more than once.I know how these prizes are meant to work. Having been in the industry for a while, and with the help of Wikipedia, I knew that no black woman, or indeed black person, has won that prize since the awards were started in 1994. Ever. So apparently, in the last 26 years, there has been no book by a black author seen to be deserving of that prize. I’m not downplaying my novel, I’m mainly proud of it, but still, I can’t feel completely happy about how things have gone.In my second acceptance speech I ended up saying how sad it was that it had taken so long not just for a book like Queenie to be published, but to be given such attention in the industry and in the literary world. The last written words in the novel are #BlackLivesMatter, and it felt important for me to remind the overwhelmingly white publishing industry of this, especially at this time of great change and heightened awareness.I’m hopeful, though, that my win marks a change and, more importantly, longstanding and sustainable change. Because, the playing field needs to be levelled. It needed to be levelled a long time ago. So instead of celebrating myself, I’m going to celebrate the books by black authors that came before me, that deserved just as much attention. The ones that deserved to be book of the year. I’m going to celebrate the books by black authors that weren’t published prominently enough, that didn’t make it to print, and the ones that didn’t even make it on to the page for fear that they weren’t good enough. I’m hopeful that this award can show black writers who haven’t yet had the confidence to even submit their novel that they can be winners too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16c1d606367a190e8a721efafe3a4d7527592689/10_73_2223_1334/master/2223.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0efc65560d196037e1e4f9932679eb0","title":"paying the land by joe sacco review ","story":"The painful history of the Northwestern Territory’s indigenous people takes the celebrated cartoonist away from AK47s and mortar shells, and into a different kind of warThere is a moment, in his 2003 collection Notes from a Defeatist, when you can see Joe Sacco finding out exactly what he was meant to do. The pieces have been competent enough so far – satires of office grunts and nerdy librarians, of a “cartoon genius” trying not very hard not to sell out exercises in a familiar kind of knowing autobiographical bathos. And then he interviews his mother.Carmen Sacco grew up in Malta, and was a child when Mussolini went to war in Abyssinia, bombing the highlands and gassing civilians the Maltese, fully expecting to be next, bought gas masks and drilled for raids. In the event, bombing began five years later Joe, who was born in Malta but grew up in Australia, tells his mother’s story from her point of view. In one series of drawings, Carmen, walking home from school, is caught alone on a country road, and strafed by a Messerschmitt the reader is down on the ground with her, next to the sole of her shoe, looking past her torso, past her head, up to the empty sky above the empty road – empty, that is, except for the plane, turning to come back. It is a triumph of empathy, of detail, of perspective. Sacco went on, of course, to draw years’ and books’-worth of nightmares: Palestine, Safe Area Goražde, The Fixer (also about Bosnia), Footnotes in Gaza, stories of refugees trying to reach Malta, or about the war in Iraq a 24ft, wordless depiction of the first day of the battle of the Somme. His comics have earned him comparisons to Hogarth, Art Spiegelman and Robert Crumb he himself includes among his influences Goya and Breughel, the Orwell of Animal Farm, Voltaire’s Candide, and Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, but these are so present he almost doesn’t need to say it.Paying the Land could not, at first glance, be more different. The first page is a serene view of a man and his dogs gazing out on to snowy, moonlit woods. The next pages are busier, but also pastoral – a baby, a boat, people hunting and fishing, an elderly man smoking a pipe. Sacco, who pays attention to every face, every squelch of mud or crumpled cigarette packet, has always had the most astonishing sense of place. You can smell rock and pine and snow, feel it in your bones. The bucolic scene turns out to be the reconstructed childhood of Paul Andrew, a chief of the Shúhtaot’ine, or Mountain Dene, and in the visual layering of that memory with his much less idyllic present is the story of Canada – told, as Edward Said put it in his introduction to Palestine, from the point of view of “history’s losers”.When Charles II handed what is now the Northwest Territories over to the Hudson’s Bay Company, no one thought to tell the Metis and the Dene. Canadian fur clothed the fashionable of Europe and made the company rich, but, apart from the small matter of land ownership, the arrangement was mutually beneficial. Then in the late 1800s oil was found, and gold, and “the Dominion extended its control not by the slaughter that defined the white race south of the national border, but clinically, methodically, and administratively – through treaties.” These treaties required the Dene and Metis to “cede, release, surrender and yield … their rights, title, privileges … for $5 a year, for some bullets and fishnets”, a baffling exchange until one considers the Dene attitude to land, which is that it cannot be owned. The exploitation has continued in various forms ever since, as Sacco – who draws himself into his cartoons as a blank-spectacled questioner – knows: “After all, what’s the difference between me and an oil company? We’ve both come to extract something.”And he’s well aware the pain here runs deep. “Dear Reader,” he writes, about 100 pages in, in small squares floating above stony mountains, “something has been circling above these stories, in fact, haunting this entire project. Perhaps I should have mentioned it before …” And then the pages go whiter still, tall panels forming a blank triptych above a rocky riverbed, as a tiny plane banks and enters, page-right, to land. When it takes off, Paul Andrew, then a child of eight, has gone with it. For 120 years, until the mid-1990s, indigenous children were taken from their families to residential boarding schools run for the government by Catholic nuns. Their heads were shaved, and they became numbers rather than names the aim was to educate the “Indian” out of them.The question that drives Paying the Land is what do you do? How do you break the dependencies – on oil and natural gas (the ninth largest reserves in the world), on alcohol, on welfare, on an external definition of who you are? Straight compensation and apology is a minimum, and a truth and reconciliation process admitted cultural genocide in 2015, but an influx of cash can be a death sentence to a serious alcoholic. And how do you deal with inevitable change? Nostalgia is no answer “People have to eat. They need roads and schools,” as one chief, who would dearly like to return his people to subsistence on the land, eventually has to admit. The eternal question about climate change and “progress” applies here too – what is the moral position of denying people things you have already enjoyed yourself, in order to fix the damage that was no fault of theirs? Again and again Sacco finds that “it’s more complicated than that”.There isn’t quite the level of immersion here as there has been in previous books, when Sacco lived with ordinary Bosnians and Palestinians he doesn’t manage to stay with any Dene, and his interviewees are mostly leaders of one stripe or another, which sometimes lends a talking-heads, outside-in quality to the oral history. It isn’t always easy to keep track of who’s who, which I suspect, given the odd prod – “you remember him” – is a problem he’s aware of. Previous books made me uncomfortable about his portrayal of women – “silly girls” in Gorazde, or the drunks who “offered me the town slut” there are more women here than usual, and he is alert to the ways in which Dene gender politics (now interestingly at odds with their own history, when everyone was required to be equally capable, at everything) gets in the way of their female leaders. But I think he could have gone further, and talked to more women, especially about their day to day challenges done what he did with his mother, perhaps, and in so doing made the experience more immediate.Paying the Land is still a powerful piece of work, however, and in this time of pandemic and race protests Sacco’s concern with the decimation caused by injustice and internalised ideas of inferiority with how the system is “built for capitalism to succeed, not humans”, resonates even more than it already would have. And over it all, of course, is the issue of our relationship to nature. When you take something from the land, when you kill a moose, or fell a tree, an elderly Dene tells Sacco, you “pray … and you give it something … a bullet, perhaps, water, tobacco, tea”. What is the worldview, Sacco asks, after he is proudly shown the ingenious ways in which oil companies corral the byproducts of fracking, “of a people who mumble no thanks or prayers, who take what they want from the land, and pay it back in arsenic?”• Paying the Land is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).

One holds that the latest US unemployment report will give a crucial insight into the state of America’s economic recovery. That would show that firms are getting back to work, heralding a rapid recovery from the Covid-19 recession.As Stephen Innes of AxiCorp puts it:I do not think we can overemphasize the importance of Thursday’s NFP bridging the disconnect between improving cyclical data (i.e., PMIs) and a lackluster medium-to-long-term economic prognosis as persistently negative yields would lead one to believe. A better-than-expected outcome could go some way to settling the near-term debate that the US labor market will heal relatively quickly and justify new highs in US equities.But there’s another view -- that the worrying spike in coronavirus cases across America in recent days means June’s NFP could already be dated. Overnight, 50,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday, a new record high.More than half of new U.S. cases each day are in Arizona, California, Florida and Texas, forcing those states to shutter some non-essential businesses again, undermining the economic recovery in a bid to safe lives.California governor Gavin Newsom ordered bars to close and banned indoor dining in many parts of the state, saying:The bottom line is the spread of this virus continues at a rate that is particularly concerning,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, fears some parts of the US economy are going into reverse:Either way, June’s Non-Farm Payroll will probably be the biggest story in the markets today. It normally comes on a Friday, but has been brought forwards because Friday is a US holiday (for the 4th July celebrations).Potentially confusingly, we also get the latest weekly US unemployment figures today - they’re expected to show that another 1.3m people signed on for jobless support last week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f0465b26bb5babdb3d98eb8a6ad9edc71108a7/0_79_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5274373936ac645ed5459f7b5991e0a5","title":"england privatised water firms dividends shareholders","story":"Critics say utilities borrowing to pay shareholders instead of improving infrastructure English water companies have handed more than £2bn a year on average to shareholders since they were privatised three decades ago, according to analysis for the .The payouts in idends to shareholders of parent companies between 1991 and 2019 amount to £57bn – nearly half the sum they spent on maintaining and improving the country’s pipes and treatment plants in that period.Critics say while continuing to pay huge idends they have failed to carry out significant national infrastructure works to improve the water and sewerage system.When Margaret Thatcher sold off the water industry in 1989, the government wrote off all debts.

But since the revenue from user charges covered capital expenditure, this debt has been used to finance idends rather than capital expenditure,” Hall said.Ownership: consortium of international investment fundsOwnership: publicly listed on the London stock exchangeOwnership: privately owned, through a series of holding companies, by Greensands HoldingsOwnership: Pennon Group, a British plc publicly listed on the London Stock ExchangeOwnership: consortium of institutional investors including funds from China and Abu DhabiHighest paid director: £985,000, Brandon Rennet, CFO and executive directorOwnership: a British plc listed on the London Stock ExchangeIn comparison, the highest paid director of publicly owned Scottish Water earned £366,000.Ellen Lees of the campaign group We Own It said: “Rather than paying out billions to shareholders, the water companies could have been investing in the infrastructure the system needs,” she said.“It’s time to put an end to this farce that is ripping off the public and ruining our environment. It’s time to bring our water into public ownership.”The performance of the water companies in England has been criticised by the Environment Agency. In the latest assessment, Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the agency, described the firms’ performance in 2018 as “simply unacceptable”.Rather than improving, it had deteriorated, with more serious pollution incidents that damaged wildlife, the local environment and in the worst cases public health, she said.Howard Boyd said nothing she had seen last year suggested any of the companies were making significant improvements. The performance assessment for 2019 is due in July.Dieter Helm, a professor of economic policy at Oxford University, said water companies could not be blamed for exploiting the system.“The water companies behaved exactly how we believe a commercial company does behave,” he said. “The question is, do we expect capitalists to behave like capitalists? What we have seen is a complete regulatory failure to control the companies.”The industry regulator, Ofwat, has recently challenged the water companies on their idend policies.Anglian Water said it was incorrect to say debt was being used to pay idends. “Financing though debt is the most cost-effective and legitimate way to fund new infrastructure. Customers benefit: bills are cheaper. This is why we do it.”It said investors had not taken a idend payment since 2018. However, according to the company’s annual report, idends totalling £67.8m were paid in the financial year to the end of March 2019.When the sewer system is operating normally, sewage leaves homes and businesses and is treated at a treatment works. Only when it has been treated is wastewater released to the environment, either out to sea through long outfalls or coastal discharges, or into rivers.The vast majority of England’s sewer network is a combined system, which dates back to Victorian engineering, and is designed to collect the contents of people’s toilets and surface rainwater then transfer them together to treatment plants.After extreme rainfall, the treatment works cannot cope with the volume of water and untreated sewage. Human excrement, condoms, sanitary towels and toilet paper are released untreated into rivers through combined sewer overflow pipes – just as it was in 19th-century London.These pipes are supposed to be a safety valve to release pressure in the system and used only when an exceptionally large amount of water enters the system.Thames Water said its shareholders were in it for the long term and had not taken a idend payment for three years. “We invested more than £1bn again in 2019-20, leading to a total of £15bn in the past 15 years.“We will continue to spend wisely on improving resilience, service and efficiency, as well as provide more support for customers in vulnerable circumstances.”An Ofwat spokesperson said: “Over the past few years, we have challenged how companies approach their decisions on idends. We expect companies to have strong governance arrangements and to be fully transparent about how idends reflect delivery of obligations and commitments to customers and the environment.” • Statements from the water companies can be read in full here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25004f4e240ddf6f062920f27c5b018584ce21a2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801cd452f0d65bd2f8ab77975b66692f","title":"water firms raw sewage england rivers","story":"Untreated effluent flowed into waterways for more than 1.5m hours, data showsWater companies in England discharged raw sewage into rivers on more than 200,000 occasions last year, according to data obtained by the .The analysis reveals untreated human waste was released into streams and rivers for more than 1.5m hours in 2019.The figures, obtained via environmental information requests, trace releases of sewage from storm drains in rivers across England by all nine water companies and provide a comprehensive picture of the scale of pollution from what critics say is the routine dumping of untreated sewage.Popular English rivers including the Thames, the Windrush, which runs through the Cotswolds and Oxfordshire, the River Chess, a chalk stream in Buckinghamshire, the Avon in Bristol, the Severn, and the River Wharfe in Ilkley are among the many affected.When the sewer system is operating normally, sewage leaves homes and businesses and is treated at a treatment works.

Human excrement, condoms, sanitary towels and toilet paper are released untreated into rivers through combined sewer overflow pipes – just as it was in 19th-century London.These pipes are supposed to be a safety valve to release pressure in the system and used only when an exceptionally large amount of water enters the system.The data emerges as increasing numbers of people are using England’s rivers to swim, kayak and paddleboard.Countries are legally obliged to treat sewage before it is released into waterways. Discharges of untreated human waste are permitted only in “exceptional circumstances” for example after extreme rainfall, the European court of justice has ruled.But the scale of the sewage releases in 2019 reveals what one industry insider said was the frequent and routine nature of discharging untreated effluent from storm overflows.The source, who has worked in the industry for many years, said the discharges released “a horrible septic mix of nasties into the rivers”.He said the industry had for years ignored warnings about the growing scale of spills from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) – storm pipes that allow rainwater, untreated sewage and runoff to discharge into waterways.Recent scientific research has also raised concerns that Covid-19 can be carried into rivers via sewage discharges. data reveals 6,508 inland CSOs released untreated sewage into rivers 204,134 times in 2019. The spills discharged for 1.53m hours across the nine English water companies.Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary, said: “Sewage discharges should take place only in the most extreme of circumstances. Regulation needs to be tightened to stop water companies using discharges as a day-to-day measure.“Customers will rightly be shocked at the frequency of sewage discharges and the damage it does to some of our country’s most precious and valuable river habitats.”The Environment Agency issues permits to allow water companies to release untreated human waste, which includes excrement, condoms and toilet paper, from CSOs after extreme weather events, such as torrential rain, to stop water backing up and flooding homes.More than 60 discharges a year from a storm overflow should trigger an investigation by the agency but the data reveals some storm overflows have released discharges hundreds of times. The Environment Agency relies on water companies to self-monitor their CSOs.Ashley Smith of the campaign group Windrush against Sewage Pollution said the system was little more than a “licence to pollute”. Smith, who monitors sewage spills on the River Windrush in Oxfordshire, said discharges happened after just a rain shower.He said: “The industry has been given a way to prop up failed infrastructure and it has exploited this enthusiastically. The inability of the Environment Agency to prosecute or even drive improvement has led us to where we are today – in a complete shambles with pollution rife and unchecked.”Michelle Walker of the Rivers Trust described the data as “very alarming”. The environmental charity worked with the ’s data to create an interactive map where you can search for river discharges by area.She said: “When you look at the detail, you see that some of these locations are releasing untreated sewage hundreds of times a year, so they are not just operating during extreme rainstorms.”A recent study revealed the quantity of E coli coming out of CSOs was between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than that coming from treated sewage from wastewater treatment plants.Walker said: “People think our rivers should be fit to swim in but they don’t realise it is legal to discharge untreated raw sewage into our rivers.”Water companies say the spills are so diluted by rainwater and wastewater that they do not affect the quality of the water.Wessex Water said: “As CSOs should only operate during periods of intense rainfall, any foul water released from them will be very dilute … Rarely is a pollution incident attributed to a CSO operating correctly.”Water companies were told by the government to install monitoring on the majority of their combined sewer overflows by March 2020. But by June, the  data reveals 3,400 out of about 10,000 inland outflows owned by the nine water companies still had no monitoring installed.Wessex Water has fitted monitoring devices to 495 of its 1,018 CSOs that can discharge into rivers and inland waters. Last year untreated sewage was released 13,876 times – more than twice as often as in 2018 – with a total duration over the year of 107,404 hours.South West Water has monitors on 410 of its 548 inland CSOs. In 2019, sewage was discharged from them 7,850 times over 36,149 hours.Yorkshire Water discharged untreated sewage from the 730 inland CSOs, which are monitored 22,906 times over 616,643 hours. Most of its 2,240 outflows into rivers are not fitted with monitors. data shows Southern Water released raw sewage into rivers last year 19,977 hours in 3,219 incidents.In March, the company separately pleaded guilty to 51 pollution charges over five years involving breaches of Environment Agency permits at treatment plants, which included 8,400 incidents of sewage escaping.Severn Trent has fitted monitoring devices to 1,239 of its 2,897 inland CSOs. The monitored storm overflows discharged untreated sewage for 272,518 hours in 2019.Dr Andrew Singer, a senior scientist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said the pollution impact of CSO discharge was a risk to ecological and human health.“English rivers, even the Thames and the Severn, are relatively small, so the contribution of CSOs to many of our rivers can be extremely significant,” he said. “Rivers are much more likely to be impacted now by CSOs because of the increase in population density and the fact that the sewage system has not expanded to meet it.”Singer called for more transparency from water companies.A spokesperson for Wessex Water said: “In an ideal world there would not be a combined sewerage system, but many sewers were laid at a time when only one drain served a property – carrying both rainwater and sewage … Since 2000 we have invested £181m to upgrade more than 582 CSOs, and there are plans to improve more over the next five years.”The Environment Agency could not say whether any of the 1.5m hours of spills had led to an investigation.A spokesperson said: “The sewage system is designed to overflow to relieve pressure on the system – discharges from CSOs are not a sign the system is faulty or being misused.“However, when companies do damage the environment, whether it is through polluting our waters or breaching permit conditions, we will take enforcement action against them including civil sanctions.”The spokesperson said there was more to do to improve water quality, despite substantial improvements over the past two decades. “We have already secured a more robust and consistent approach for water and sewerage companies to monitor CSO spills.”A spokesperson for the industry body Water UK, said: “The water industry is committed to the very highest environmental standards … Although there is currently no simple and effective alternative to overflows, there are some innovative solutions being used, such as sustainable drainage systems, which are natural features that help keep rainwater out of the sewer. In new housing developments, these can help to take some of the pressure off the sewer network.”• Visit an interactive map, created by the Rivers Trust with the ’s data, where you can search discharges in your area.• Statements from the water companies can be read in full here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e3883cf516ce4c3bce365e02e8886107c1a30c2/0_388_4090_2455/master/4090.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b85b09b7628382d4d41a48c159bf376","title":"revealed development banks funding industrial livestock farms around the world","story":"Investigation uncovers finance worth $2.6bn pumped into meat and dairy industries, despite warnings of links to climate catastrophe Two of the world’s leading development banks have pumped billions of dollars into the global livestock sector, despite warnings that reducing meat and dairy consumption is essential for tackling the climate crisis.The International Finance Corporation (IFC) – the commercial lending arm of the World Bank – and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have provided $2.6bn (£2.1bn) for pig, poultry and beef farming, as well as dairy and meat processing, in the past 10 years.The UK government is a major funder of both banks and its own development bank, CDC, has also invested tens of millions of pounds in the global livestock sector over the past decade, including finance for an industrial-scale beef feedlot in Ethiopia and poultry companies in Niger and Uganda.Development banks provide medium and long-term capital for the purpose of economic growth in poorer countries. The IFC and EBRD have both publicly committed to tackling man-made climate change and making investment decisions with the climate in mind.But an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the  has revealed that IFC and EBRD finance – which involved direct investments, loans and other financial support – was used for industrial-scale mega-farms, abattoirs and the expansion of multinational meat and dairy corporations.In one recent case, a beef cattle feedlot in Madagascar, owned by a conglomerate of more than 20 companies, was granted funding worth $3.5m to produce beef for export to the Middle East and the domestic market. In another, Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork company, received a substantial cash injection from the IFC for its activities in Romania.“Expanding production and consumption of meat and dairy is incompatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement,” said Prof Pete Smith, chair in plant and soil science at the University of Aberdeen and a lead author of a landmark UN report about the impact of land use and agriculture on climate change. He cited research showing that a shift to vegetarian or vegan diets, among other food sector and land-use changes, by half of the global population by 2050 is required to meet the Paris goals.“While some investments by development agencies and banks in animal agriculture to improve food security in the world’s poorest nations may be justifiable, massive investments in livestock production systems in countries that already have high levels of consumption, and in multinational meat and dairy companies, clearly is not,” he added.Last week in a landmark climate report the World Bank committed to working with clients to incentivise sustainable diets and “address drivers of increased meat consumption”, and said it was considering advocating for a carbon tax on the livestock sector. The report extolled the climate benefits of plant-based meat substitutes.Jeremy Coller, head of investment firm Coller Capital and founder of responsible finance network Fairr, said that while the financial world was beginning to play its role in lowering greenhouse gases, it was “crazily disjointed and inconsistent for the IFC and EBRD to invest public funds in intensive animal agriculture, one of the world’s highest-emitting industries”.Our analysis of public records and industry data highlights how the banks have financed companies operating across eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Some investments were in countries where meat supply is currently low, such as Ethiopia, but others were made in places where meat consumption per capita is already high or average, such as Ukraine, China and Romania.The dairy sector was the biggest recipient of IFC and EBRD funding, with processing companies and farms receiving more than $1bn. The pig and poultry sectors each received about $500m.The IFC told the Bureau that it is intentionally catering for growing global demand for meat and dairy and that the livestock sector is a key pillar of food security and poverty reduction in many countries. It acknowledged, however, that the sector had a “large environmental and climate footprint”.The impact of each project should be considered against global and national emission budgets, according to Prof Tim Benton, director of the Energy, Environment and Resources programme at Chatham House.But he warned that trying to reduce the carbon footprint of a pint of milk or a single chicken is pointless when demand for those products keeps increasing. “Just because the greenhouse gas efficiency of a unit of meat or dairy has improved, if everybody’s eating more of it, the total emissions that come from meat or dairy might increase.”Both development banks told the Bureau that they assess inidual projects for their carbon emissions. The EBRD added that it had introduced practices to assess climate risks across its entire portfolio.Some of the companies funded by the development banks are multinational agribusinesses or their subsidiaries or affiliates. In 2010, the EBRD took a stake in the eastern European and central Asian subsidiaries of the French group Danone, one of the world’s biggest dairy companies, which generated sales of €25.3bn (£22.5bn) in 2019. The EBRD said that its investment – now ended – had been intended to expand the dairy markets and Danone’s operations in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.Among projects recently approved by the IFC is a loan of $54m to the India-based poultry giant Suguna, the country’s leading chicken supplier and one of the world’s top 10 biggest poultry producers. The company serves export markets as well as Indian consumers.The IFC loan is partly designed to aid the company’s expansion into Kenya and Bangladesh, with finance earmarked for construction of feed mills and hatcheries.The fully integrated agribusiness, which claims to work with 39,000 farms across 18 Indian states, was previously caught up in controversy, after it was alleged that an antibiotic, whose use the WHO had said should be curtailed, was found being used on one of its contract farms. The company denied this.Suguna is not the only India-based poultry company to have been supported by the IFC, with rival Srinivasa receiving an injection of more than $20m in 2018.Smithfield Foods – now part of the Chinese conglomerate WH Group – also benefited from IFC finance, with loans of $60m for its operations in Romania.Smithfield is the world’s largest pig producer and pork processor, and it recently hit global headlines after the Covid-19 pandemic forced it to close its flagship meatpacking plant in South Dakota, which reportedly supplies 18 million meals a day to US consumers.The UK government has pledged to use its presidency of COP26, the annual UN climate talks, to “green local and international supply chains for foodstuffs and key commodities” and “increase the alignment of financial flows with net-zero”.The CDC told the Bureau it was about to publish a new climate change strategy to make sure agricultural companies it invested in implement “climate smart agricultural practices in order to decrease emissions and increase resilience to a warming climate... It is also important to remember that one in five people living in Africa experience hunger. Alleviating levels of chronic malnourishment and improving food security remain vital development goals.”The IFC accepted that animal protein has “a large environmental and climate footprint, yet it is important to note that its growth is demand driven and linked to people’s dairy and meat consumption preferences”.It justified the investments in the livestock industry by saying that “in most developing countries there is a significant portion of the population that struggles to meet their daily minimum requirements for nutrition, including protein”.An EBRD spokesperson said the bank is “primarily investing in increased efficiency, improvements in energy use along supply chains, improved animal welfare, waste management and utilisation (including manure management), and production of green energy”.The bank also said it actively pursued the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, “including by improving resource efficiency along the meat supply chains from farming to distribution”.Note: Figures are quoted based on money earmarked for specific projects.

There are puns, pratfalls, provocations, foregroundbackground dynamics, double entendres, references to film and TV and popular commercials, random acts of silliness and absurdity, and every possible strain of what would later be categorized as a “dad joke”. Even at 40, when a handful of the references and bits have grown whiskers, Airplane! still absolutely kills. Rarely has a film so eager to please been so successful in doing so.And yet, as easy as it might be to tally up 87 minutes of laughs or marvel at the high batting average of its creative team – David and Jerry Zucker, and Jim Abrahams, better known as Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker (ZAZ) – the non-jokes are a key part of what makes it work. That may sound like asking jazz aficionados to listen between the notes, but the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team understood (at the time, anyway) that a good comedy needs a straight man, and they found one in Zero Hour!, a largely forgotten 1957 drama that served as a primary source of inspiration. And not a source like Top Gun would be to the Abrahams solo projects Hot Shots! and Hot Shots! Part Deux, but the entire foundation on which the comedy would rest.Though Airplane! riffs on the Airport series (particularly Airport 1975) and Irwin Allen disaster movies like The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno, it’s a straight-up remake of Zero Hour!, with just a little spin on the ball. Key elements are exactly the same: a hero named Ted Stryker, a former second world war fighter pilot still haunted by the six comrades killed because of a decision he made in combat. A flight he catches at the last minute to win back a woman who’s left him a “Dear John” note. An illness that sweeps through the airplane cabin, debilitating all the passengers who ordered fish instead of meat, including the pilot and the co-pilot. Stryker getting called up to steer the plane to safety, guided on the ground by the no-nonsense captain who was his superior during the war.Not only are some of lines repeated verbatim, but tiny details survive, too, like Stryker’s refusal to stay in the air another two hours until the stormy weather clears, or the ridiculous geysers of sweat that pour down his face as he approaches the landing. Much of the fun of Airplane! comes from Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker’s instinct that just the tone of an average 1957 melodrama would sound funny in 1980, when a more naturalistic style of acting and screenwriting had fully taken over the industry. When the Stryker in Airplane!, stewing bitterly about the pilots who died under his command, says a line like, “A lot of people had plans before the war. Like George Zipp,” it’s hilarious in 1980 (and 2020) in a way it might not have been in 1957. The film goes off on crazier tangents, but often it doesn’t need to depart from Zero Hour! much at all.There’s no better example of the ZAZ approach to the spoof than the casting of Leslie Nielsen as Dr Rumack, the onboard physician who tends to the sick passengers while giving Stryker the occasional pep talk. Though Nielsen had appeared briefly in Kentucky Fried Movie, the anthology comedy ZAZ wrote before Airplane!, he spent the first 25 years of his career as a character actor for film and television, with appearances in Forbidden Planet and the Poseidon Adventure, but nothing that made him a name. His gravitas is all that Airplane! needs in that role, as if he were a time traveler ported in from another cinematic era and not told he was in a comedy. As Nielsen became more self-aware in future ZAZ productions and other spoofs, the effect was diminished.Robert Hays and the wonderful Julie Hagerty play it straight, too, as Stryker and his stewardess girlfriend Elaine, whose love story is dreamily recalled in flashbacks that nod to Saturday Night Fever and From Here to Eternity. Watching Airplane! multiple times, the jokes that stand out tend to be the ones where ZAZ have an idea that’s so outrageously labored, it’s funny just to think about how much they were straining for a laugh. There’s the names, for one, like the “Who’s On First?” confusion of populating the cockpit with men named Oveur, Roger, and Victor (“Over, Oveur. Roger, Roger. What’s your vector, Victor?”), or having Oveur carry on separate phone conversations with someone from the Mayo Clinic and another gentlemen with the surname Ham (“Give me Ham on five, hold the Mayo”). But there’s effort beyond all sorts of other bits, too: the escalation of the fight between parking zone announcers (“You want me to have an abortion!”), the stunt-casting of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ethyl Merman, the willfully idiotic wordplay (“Surely you can’t be serious?” “I am serious, and don’t call me ‘Shirley’”).Not all of Airplane! is timeless, but the “dated” aspects of the film can cut both ways. From the vantage of 2020, we might cringe at the racial comedy of two black men speaking in subtitled “jive”, or Stryker teaching “the Malombo tribe” to play basketball, but it doesn’t matter that Airplane! parodies airplane disaster movies that few have ever seen or references a coffee commercial from the early 70s or Elaine throwing an era-specific Tupperware party for the Malombo women (“This two-quart Seals-M-Rite container keeps hot dog buns fresh for days”). The same goes for future ZAZ classics like Top Secret! and The Naked Gun: rooting a spoof in genre obscurities from Hollywood past turns the absence of timeliness into a secret virtue.That’s the lesson that later spoof series like Scary Movie or other execrable Jason FriedbergAaron Seltzer team-ups like Date Movie or Meet the Spartans never learned. Airplane! does have a few riffs on hits like Jaws and Saturday Night Fever, but it doesn’t give itself over to lazy business of re-staging scenes from the latest blockbusters with the slightest (and often grossest) of twists.It’s weird. It’s unexpected. It’s absurd. And it never pauses for a laugh, because there’s always another one coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c8254cc51be58bc0749aba8741dc4e63e40ec09/752_1513_6136_3680/master/6136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4be97cecaf4a169679865e5347e4798","title":"how to cook crab linguine recipe felicity cloake","story":"Revive memories of Italian seaside cafes with this step-by-step guide to making classic crab linguineFew things scream summer holiday to me more than a big bowl of briny, seafood-studded pasta, even if it’s going to be eaten in front of the TV rather than some pretty Italian harbour. Happily, seafood is one of the things we do rather well in this country, and this dish is the perfect end for a fat, brown, British crab.

You may have bought it ready picked, but if not, you’ll need to get at the meat first. There are many online videos and tutorials showing this process in detail, but start by snapping off the claws close to the body, then remove the bottom of the shell by inserting the tip of a knife into the mouth (just below the eyes) and twisting gently.Prise off the back of the shell and locate and remove the hard spiny bits around the eyes and mouth, and the yellowish stomach sac attached to them, plus any bits of papery membrane and the dead man’s fingers, the greyish fronds around the edge of the shell. (Despite the name, they’re not poisonous, but they’re not very tasty, either.)Scoop the brown meat into one bowl and the white into another – a\u0026nbspsharp tap with a hammer, rolling pin or even a wooden spoon will help you to get into the stuff in the claws. Don’t miss the white meat in the leg sockets, either the handle of a teaspoon is a useful tool here. Keep any large pieces of claw meat separate.\u0026nbspBring a large pan of generously salted water to a boil and cook the pasta to your taste – this should take around eight to 10 minutes, unless you like it very al dente or very soft. Linguine is my preference here, but spaghetti, or any other long pasta, would also be fine (in fact, let’s be honest, almost any shape would be delicious).\u0026nbspWhile the pasta is cooking, peel and finely chop the garlic, and deseed and finely chop the chilli. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat, then fry the garlic, chilli and fennel seeds for a couple of minutes until soft, but not coloured remember that garlic, in particular, burns easily.Take the frying pan off the heat, grate in the zest of half the lemon, then squeeze in the juice of the whole thing (do this through your other hand, to catch any errant pips alternatively, squeeze it into a cup and pour it into the pan through a sieve). Now stir in all the brown crab meat until well combined.\u0026nbspScoop a few tablespoons of the pasta cooking water out of the pan and set aside, then drain the pasta. Add the drained pasta to the frying pan, season and toss it around to coat the strands with the sauce add a little of the reserved cooking water, if you think it needs loosening.\u0026nbspRoughly chop the parsley, set a little aside to garnish and add the rest to the pan along with the 200g white crab meat (if you don’t have any large claw pieces, keep a little bit back, to finish). Toss again, ide between bowls and drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil. Finish with the remaining parsley and the claw (or reserved white) meat, and serve at once.If you’d like to add vegetables, the River Cafe puts shaved fresh fennel into its crab pasta, while River Cottage goes for fresh tomatoes (I reckon a handful of the cherry variety, added to the pan with the garlic and chilli, so they just burst in the heat, would be best). Tinned crab doesn’t seem to work well here, sadly – or at least not the brands I’ve tried.⁃  aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

You can pick one up for as little as three quid, and it does olives as well.If you haven’t got one of these and you’re faced with a recipe asking you to stone 500g of cherries, the most sensible course is to sit down, eat all the cherries and spit the stones out the window.

You can also manage the operation – messily – with a paperclip, should you find yourself cooking in an office setting.Nigel Slater’s recipes for cherry pie and cherry polenta cake are both good places to start – they’re straightforward and don’t ask too much of you. One of the difficulties of cherry season is that it arrives just at the point when the weather makes baking seem like a terrible idea. Chill your pastry dough that little bit longer, and find some shade to sit in while you wait.Cherry sorbet sounds an altogether cooler dessert, and Tamal Ray’s recipe requires only about 20 minutes over a hot stove. Better still, it has just three ingredients: cherries, sugar and white wine. Incidentally, if you’re going to end up with a puree, you don’t need to make a fuss about stoning the cherries. Just whack each one with the flat of a knife like you would a clove of garlic the stone will come away easily. Or, as Ray points out, you can cook the cherries whole and remove the stones once they’re soft.Clafoutis is a French dessert – whole cherries (stones left in, traditionally) baked in a batter until just set. Felicity Cloake’s perfect version contains almond essence and kirsch – a morello cherry liqueur which she describes as “ridiculously expensive”. Feel free to leave it out, along with the stones.Alternatively, you could invest in some kirsch for the season, since it is also called for in Liam Charles’s wholly nontraditional cherry bakewell custard tart. There is a lot going on in the name of this dish, but it is not unrelated to the clafoutis: cherries, almond essence and kirsch, baked in custard.This cherry galette also marries cherries and almonds – in this case via frangipane, the almond, flour, butter, sugar and egg paste that occupies a mysterious border realm somewhere between crust and filling. “Galette”, roughly translated, means “don’t worry – it’s supposed to look like that.” White spelt flour is recommended for the pastry, but it’s not a dealbreaker.Rachel Roddy’s cherry and ricotta tart has a latticed crust top with ricotta puffing out from underneath and a cherry filling below that. In Italy the cherries would be sour, but you can make this work with whatever sort you’ve got. The trick is to avoid overcooking the cherries – remove them with a slotted spoon before they turn mushy, reduce the remaining liquid to a syrup, and then put the cherries back in.Cherries and chocolate are another classic combination, most notably in black forest gateau, which is normally made with tinned black cherries, sometimes with the perverse addition of fresh cherries – stalks on – as a decoration. Dan Lepard uses fresh cherries to make the filling first. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall preserves the basic pairing in his cherry chocolate tart, which calls for yet more kirsch. It also requires you to be forward thinking enough to leave the cherries to infuse overnight.For sheer laid-back ease, I love the idea of a “broken cake”: basically any stale cake ripped up and tossed with cherry syrup, fresh fruit, cream or ricotta and other things. It’s hardly even a recipe, and it makes Eton mess look positively ordered.Fresh cherries may just be for summer, but they’re not just for pudding. They can make an appearance in salads, alongside rocket or goat’s cheese or both, with cucumber, basil and quinoa, or roasted, with buttermilk dressing and lettuce.This pickled-cherries recipe (Nigel Slater again – going through his back catalogue, you get the impression he really likes cherries) can be served over mackerel or gammon. And duck with cherry sauce is most definitely a thing. A seasonal glut and a greedy nature will invariably leave you with some less than perfect, slightly post-ripe fruit and the distinct feeling that you never want to look at another cherry again. This will not last, but in the meantime you can make enough jam to see you through the dark, cheerless, cherryless months. This is an easy method, but the jam sugar is not optional: cherries are low in pectin, so they won’t set by themselves. In contrast, this cherry and chia seed jam, from reader Rheanna Lucy Akua Griffin, has no sugar in it: just a little agave nectar or honey.Finally, when you have exhausted all other avenues, make this cherry vodka – absolutely no stoning required. Slit 400g of cherries, heat them with water and sugar until dissolved, cool, add a bottle of vodka, seal the mixture up and leave it for at least four weeks. It’s the poor man’s kirsch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/498f5d30b84dc70a98653c7801fb383c4f56b2b2/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2791e0b95afa27be60320c592be63d20","title":"premier leagues promoted clubs debts","story":"The Premier League will charge newly promoted clubs £8m each next season and in 2021-22 to help soften the blow of broadcast revenues lost because of the Covid-19 crisis.The development has caused bewilderment among Championship clubs with hopes of going up. They question why they must pay a penalty that relates to a Premier League season in which they have played no part and some are viewing it as akin to paying an entrance fee for an exclusive members’ club.In their opinion, the top ision ought to be spreading its largesse down the leagues – as the government has demanded – and not, in effect, make a raid on upwardly mobile Football League clubs.The Premier League has been forced to agree to rebates of £330m to broadcasters because of the failure, through no fault of its own, to deliver its product as advertised. It will not pay the money now but in instalments over next season and the one after – years two and three of a three-year broadcast deal.Under the plan, which Championship clubs learned of last week, the three teams promoted would each pay £8m, with the three coming up in 2020-21 doing the same – adding up to £48m.Promotion is estimated to be worth £180m to a club and the likelihood would be that the £8m would be deducted from money paid out by the league. Clubs relegated can expect parachute payments of between £75m-90m over two or three years and they too would be expected to contribute towards the broadcasting rebate. It will most likely be taken from their parachute payments.The argument in favour of charging the promoted clubs, of making them bear a portion of the responsibility, relates to the knock-on effects of coronavirus how it will affect not only this season but the next one and even the one after.The next Premier League season will kick off later than planned and the league, in negotiations with broadcasters over the rebate, has essentially paid a price to control the flexibility of the start date. Therefore the promoted clubs are being told to contribute to that premium.A further counterpoint is that promoted clubs are entering a changed landscape, a competition operating with altered costs over the next two seasons. It is a reality and, as they will belong to that competition, it is felt that they should pay."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1010815f78683761d54a4bca3bd25abedf201b/0_325_2212_1326/master/2212.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c149749db03c60b120b2456aa19b2c28","title":"liverpool manchester city premier league","story":"Five years ago, a rampant win at Manchester City contained all the clues for what was to come from the new championsAs Liverpool enter the Etihad Stadium on Thursday they will be greeted by the echoey weirdness that is part of playing football right now. But they will hear the birds sing as the champions baton is passed to them by Manchester City, and for Jürgen Klopp there will also be whispers from a game that took place there five years ago and which can be looked upon as the start of the glory he has brought to the club.Saturday 21 November 2015 – Manchester City 1 Liverpool 4. It was a blitz as emphatic as it was unexpected. A rampant display by those in red and what was up to that point the undoubted high point of Klopp’s reign as Liverpool manager – perhaps not saying much given there had only been seven previous games and three of those had been draws while another was a home defeat to Crystal Palace. Nevertheless, it was the high point, partly because of the result but mainly because of the performance. The first, full-on display of Klopp-ball: Merseyside edition.The visitors were aggressive and explosive, destabilising City with a concerted counterpress and moving the ball not only quickly and sharply but across various angles. Their play was bewitching, summed up by the opening goal, which arrived after only seven minutes and saw Eliaquim Mangala put the ball into his own net after making a mess (typically, some may say) of trying to keep out Roberto Firmino’s cross.“Liverpool have been knocking the ball around with some confidence,” said Martin Tyler on commentary and that was especially evident in their next two goals as Firmino put another cross into the area, this time for Philippe Coutinho to finish, and then, on 32 minutes, the Brazilians switched roles to put Liverpool 3-0 up via the move of the game – patient, confident and studded with a gorgeous backheel by Emre Can. “That is absolutely brilliant,” said Gary Neville, also commentating. The praise was justified. Liverpool had a big lead in the blink of an eye, and while City responded via Sergio Agüero’s strike a minute before half-time they never did enough to reverse the tide that was overwhelming them. Indeed it was Liverpool who scored again via Martin Skrtel’s rasping shot on 81 minutes. Game well and truly over.It was a stunning win. Sure, City were not the side they had been or would become, stuttering as they were through Manuel Pellegrini’s final season in charge, but they were still formidable opposition, especially at home. On this occasion however, in front of their own fans, they had been torn to shreds. “It was a complete disaster,” said Pellegrini after the final whistle, his expression more haunted and haggard than usual.The hard running had been there in previous matches, most strikingly in Klopp’s first in charge – the goalless draw at Tottenham on 17 October. But what elevated this performance above the rest, including the 3-1 victory away to champions Chelsea on Halloween, was its quality and cohesion, and central to this, literally as well as figuratively, was Firmino.The Brazilian went into the City game with his value to Liverpool clouded in uncertainty. Things had not been going well for the 24-year-old since his £29m arrival from Hoffenheim in June, mainly under Brendan Rodgers but also under Klopp. The German had twice started Firmino as a No 10 and once, in the win at Stamford Bridge, as a lone forward, and while he did OK his contributions were neither sparkling or potent. There had been no goals and little to write home about.But that all changed at the Etihad. Firmino was again deployed centrally but this time as a false nine in a three-man frontline, given the licence to move into dangerous positions inside the area and also drift across the attacking line, all the while supported by, and supporting, the forwards either side of him. Sound familiar?It was the start of the Bobbylution, and while Firmino wasn’t the best player on the pitch – that was Coutinho, who started on the left of the front three with Adam Lallana on the right – he was formidable, scoring the first goal of his Liverpool career, providing the assists for two others and generally tormenting City with his guile and swagger. His talents shone (as did those teeth), the first notable contribution from a fundamental figure in the team that has gone on to conquer Europe, the world and actually what mattered most: England.Like the bulletin board in Kujan’s office at the end of The Usual Suspects, it turns out the clues were there all along on that cold Manchester evening. The intent, effort, tactical and technical expertise, and what Klopp has done since is build on those foundations, overhauling his squad to ensure it is capable of achieving the required levels of quality and consistency (Firmino aside, only three players from that matchday squad remain at the club), and fostering a sense of unity on and off the pitch that means Liverpool are not just a hugely successful club but also a happy one.And it is fitting their first game after ending that three-decade yearning for the league title should be against City. The team that has pushed them the hardest and become their most intense rival during the Klopp era – and at whose home the manager’s brilliant fire well and truly burst into life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b961345381287d726c93f08c413fa194a4ebb9a/0_274_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a42ed3c398489aa6d645f8d42a51a6be","title":"uk treasury faces backlash after hailing pubs reopening on saturday","story":"Critics says tweet encouraging patrons to ‘grab a drink’ is in poor taste given UK’s Covid-19 death tollThe Treasury has been accused of taking an irresponsible approach to the coronavirus epidemic after a backlash to a post on its official Twitter account that hailed Saturday’s scheduled reopening of England’s pubs.“Grab a drink and raise a glass, pubs are reopening their doors from 4 July,” the tweet read, while a graphic carried the message: “Pubs are back”.Many of those condemning the post, which was soon deleted, accused its celebratory tone of being in poor taste given that the virus has killed at least 43,000 people in the UK.The tweet came as Leicester was put back under lockdown conditions amid a localised outbreak and fears were expressed about numbers of cases being seen in Greater Manchester.The Labour MP Geraint Davies said: “This is wholly irresponsible publicity by the Conservative government, which will fuel a resurgence of coronavirus infection and death in England.”Boris Johnson has been criticised over his confused messaging at a time of national crisis. While he warned people not to “overdo it” as he announced the lifting of some lockdown measures on 23 June, he also said: “Frankly, I can’t wait to go to a pub or a restaurant even if it’s not compatible with the diet that I’m on.“I think people need to go out, I think people need to enjoy themselves and rediscover things that they have been able to do for a long time. I want to see bustle. I want to see activity.”He told seaside towns to “show some guts” when asked how they might be expected to deal with the possibility of crowds flocking to take advantage of the hot weather and loosening rules. And he added: “It is very, very important that people who do represent seaside communities, places where UK tourists will want to go, should be as welcoming as they can possibly be.”Shortly afterwards, he condemned people “taking too many liberties” as a major incident was declared on the south coast due to large crowds on the beaches.The Treasury has not responded to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6743d105f5fcac5c7af7c8a3bd517dd32fa4752/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4811ea062334054c76547678da45eb","title":"i found myself in charge of the kids did lockdown make me a better dad","story":"Spoiler alert: the answer is yes. But home schooling a five-year-old was a steep learning curveI don’t exactly remember the first time that I saw the words “home schooling” in the context of a thing society might actually expect me to do. But I have a feeling it was a mention from someone on Twitter, and that I smiled fondly at how earnestly they were taking the rapidly deteriorating “situation”, as the coronavirus pandemic shut Britain down for more than three months.This is not to say that I’m a lazy parent. I love spending time with my two-year-old and my five-year-old. But it’s probably true to say that my main role was to drive them to stuff and go with them to the park. I took a very dim idea of such newfangled ideas as “screens”. So the thought of being left solely in charge for an extended spell was nerve-wracking, but fanciful. Honestly, the five-year-old’s imminent first six-week school holiday was a worry. But it’s not like anybody would expect me to be solely in charge of him for all that time (or more).As it turns out, for much of the past few months, trying to relate to those worries felt akin to connecting to the worldview of early Neolithic civilisations. A lot happened. First I had to work from home with my wife. Then the schools and nurseries shut. Then everything else shut. Then I got furloughed, while my wife didn’t. It rapidly became apparent that our briefly untenable domestic arrangement had suddenly become very tenable: I would be in charge of the kids, all the time.Parenting felt both overwhelming and simple. On one level it was obvious what I would have to do. I would take them to the park as much as possible, while trying to educate the older one and stop the younger one from destroying stuff. And I would absolutely get over my fear of screens – data would be my friend.Fortunately, I had three major early breakthroughs. One, my wife pointed out that every week the school bunged a load of classwork on its website that I could print out to form a rudimentary “lesson plan”. Two, I successfully unearthed, recharged and remembered the password for the iPad we bought aeons ago and immediately ignored entirely. And three, I made the discovery that our TV – which we’ve owned for three years – has a YouTube Kids app installed.Things started to fall into place. A loose but functional day of teaching was cobbled together from the plans provided by the school, interspersed with a selection of webcasts (Joe Wicks, Maddie and Greg’s Let’s Go Live) and some learning sites disguised as fun games (Teach Your Monster to Read, Carol Vorderman’s The Maths Factor). There was also the heavily rationed daily bribe of a Jurassic World game downloaded to the iPad, which the five-year-old was nuts for and the two-year-old was hypnotised by. It was definitely a tiny bit ramshackle, not least because the five-year-old is a small boy and the two-year-old is a shambling monster of pure id, and their priorities don’t always overlap.More importantly, it was actually fun. Although I covered all the bases, I tried to make the learning lean on what the eldest enjoyed more, ie maths – thanks to the Vorderman website, his powers of adding and subtracting have come on way beyond what’s expected of a child in reception. If his attention was waning on phonics or handwriting, I could always look up some sort of dinosaur-themed variant on my phone.Above all, as we emerge from lockdown (fingers crossed) I feel like a much better parenttutor than I thought I was. I don’t think for a second I’m in the same league as the teachers at the eldest’s school, blessedly now reopened, but the fact is we survived. Some learning happened, and everybody basically had a good time. Lockdown could have been quite traumatic for the kids, but I think they actually had fun, and I suppose I did too.And it’s not like things have simply reverted. When we go out – especially to meet my child-free friends – I’m not worried about breaking out the iPad or passing over my phone to keep the big child happy after a while. Do his maths or watch a video or download a new game on the Playtime Island app? Yes, absolutely, high five to unlimited data.The new normal is still tough for kids, with playgrounds remaining shut in England, and confusing distancing rules to abide by. A quick shot of parentally supervised data can make them feel safe and familiar in still-strange circumstances. And while “How was school?” is a question that continues to get a very abstract response from the five-year-old at 3pm, when we get home we both look forward to playing his Jurassic World game. Sitting side-by-side, united by the screen, the details of his day trickle out. Because school must be a bit strange right now, with all the handwashing and attempts to social-distance small people who frequently forget. While we play his favourite game, we talk about what matters. We’re connected.Looking at child-free friends’ anxiety-laden tweets, I wonder if I really would have had a marvellous time twiddling my thumbs through an unoccupied furlough – perhaps me and the kids actually got each other through it. Would I do it again? Well it looks like I’ll be able to deploy the grandparents come the summer holidays, and that more stuff will be open than closed. But whatever the case: I’ve got it covered. I know I can look after my children, and that knowledge is a wonderful thing.From keeping the kids entertained while you’re out meeting the friends you haven’t seen in months to staying connected to social media on the go, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

Only images taken at one wavelength, 17.1 nanometres, were used in the video, with the extreme ultraviolet wavelength of the images allowing for the sun’s golden yellow, outermost atmospheric layer – the corona – to be visible.Nasa commissioned German musician Lars Leonhard to compose Solar Observe to accompany the video.In a statement released with the video, Nasa explained why there were a few blank frames in the video and the infrequent changes of focus away from the sun.“While SDO has kept an unblinking eye pointed toward the sun, there have been a few moments it missed,” it said. “The dark frames in the video are caused by Earth or the moon eclipsing SDO as they pass between the spacecraft and the sun.”Nasa also explained that a “longer blackout” in the footage in 2016 was caused by a temporary AIA instrument issue that took a week to fix.“The images where the Sun is off-centre were observed when SDO was calibrating its instruments,” Nasa said.The SDO mission is expected to continue observing the sun until 2030."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f7161259a5950eabf076fb4dfba2a127b607b3d/0_334_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34aa470bdd0f24a436efd5b072b34484","title":"we never ran out of toilet roll the edinburgh eco store thats thriving in lockdown","story":"The husband and wife team running The Eco Larder have been stranded in different parts of Scotland in lockdown, but that’s not stopping them from keeping their zero-waste store openOn 5 June, The Eco Larder co-owner Matthew Foulds had his first day off work for 90 days. Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

But anyone hoping to pop in and browse the bookshelves, take their child to rhymetime or spend a couple of hours using the computers is going to be disappointed.“We have the capacity for 20 people at a time,” says Rachel Braithwaite, project development manager at the Archibald Corbett Library in south London, which will, unlike many other libraries, be opening its doors from 4 July and restarting at least some former activities. “There will be a space marshall and hand sanitiser at the door. Everyone feels differently. People who would be worried won’t come. But personally I’m looking forward to it.”Returned books will be put into crates and quarantined for 72 hours. As for browsing, there may be a system whereby any books that have been touched and not borrowed have to go into quarantine it’s still to be decided. But the system to check books out is in place: librarians will be behind perspex screens, through which library cards can be scanned.During lockdown online library services have been booming, but it’s also important, says Braithwaite, to offer more than online services. For the past three weeks, the library has provided a click and collect service – and only one book order has so far been put in. “A lot of our customers are people without access to computers. If we do things like click and collect, or online activities, that won’t reach them,” she explains. “We want people to come in and get books.”Community services will also be available, including helping people without digital access fill in online forms for benefits such as bus passes or universal credit. “We’ve already started those services, out at the back of the library, on the decking. We now plan to move that into a room, with distancing and personal protective equipment,” says Braithwaite. Classes in English for speakers of other languages will also restart, and there will be access to four of the library’s usual nine PCs.Over the past 10 years of austerity, libraries have become vital community hubs, agrees councillor James Lewis, deputy leader of Leeds city council. “We have put a lot more services into libraries – credit unions, job shops, even post offices,” he says. Of the 34 libraries in and around Leeds, six will initially reopen, but there will be no book browsing. Computers will be available, but will have to be booked for 45-minute sessions. Even this limited amount of reopening has taken “painstaking” work, he says.As they gradually reopen, all UK libraries will have to put strict measures in place to ensure the safety of staff and users, including physical distancing and measures such as booking computers in advance. Dates vary around the UK. Libraries in England are able to reopen from 4 July libraries in Scotland from 15 July and in Northern Ireland from 20 July. In Wales, the next review of lockdown measures will be on 13 July until then, some libraries already offer a click and collect service and many are planning how to reopen with limited services.In most areas, it’s the larger libraries, more easily able to provide physical distancing, that are reopening first. In Nottinghamshire, for instance, library spaces have been reorganised with no access to study space, toilets, refreshment areas and no activities.“A lot of us realise that the services we are used to will only come back gradually,” says Portsmouth councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who chairs the culture, tourism and sport committee of the Local Government Association. Many library staff have kept in touch with their users, particularly older and more vulnerable residents, but not everyone will know the new rules. “For some people, that message won’t get to them until they go to the library and talk to staff,” he acknowledges. “There will be teething issues, but I expect people will be OK when things are explained to them.”Lewis agrees. “Trying to get back safely the places where people get together, like libraries, sports centres, museums and galleries, is really frustrating. There’s been nothing like this in anyone’s lifetime, so we didn’t expect government to figure it out to the last penny,” he says. “But we don’t see any extra money. We are already starting the process of service reviews to reduce spending, including potential compulsory redundancies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6a746fe290b01dab8075661b95edb2b8b3b5ae/1_0_2416_1451/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d5b606a13059f2c65b0543fafb74349","title":"life in the amber zone a view of project restart","story":" photographer  Tom Jenkins has documented the Premier League since its restart in June. Here, he looks back on the experience of shooting matches in empty grounds amid strict Covid-19 precautionsClick on each image for more informationThat bloody bird has been putting me off all game. High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football. Welcome to the world of Project Restart, the Covid-19 version of the Premier League.For the last two weeks I have been lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to be let in to see the resumption of top-class football in England. When normally I could be one of between 20 to 50 photographers attending these matches, now it’s just a maximum of 10. Current rules state there must be no more than 300 people inside the ground at any one time.My first game back was the one that launched the resumption, at Aston Villa as they faced Sheffield United. All attendees at matches are required to have a temperature check before accreditation is given. In a building in the main car park I’m stood on a designated spot and look at a screen, like a high-tech speak-your-weight machine. This equipment deems me safe and my pass is handed over. Rumour has it that Manchester City have splashed out on an even flashier thermometerand a scanner operated by a real nurse. At the other grounds I’ve subsequently been to, the temperature check is performed with a little white plastic gun to the forehead. At Spurs, before their game v West Ham, it’s boiling hot. To make matters worse the man with the gun is waiting at the top of a flight of stairs and I’m carrying a ton of gear up there. My fingers are crossed as the gun points at my red, sweaty temple.Every ground is ided into three zones: green, amber and red. Roughly speaking, green is the immediate vicinity outside the stadium, amber inside the ground, red on the pitch and the tunnel area. Only players and club officials, those who are regularly tested, get into the red zone. I am amber. Before every game I’m sent a health declaration form to sign along with safety protocols to read. These vary enormously from club to club but the most substantial and well organised is definitely Liverpool’s, courtesy of their safety officer, Mr Stan Tickle.As I go into the first match at Villa, I look up at a big screen. “Face coverings must be worn at all times” it declares. I’m led to my allotted spot by a couple of kind, middle-aged stewards who are wearing their claret and blue masks as chin warmers. “You can’t move from there” they tell me “and you must wear your mask at all times”. “No problem,” I say as Jamie Redknapp brushes past me looking very dapper in a navy suit but mask-free. A member of ground-staff comes to disinfect the corner flag near me. As I pick up my camera, he is told by a colleague “put your mask on properly, you’re having your picture taken”.The atmosphere inside all the grounds is very strange and eerie. These are stadia I know so well yet it all seems unfamiliar. It’s a real sensory scramble, not only visually but also aurally. I was at Goodison Park for the Everton v Liverpool match, sat in the front row of the Gwladys Street End. Normally a febrile atmosphere emanates from the home fans in that stand, scorn pouring down on anything red. Around me this time are acres of tarpaulin sheets adorned with faces of the Everton faithful. A couple of metres away sits John Powell, Liverpool’s official photographer. “Lovely isn’t it?” he jokes.With 10 minutes left, and the game tied 0-0, Tom Davies hits the inside of the post and Everton are denied a famous winner. It is such a dramatic moment but all I can hear, apart from a couple of expletives from players, are the mellow tunes of a jazz saxophonist playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty from outside the ground. After a few matches I start to get used to the noise of these games. You can hear everything the players, coaches and referees say – it’s quite illuminating. There is so much shouting from the players I begin to wonder how they have the energy to run around. It takes me back to park football, refreshing to hear that multi-millionaires can still say such well-known football phrases as “Man on”, “Push Up”, “Keeper’s ball” or “Pull your finger out” although the last one did include a swear word as well.It’s fascinating to see how clubs have adapted to the rules laid down by the Premier League and government health advisers. Goodison Park’s notoriously tight tunnel means the away team change in a portable building in the car park, while at Tottenham the home team have shifted their changing room to the other side of the ground where the huge, expansive NFL rooms are situated. It’s also meant a lot more work for ground-staff, as they have disinfecting duties with balls, corner flags and goalposts.At Norwich they have an old-fashioned bucket of Dettol to drop balls into, while at Spurs they have armed their staff with Ghostbusters-style backpacks to spray down the posts. Even with all these safety requirements, things can go slightly awry. I was at Watford, positioned near the sideline where the substitutes were warming up. In the stand behind the dugouts the subs had carefully distanced seats to sit in, but as they started to stretch their limbs they gathered in a tight bunch, completely blocking my view of the game. One Watford player put his leg onto the board right by my camera, looked at me in my mask a couple of feet away, realised he was far too close to an amber zone non-tester, and moved away sharpish. After talking to his fellow subs, they all scarpered giving me a lovely clear view again.At Anfield last week, just after Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold arched that beautiful free-kick into the top of the Crystal Palace net, I could clearly hear a commentator eagerly describing the goal, even though he was high up in the Centenary Stand, probably a hundred yards away. It made me think what that stadium would have been like if the crowd had been there and I felt sad for them, deprived of seeing a moment like that in the flesh.I hope that before too long they will back and that the abnormality of behind-closed-doors football will soon be consigned to history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b82993cb5f506d717d1388c21b5bdd33baba0469/0_199_5330_3199/master/5330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba1ff1ada04145e2b1e51d595173a3f5","title":"twickenham tickets for england games could be corporate only this autumn","story":"England supporters hoping to attend this year’s autumn internationals have been dealt a major blow after the Rugby Football Union changed its ticketing policy to reserve the first 28,000 for corporate contracts, the  understands.That means unless the government allows for crowds of nearly 30,000 or more this autumn, the RFU will not be able to sell match tickets to supporters since debenture and box holders, sponsors, as well as the union’s other partners, will be the priority.The RFU has been lobbying the government to permit crowds this autumn amid Covid-19 restrictions, with losses of £100m forecast if England’s matches take place behind closed doors.The union has calculated that if social distancing of two metres is required, around 10,000 fans could be admitted with concerns over transport links a factor. If so, all the tickets would go to contracted groups.The government has announced a reduction to “one metre plus” from Saturday but fans being allowed into any sporting events is still dependent on a relaxation of the current rules, or special dispensation under stage five of the DCMS’s protocols.With social distancing at one metre, crowds of between 35,000-40,000 would be possible, the RFU believes. Given the large number of tickets already contracted, however, the remaining seven- to 12,000 would be prioritised for the RFU’s affiliated clubs and key stakeholders. The RFU estimates that crowds of that size would be worth £3m a match.“Given the unprecedented situation and the extreme financial pressure the RFU is under, the RFU council agreed to temporarily suspend the ticket distribution policy to allow for a focus on fulfilling contracted ticket groups for the 20-21 season,” said an RFU spokesperson.“The decision was taken to preserve rugby revenues, which get invested back in the game. If it is safe for the autumn internationals to go ahead with crowds in attendance, we are hopeful that we will be able to offer tickets to a wide range of stakeholders and fans.”There is a growing expectation that those matches will not take place. Instead a one-off eight-team tournament featuring the Six Nations as well as Japan and Fiji would take place.The RFU’s ticket pricing strategy will not be confirmed until fixtures and permitted capacities have been signed off.The eight-team tournament would mean that England are likely to host three Tests this autumn, and not the four originally scheduled.The home unions have been working on a plan that would see them host three matches and travel for two this autumn. The dates of the autumn window have not yet been finalised. World Rugby was due to vote on the framework earlier this week but that has been delayed with both the RFU and the French federation unable to reach agreements with their respective leagues over player release.The most likely scenario is that England play their postponed Six Nations match against Italy in Rome on 31 October before the eight-team tournament. That would mean three pool matches for Eddie Jones’s side and a final or classification match on 5 December.There will be a mandatory rest week built into the expanded autumn window, while the RFU is also hoping to reschedule its annual fixture between an England XV and the Barbarians, for which some tickets have already been sold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e029471efdd29979782b3b6b38e2004bcca58a11/2_0_3020_1814/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a51d8b6cd8c4f71a0ae05e1300b1878d","title":"f1 2020 team by team guide to the cars and drivers","story":"Lewis Hamilton has repeatedly had an edge over the field with Mercedes and this time he can match Michael Schumacher’s record of seven world titlesAlready six-time consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ champions, achieving the seventh double is entirely feasible. Their car is clearly strong, operationally they are the benchmark and their innovative dual-axis steering system proves they are still relentlessly chasing every edge. In a shortened season, reliability and consistency will be key and Mercedes are pre-eminent in both. Still the team to beat.Focused and driven like never before, Hamilton is at the peak of his powers and if he secures a seventh title would match Michael Schumacher’s record. Has repeatedly proved to have a maturity, skill and the race-craft to return success that is unmatched on the current grid. Strong favourite.Started strongly last season only to be swamped by Hamilton as the world champion found his rhythm. The Finn must be quick out of the blocks again but more than ever needs to sustain his charge if he is to put his teammate under any pressure.Car SF1000 Engine Ferrari Principal Mattia Binotto Debut Monaco 1950 GPs 991 Titles 16 Last season 2ndAppeared down on pace in testing but more is expected in Austria. The Scuderia have focused on improving the car’s downforce to make it more competitive at a greater number of circuits. Aggressive and successful development will be key as might be the potentially difficult task of keeping the peace between their drivers.No 5 Debut USA 2007 Wins 53 Poles 57 Titles 4 Last season 5th Out-raced by his rookie teammate Leclerc last season, Vettel has a point to prove but with Ferrari not renewing his contract and Leclerc in favour his No 1 status is long gone. Still prone to errors under pressure, he needs the serenity of success from the off.Hugely impressive last season, seven poles the best tally of any driver. Will be even more confident and more aggressive this time round. Ferrari have said they will let their drivers race so Leclerc will look to put Vettel under the cosh immediately.In testing, the closest rivals to Mercedes. The RB16 looks strong and Honda’s engine close to parity with Mercedes and Ferrari. Confidence is high that they can really challenge and for the first time in recent years appear to be quick out of the box, the Red Bulls pleasingly resurgent.Showing every indication of now being a more complete driver, Verstappen has all the tools to fight for the title and if he has the car this year, intends to grasp his chance. Never intimidated and with control to match his exuberance, he can take the fight to Mercedes.Parachuted in from Toro Rosso midway through his rookie season, the London-born driver who races under the Thai flag was hugely impressive. Earned his place and can be expected to only improve. Must be in the mix at the front to support Verstappen.Building on their strongest result since 2012, best of the rest remains the target as McLaren reap the rewards of a structural changes. Their car still has room for improvement but showing consistency and focus, McLaren and their two charging drivers will expect to be in the fight for fourth.Last year he delivered on the promise he has always shown, so much so that Ferrari have signed him for 2021. Sainz has touch and intelligence, is comfortable and confident at McLaren and will want to bid farewell with a flourish.An outstanding debut last season that included some remarkable qualifying runs, outshining his more experienced teammate was just the platform Norris needed. Determined to work on his weaknesses and now entirely confident in an F1 car, he will be even stronger second time out.Disappointing last season performing poorly for a works team targeting the title, Renault have to be in the fight for fourth, especially with the company considering its future in F1. The driver pairing is strong, but it is Ocon who may have inherited the No 1 spot after Ricciardo’s decision to jump ship to McLaren for 2021.After a scrappy 2019 Ricciardo wants more. He has the class to deliver but has been frustrated by Renault’s failure to move forward. Still one of the best overtakers, but the Australian may have to take some early licks as the team come up to speed.Back from a year out after two seasons with Force India, Ocon is highly rated and will expect to prove it in a decent car. The Frenchman has speed, consistency and no little bravura in being unafraid to get his elbows out. Potentially a compelling combination.Rebranded and with a fetching new livery, testing was positive enough for Tost to posit fifth place as their target and Sainz picked them out as a threat to McLaren. If Honda’s engine delivers they will likely be in that scrap.No 10 Debut Malaysia 2017 Wins 0 Best finish 2nd Poles 0 Best qualifying 4th Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 7th Demoted mid-season last year from Red Bull, but showed strength in keeping it together to finish well for Toro Rosso, including a second place in Brazil. The car suited him, as it appears to this year, and will be eager to show he has improved.Solid last season for another driver who has been through the Red Bull promotion and demotion mill. Can still impress, as he did with third in Germany last year, but needs to improve his qualifying performances if he is to match his teammate.Car RP20 Engine Mercedes Principal Otmar Szafnauer Debut Belgium 2018 GPs 30 Titles 0 Best finish 7th Last season 7th Took a lot of flak for designing their car around last year’s title-winner, the “Pink Mercedes” is unsurprisingly very quick. Will be in the fight for best of the rest and a bullish team have targeted podium finishes. Sustaining their charge across the season may be more challenging.Having made a long-term commitment to the team he has already served for some time, Pérez is the confident and capable pair of hands they need. A proven points-scorer, this might be his chance to show how good he is in a fight that could feature the big three.Stroll’s chance to make a point, too. With decent machinery he can prove he is not just driving because of his father’s largesse. To do so he must drastically improve the qualifying performances which have left him repeatedly playing catchup.To follow last year’s aggressive design philosophy, Alfa once more have evolved their concept well how far they can take it is the challenge. Expect early gains but without the resources to develop it much beyond those peaks.F1’s grand old man seems to be enjoying his racing out of the spotlight more than ever. Still on course to take the record for most race starts if the season can deliver enough meetings, Raikkonen is also guaranteed to return points for Alfa.Well beaten by Raikkonen, the Italian needs to step up in his second full season. Unnecessary errors have been costly but he has shown glimpses of pace, particularly in qualifying. Challenging the Finn would be a real achievement.Car VF-20 Engine Ferrari Principal Guenther Steiner Debut Australia 2016 GPs 83 Titles 0 Best finish 5th Last season 9th Gene Haas has warned he will consider Haas’s future in F1 based on how his team perform this season. This year’s car has at least eliminated the tyre-wear problems that plagued them but they do not appear particularly quick. Desperately need their drivers to keep it clean too, if not to further enrage Steiner and Haas.Unforced errors and misjudgments have peppered Grosjean’s career yet can on his day be very quick. Struggled with the car last year but looks more comfortable now, his future in F1 surely depends on consistently delivering this time.K-Mag remains fiercely independent, uncompromising and aggressive. Can be compelling to watch, albeit painfully so sometimes for those on his pitwall. If Haas are in a dogfight at the back of the grid, Magnussen could be the tool they need.Rejoining the midfield is the target after last year’s battering while the proposed sale of the team hangs heavy over them, but they may yet attract the required investment. The car is quicker, has more downforce and is less of a handful to drive, all positive signs. Major advances are not expected but they target making it to Q2 and being in the back-of-the-field fight.Did superbly to weather the storm last year, which he handled impressively. Now team leader, Russell is gaining experience the hard way but he has done so well and his talent will be on show if Williams can get among the other teams.Backed by billionaire father Michael, he drove six practice sessions for Williams last year and is well-liked at the team. A solid pair of hands for a rookie but must rise to the challenge, as Russell did last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cf35ff3dd8e82fe39a25be8502e34ee3451f262/199_49_3834_2302/master/3834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53ebeab79753e3b74a33080b83436b6f","title":"the greatest martina navratilova enduring champion brave herself tennis","story":"The nine-time Wimbledon singles champion’s legacy has never been about only records, titles and longevity. She possessed a power that upended everything: identity  • Who’s your choice? Have your sayHana Mandlikova was an enthusiastic member of the Sparta tennis club in Prague at 12 years old. She acted as ball girl when the ladies played league matches, and there was one young woman whose explosive style of play she admired more than anyone else’s. But Mandlikova was shy, and couldn’t bring herself to speak to her.Eleven years later Mandlikova defeated her hometown hero, Martina Navratilova, in the 1985 US Open final, when the latter was at the peak of her powers. Their match-ups were too few to earn the kind of rivalry immortalised by history. Mandlikova’s Martina moments were squeezed in between Navratilova’s famed decade-long tug-of-war with Chris Evert and the old-timer-newcomer smackdown with Steffi Graf. And yet for a couple of years in the mid-80s, Mandlikova spurred her idol to some extraordinary displays.There was a spectacular semi-final in the 1985 Virginia Slims Championships – where Mandlikova’s ability to stand up to her former countrywoman’s powerful serve sparked fireworks – and a four-set showcase of Navratilova’s shotmaking in the same tournament the following year. Three months later, they met in the 1986 Wimbledon final.Navratilova practically held the lease on Centre Court. She had won six singles titles, the previous four of them in a row. The seven doubles titles were mere window dressing. But Mandlikova broke her first service game, and was 5-2 up at the ball change, Navratilova biting a lip as she walked back to her seat. In the next game, when her opponent hit a backhand return down the line, Navratilova kissed her fingers in appreciation. And then – as if enough was enough – the world No 1 started raining down serves like Jove hurling lightning.What followed was an exhibition of Navratilova’s peak serve-and-volley game. She covered the net with the apparent wing of a Boeing 737 she leapt for the ball like an exploding star. There were impossible pick-ups from her ankles, catapulting cross-court runs and devastating deep-court volleys. Mandlikova kept fighting but she could not fight the hurricane.The following year, Navratilova took her eighth Wimbledon title, against Graf, the 18-year-old wunderkind who had defeated her at Roland Garros and was supposed to herald the end of her reign. Graf kept fighting, too, but the woman 12 years her senior overwhelmed her. As they waited for the trophy presentation, Graf joked: “How many more Wimbledons do you want?”“Nine is my lucky number,” said Navratilova. She got what she wanted.You cannot fight the hurricane. And that’s what Navratilova was destined to be, from the moment she took Evert to three sets in the 1975 French Open, or perhaps the one later that year, when she left her family to become a teenage immigrant with an eastern European accent in a country that didn’t much care for outsiders. It’s what she promised when she served out to love to win her first grand slam in 1978, beating Evert for only the fifth time in 25 attempts, and what she proved in 1984 with her 74-match winning streak, the longest in tennis history.Navratilova’s prominence has never been just about records and titles, although the pure mathematics of her achievements – 167 singles titles, 177 doubles titles, 59 majors – broke every pre-existing algorithm. The magnitude of her career cannot simply be expressed by its longevity, even if she beat the 19-year-old world No 1 Monica Seles in the Paris Open when she was almost twice her age, or lifted the US Open mixed doubles trophy when she was a year off her half-century and her partner, Bob Bryan, looked like a nephew who had come round to help her set up her computer.Navratilova possessed a power that upended everything it blew through a world that wasn’t ready and didn’t know what to call it. We recognise it now as identity – an authenticity of self that our zeitgeist encourages and rewards. But for most of Navratilova’s 31-year career, her iniduality – the one that inspired her to value physical strength and look more muscular than a woman was supposed to, to live openly with a female partner and to speak out for what she believed – carried a personal cost.It’s easy to forget the support and sponsorships she lost, and the suspicion and vilification she attracted, for being unapologetically herself – especially now she is an international treasure, a beloved pundit, a recurring cameo as Gwyneth Paltrow’s lover on a Netflix comedy drama. When Navratilova came out in 1981 it was to a world that associated gay people with Aids and was largely comfortable in its endemic, institutional homophobia. When she criticised the US government, it was to a sporting fanbase that demanded all-American heroes and a media that labelled her unpatriotic.It took time for western culture to catch up with Navratilova’s non-conformity. Her endurance and undying passion to play tennis enriched her legacy, because the longer she continued, the more people were able to appreciate and understand her: the humour and warmth, the soft centre of a personality they once took for severe.Still, her most inspiring attribute has long been apparent. Mandlikova once spoke of her vivid memory of discovering her hero was leaving Czechoslovakia, never to come back. “That,” she said, “that was braveness.” It was the quality that made Navratilova a leader in her time, and for ours.She may have been born in Prague, she may now live in Texas but, to Martina Navratilova, Wimbledon is her spiritual home and the Centre Court crowd her family. ‘I love this place,’ she declared on Saturday.

Tesla does not hold any shares in Treasury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1b395a583f8fcdbf8eab7fffc31e8ff9ff2055/0_0_6944_4167/master/6944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=135b45429e183e8b94433743f7f00cfe","title":"whatsapp groups conspiracy theories disinformation democracy","story":"As social media has become more inhospitable, the appeal of private online groups has grown. But they hold their own dangers – to those both inside and out. By  William DaviesAt first, many of the new uses were heartening. Mutual aid groups sprung up to help the vulnerable. Families and friends used the app to stay close, sharing their fears and concerns in real time. Yet by mid-April, the role that WhatsApp was playing in the pandemic looked somewhat darker. A conspiracy theory about the rollout of 5G, which originated long before Covid-19 had appeared, now claimed that mobile phone masts were responsible for the disease. Across the UK, people began setting fire to 5G masts, with 20 arson attacks over the Easter weekend alone.WhatsApp, along with Facebook and YouTube, was a key channel through which the conspiracy theory proliferated. Some feared that the very same community groups created during March were now accelerating the spread of the 5G conspiracy theory. Meanwhile, the app was also enabling the spread of fake audio clips, such as a widely shared recording in which someone who claimed to work for the NHS reported that ambulances would no longer be sent to assist people with breathing difficulties.This was not the first time that WhatsApp has been embroiled in controversy. While the “fake news” scandals surrounding the 2016 electoral upsets in the UK and US were more focused upon Facebook – which owns WhatsApp – subsequent electoral victories for Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Narendra Modi in India were aided by incendiary WhatsApp messaging, exploiting the vast reach of the app in these countries. In India, there have also been reports of riots and at least 30 deaths linked to rumours circulating on WhatsApp. India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has sought ways of regulating WhatsApp content, though this has led to new controversies about government infringement on civil liberties.As ever, there is a risk of pinning too much blame for complex political crises on an inert technology. WhatsApp has also taken some steps to limit its use as a vehicle for misinformation. In March, a WhatsApp spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company had “engaged health ministries around the world to provide simple ways for citizens to receive accurate information about the virus”. But even away from such visible disruptions, WhatsApp does seem to be an unusually effective vehicle for sowing distrust in public institutions and processes.A WhatsApp group can exist without anyone outside the group knowing of its existence, who its members are or what is being shared, while end-to-end encryption makes it immune to surveillance. Back in Britain’s pre-Covid-19 days, when Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn were the issues that provoked the most feverish political discussions, speculation and paranoia swirled around such groups. Media commentators who defended Corbyn were often accused of belonging to a WhatsApp group of “outriders”, co-ordinated by Corbyn’s office, which supposedly told them what line to take. Meanwhile, the Conservative party’s pro-Brexit European Research Group was said to be chiefly sustained in the form of a WhatsApp group, whose membership was never public. Secretive coordination – both real and imagined – does not strengthen confidence in democracy.WhatsApp groups can not only breed suspicion among the public, but also manufacture a mood of suspicion among their own participants. As also demonstrated by closed Facebook groups, discontents – not always well-founded – accumulate in private before boiling over in public. The capacity to circulate misinformation and allegations is becoming greater than the capacity to resolve them.The political threat of WhatsApp is the flipside of its psychological appeal. Unlike so many other social media platforms, WhatsApp is built to secure privacy. On the plus side, this means intimacy with those we care about and an ability to speak freely on the negative side, it injects an ethos of secrecy and suspicion into the public sphere. As Facebook, Twitter and Instagram become increasingly theatrical – every gesture geared to impress an audience or deflect criticism – WhatsApp has become a sanctuary from a confusing and untrustworthy world, where users can speak more frankly. As trust in groups grows, so it is withdrawn from public institutions and officials. A new common sense develops, founded on instinctive suspicion towards the world beyond the group.The ongoing rise of WhatsApp, and its challenge to both legacy institutions and open social media, poses a profound political question: how do public institutions and discussions retain legitimacy and trust once people are organised into closed and invisible communities? The risk is that a vicious circle ensues, in which private groups circulate ever more information and disinformation to discredit public officials and public information, and our alienation from democracy escalates.The features that would later allow WhatsApp to become a conduit for conspiracy theory and political conflict were ones never integral to SMS, and have more in common with email: the creation of groups and the ability to forward messages. The ability to forward messages from one group to another – recently limited in response to Covid-19-related misinformation – makes for a potent informational weapon. Groups were initially limited in size to 100 people, but this was later increased to 256. That’s small enough to feel exclusive, but if 256 people forward a message on to another 256 people, 65,536 will have received it.Groups originate for all sorts of purposes – a party, organising amateur sport, a shared interest – but then take on a life of their own. There can be an anarchic playfulness about this, as a group takes on its own set of in-jokes and traditions. In a New York Magazine piece last year, under the headline “Group chats are making the internet fun again”, the technology critic Max Read argued that groups have become “an outright replacement for the defining mode of social organization of the past decade: the platform-centric, feed-based social network.”It’s understandable that in order to relax, users need to know they’re not being overheard – though there is a less playful side to this. If groups are perceived as a place to say what you really think, away from the constraints of public judgement or “political correctness”, then it follows that they are also where people turn to share prejudices or more hateful expressions, that are unacceptable (or even illegal) elsewhere. Santiago Abascal, the leader of the Spanish far-right party Vox, has defined his party as one willing to “defend what Spaniards say on WhatsApp”.A different type of group emerges where its members are all users of the same service, such as a school, a housing block or a training programme. A potential problem here is one of negative solidarity, in which feelings of community are deepened by turning against the service in question. Groups of this sort typically start from a desire to pool information – students staying in touch about deadlines, say – but can swiftly become a means of discrediting the institution they cluster around. Initial murmurs of dissatisfaction can escalate rapidly, until the group has forged an identity around a spirit of resentment and alienation, which can then be impossible to dislodge with countervailing evidence.Faced with the rise of new technologies, one option for formal organisations and associations is to follow people to their preferred platform. In March, the government introduced a WhatsApp-based information service about Covid-19, with an automated chatbot. But groups themselves can be an unreliable means of getting crucial information to people. Anecdotal evidence from local political organisers and trade union reps suggests that, despite the initial efficiency of WhatsApp groups, their workload often increases because of the escalating number of sub-communities, each of which needs to be contacted separately. Schools desperately seek to get information out to parents, only to discover that unless it appears in precisely the right WhatsApp group, it doesn’t register. The age of the message board, be it physical or digital, where information can be posted once for anyone who needs it, is over.WhatsApp’s ‘broadcast list’ function, which allows messages to be sent to multiple recipients who are invisible to one another (like email’s ‘bcc’ line), alleviates some of the problems of groups taking on a life of their own. But even then, lists can only include people who are already mutual contacts of the list-owner. The problem, from the point of view of institutions, is that WhatsApp use seems fuelled by a preference for informal, private communication as such. University lecturers are frequently baffled by the discovery that many students and applicants don’t read email. If email is going into decline, WhatsApp does not seem to be a viable alternative when it comes to sharing verified information as widely and inclusively as possible.Groups are great for brief bursts of humour or frustration, but, by their very nature, far less useful for supporting the circulation of public information. To understand why this is the case, we have to think about the way in which iniduals can become swayed and influenced once they belong to a group.The internet has brought with it its own litany of social pathologies and threats. Trolling, flaming, doxing, cancelling and pile-ons are all risks that go with socialising within a vast open architecture. “Open” platforms such as Twitter are reminders that much social activity tends to be aimed at a small and select community, but can be rendered comical or shameful when exposed to a different community altogether.As any frequent user of WhatsApp or a closed Facebook group will recognise, the moral anxiety associated with groups is rather different. If the worry in an open network is of being judged by some outside observer, be it one’s boss or an extended family member, in a closed group it is of saying something that goes against the codes that anchor the group’s identity. Groups can rapidly become dominated by a certain tone or worldview that is uncomfortable to challenge and nigh-impossible to dislodge. WhatsApp is a machine for generating feelings of faux pas, as comments linger in a group’s feed, waiting for a response.This means that while groups can generate high levels of solidarity, which can in principle be put to powerful political effect, it also becomes harder to express disagreement within the group. If, for example, an outspoken and popular member of a neighbourhood WhatsApp group begins to circulate misinformation about health risks, the general urge to maintain solidarity means that their messages are likely to be met with approval and thanks. When a claim or piece of content shows up in a group, there may be many members who view it as dubious the question is whether they have the confidence to say as much. Meanwhile, the less sceptical can simply forward it on. It’s not hard, then, to understand why WhatsApp is a powerful distributor of “fake news” and conspiracy theories.As on open social platforms, one of the chief ways of building solidarity on WhatsApp is to posit some injustice or enemy that threatens the group and its members. In the most acute examples, conspiracy theories are unleashed against political opponents, to the effect that they are paedophiles or secret affiliates of foreign powers. Such plausibly deniable practices swirled around the fringes of the successful election campaigns of Modi, Bolsonaro and Donald Trump, and across multiple platforms.But what makes WhatsApp potentially more dangerous than public social media are the higher levels of trust and honesty that are often present in private groups. It is a truism that nobody is as happy as they appear on Facebook, as attractive as they appear on Instagram or as angry as they appear on Twitter, which spawns a growing weariness with such endless performance. By contrast, closed groups are where people take off their public masks and let their critical guard down. Neither anonymity (a precondition of most trolling) nor celebrity are on offer. The speed with which rumours circulate on WhatsApp is partly a reflection of how altruistic and uncritical people can be in groups. Most of the time, people seem to share false theories about Covid-19 not with the intention of doing harm, but precisely out of concern for other group members. Anti-vaxx, anti-5G or anti-Hillary rumours combine an identification of an enemy with a strong internal sense of solidarity. Nevertheless, they add to the sense that the world is hostile and dangerous.There is one particular pattern of a group chat that can manufacture threats and injustices out of thin air. It tends to start with one participant speculating that they are being let down or targeted by some institution or rival group – be it a public service, business or cultural community – whereupon a second participant agrees. By this stage, it becomes risky for anyone else to defend the institution or group in question, and immediately a new enemy and a new resentment is born. Instantly, the warnings and denunciations emanating from within the group take on a level of authenticity that cannot be matched by the entity that is now the object of derision.But what if the first contributor has misunderstood or misread something, or had a very stressful day and needs to let off steam? And what if the second is merely agreeing so as to make the first one feel better? And what if the other members are either too distracted, too inhibited or too exhausted to say anything to oppose this fresh indignation? This needn’t snowball into the forms of conspiracy theory that produce riots or arson attacks. But even in milder forms, it makes the job of communicating official information – occasionally life-saving information – far more troublesome than it was just a decade ago. Information about public services and health risks is increasingly having to penetrate a thicket of overlapping groups, many of which may have developed an instinctive scepticism to anything emanating from the “mainstream”.Part of the challenge for institutions is that there is often a strange emotional comfort in the shared feeling of alienation and passivity. “We were never informed about that”, “nobody consulted us”, “we are being ignored”. These are dominant expressions of our political zeitgeist. As WhatsApp has become an increasingly common way of encountering information and news, a vicious circle can ensue: the public world seems ever more distant, impersonal and fake, and the private group becomes a space of sympathy and authenticity.This is a new twist in the evolution of the social internet. Since the 90s, the internet has held out a promise of connectivity, openness and inclusion, only to then confront inevitable threats to privacy, security and identity. By contrast, groups make people feel secure and anchored, but also help to fragment civil society into separate cliques, unknown to one another. This is the outcome of more than 20 years of ideological battles over what sort of social space the internet should be.For a few years at the dawn of the millennium, the O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conferences (or ETech), were a crucible in which a new digital world was imagined and debated. Launched by the west coast media entrepreneur Tim O’Reilly and hosted annually around California, the conferences attracted a mixture of geeks, gurus, designers and entrepreneurs, brought together more in a spirit of curiosity than of commerce. In 2005, O’Reilly coined the term “web 2.0” to describe a new wave of websites that connected users with each other, rather than with existing offline institutions. Later that year, the domain name facebook was purchased by a 21-year-old Harvard student, and the age of the giant social media platforms was born.Within this short window of time, we can see competing ideas of what a desirable online community might look like. The more idealistic tech gurus who attended ETech insisted that the internet should remain an open public space, albeit one in which select communities could cluster for their own particular purposes, such as creating open-source software projects or Wikipedia entries. The untapped potential of the internet, they believed, was for greater democracy. But for companies such as Facebook, the internet presented an opportunity to collect data about users en masse. The internet’s potential was for greater surveillance. The rise of the giant platforms from 2005 onwards suggested the latter view had won out. And yet, in a strange twist, we are now witnessing a revival of anarchic, self-organising digital groups – only now, in the hands of Facebook as well. The two competing visions have collided.To see how this story unfolded, it’s worth going back to 2003. At the ETech conference that year, a keynote speech was given by the web enthusiast and writer Clay Shirky, now an academic at New York University, which surprised its audience by declaring that the task of designing successful online communities had little to do with technology at all. The talk looked back at one of the most fertile periods in the history of social psychology, and was entitled “A group is its own worst enemy”.Shirky drew on the work of the British psychoanalyst and psychologist Wilfred Bion, who, together with Kurt Lewin, was one of the pioneers of the study of “group dynamics” in the 40s. The central proposition of this school was that groups possess psychological properties that exist independently of their inidual members. In groups, people find themselves behaving in ways that they never would if left to their own devices.Like Stanley Milgram’s notorious series of experiments to test obedience in the early 60s – in which some participants were persuaded to administer apparently painful electric shocks to others – the mid-20th century concern with group dynamics grew in the shadow of the political horrors of the 30s and 40s, which had posed grave questions about how iniduals come to abandon their ordinary sense of morality. Lewin and Bion posited that groups possess distinctive personalities, which emerge organically through the interaction of their members, independently of what rules they might have been given, or what iniduals might rationally do alone.With the dawn of the 60s, and its more inidualistic political hopes, psychologists’ interest in groups started to wane. The assumption that iniduals are governed by conformity fell by the wayside. When Shirky introduced Bion’s work at the O’Reilly conference in 2003, he was going out on a limb. What he correctly saw was that, in the absence of any explicit structures or rules, online communities were battling against many of the disruptive dynamics that fascinated the psychologists of the 40s.Shirky highlighted one area of Bion’s work in particular: how groups can spontaneously sabotage their own stipulated purpose. The beauty of early online communities, such as listservs, message boards and wikis, was their spirit of egalitarianism, humour and informality. But these same properties often worked against them when it came to actually getting anything constructive done, and could sometimes snowball into something obstructive or angry. Once the mood of a group was erted towards jokes, disruption or hostility towards another group, it became very difficult to wrest it back.Bion’s concerns originated in fear of humanity’s darker impulses, but the vision Shirky was putting to his audience that day was a more optimistic one. If the designers of online spaces could preempt disruptive “group dynamics”, he argued, then it might be possible to support cohesive, productive online communities that remained open and useful at the same time. Like a well designed park or street, a well-designed online space might nurture healthy sociability without the need for policing, surveillance or closure to outsiders. Between one extreme of anarchic chaos (constant trolling), and another of strict moderation and regulation of discussion (acceding to an authority figure), thinking in terms of group dynamics held out the promise of a social web that was still largely self-organising, but also relatively orderly.But there was another solution to this same problem waiting in the wings, which would turn out to be world-changing in its consequences: forget group dynamics, and focus on reputation dynamics instead. If someone online has a certain set of offline attributes, such as a job title, an album of tagged photos, a list of friends and an email address, they will behave themselves in ways that are appropriate to all of these fixed public identifiers. Add more and more surveillance into the mix, both by one’s peers and by corporations, and the problem of spontaneous group dynamics disappears. It is easier to hold on to your self-control and your conscience if you are publicly visible, including to friends, extended family and colleagues.For many of the Californian pioneers of cyberculture, who cherished online communities as an escape from the values and constraints of capitalist society, Zuckerberg’s triumph represents an unmitigated defeat. Corporations were never meant to seize control of this space. As late as 2005, the hope was that the social web would be built around democratic principles and bottom-up communities. Facebook abandoned all of that, by simply turning the internet into a multimedia telephone directory.The last ETech was held in 2009. Within a decade, Facebook was being accused of pushing liberal democracy to the brink and even destroying truth itself. But as the demands of social media have become more onerous, with each of us curating a profile and projecting an identity, the lure of the autonomous group has resurfaced once again. In some respects, Shirky’s optimistic concern has now become today’s pessimistic one. Partly thanks to WhatsApp, the unmoderated, self-governing, amoral collective – larger than a conversation, smaller than a public – has become a dominant and disruptive political force in our society, much as figures such as Bion and Lewin feared.Conspiracy theories and paranoid group dynamics were features of political life long before WhatsApp arrived. It makes no sense to blame the app for their existence, any more than it makes sense to blame Facebook for Brexit. But by considering the types of behaviour and social structures that technologies enable and enhance, we get a better sense of some of society’s characteristics and ailments. What are the general tendencies that WhatsApp helps to accelerate?First of all, there is the problem of conspiracies in general. WhatsApp is certainly an unbeatable conduit for circulating conspiracy theories, but we must also admit that it seems to be an excellent tool for facilitating genuinely conspiratorial behaviour. One of the great difficulties when considering conspiracy theories in today’s world is that, regardless of WhatsApp, some conspiracies turn out to be true: consider Libor-fixing, phone-hacking, or efforts by Labour party officials to thwart Jeremy Corbyn’s electoral prospects. These all happened, but one would have sounded like a conspiracy theorist to suggest them until they were later confirmed by evidence.A communication medium that connects groups of up to 256 people, without any public visibility, operating via the phones in their pockets, is by its very nature, well-suited to supporting secrecy. Obviously not every group chat counts as a “conspiracy”. But it makes the question of how society coheres, who is associated with whom, into a matter of speculation – something that involves a trace of conspiracy theory. In that sense, WhatsApp is not just a channel for the circulation of conspiracy theories, but offers content for them as well. The medium is the message.The full political potential of WhatsApp has not been witnessed in the UK. To date, it has not served as an effective political campaigning tool, partly because users seem reluctant to join large groups with people they don’t know. However, the influence – imagined or real – of WhatsApp groups within Westminster and the media undoubtedly contributes to the deepening sense that public life is a sham, behind which lurk invisible networks through which power is coordinated. WhatsApp has become a kind of “backstage” of public life, where it is assumed people articulate what they really think and believe in secret. This is a sensibility that has long fuelled conspiracy theories, especially antisemitic ones. Invisible WhatsApp groups now offer a modern update to the type of “explanation” that once revolved around Masonic lodges or the Rothschilds.Away from the world of party politics and news media, there is the prospect of a society organised as a tapestry of overlapping cliques, each with their own internal norms. Groups are less likely to encourage heterodoxy or risk-taking, and more likely to inculcate conformity, albeit often to a set of norms hostile to those of the “mainstream”, whether that be the media, politics or professional public servants simply doing their jobs. In the safety of the group, it becomes possible to have one’s cake and eat it, to be simultaneously radical and orthodox, hyper-sceptical and yet unreflective.For all the benefits that WhatsApp offers in helping people feel close to others, its rapid ascendency is one further sign of how a common public world – based upon verified facts and recognised procedures – is disintegrating. WhatsApp is well equipped to support communications on the margins of institutions and public discussion: backbenchers plotting coups, parents gossipping about teachers, friends sharing edgy memes, journalists circulating rumours, family members forwarding on unofficial medical advice. A society that only speaks honestly on the margins like this will find it harder to sustain the legitimacy of experts, officials and representatives who, by definition, operate in the spotlight. Meanwhile, distrust, alienation and conspiracy theories become the norm, chipping away at the institutions that might hold us together. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33ad00411039588c31265caee61df9958e97999/0_41_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b677b8909da8ccc9b9232635f4db4d73","title":"10 of the best uk campsites readers travel tips","story":"Combining open air with social distancing, a stay at a UK campsite will be a popular option this year.

But since mid-May, when the state’s stay-at-home order was lifted, and particularly after the Memorial Day holiday, the demographic has shifted.Snyder says he has seen an “explosion” in cases among 20-44 year-olds.Some of those, he said, are coming in severely ill – requiring oxygen, intubation and ventilators. “We even had people in that age group die, unfortunately. So it’s very troubling and it’s very difficult to watch young people die from this disease. It’s horrible.”Speaking ahead of the July 4 holiday weekend, health experts in hotspot states – which include Arizona, Texas and Florida – warned numbers will continue to rise and that if young people do not take better precautions, hospitals will reach capacity and states could be left with no choice but to completely shut down.Factors thought to have contributed to the surge in cases amongst younger people include graduation parties, mixed public messaging, higher risk tolerance and bars.Around half of Arizona’s almost 80,000 cases fall into the 20-44-year-old age bracket. Nightclubs and bars – closed this week as part of Republican governor Doug Ducey’s “pause” of reopening in an attempt to stop the spread – are the “primary reservoir” for the disease, said Snyder.He wants to see a stay-at-home order and urged young people to stay at home.“The truth is that if we are going to contain this pandemic, if we are going to prevent our hospitals from overflowing, it’s absolutely critical that people in the 20-44-year-old age group take much more precautions than they currently are taking and stay at home.”Some state and federal officials – including Donald Trump - have put the rise in US cases down to increased testing. But Dr Katherine Ellingson, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Arizona, said this is definitely not the case in Arizona, where she said “the rise in Covid testing has not kept pace with the rise in cases”.She said: “The trends are highly concerning … it’s very likely that we will see conditions worsen before they get better.”Between late March and late June, Ellingson said the mean age of new cases in the state dropped from 51 to 38. She puts the change down to a combination of factors including businesses reopening, the end of the stay-at-home order and a general “quarantine fatigue”.She said young people should take precautions including mask wearing, avoiding large gatherings, maintaining physical distance and hand hygiene. She added: “When we look at accounts of super-spreading events we see some common themes: people indoors and in close proximity, doing things like eating, drinking, singing, or exercising.”In Florida, Republican governor Ron DeSantis has acknowledged that cases “are shifting in a radical direction younger”, but this week vowed not to rollback reopening – despite a huge spike in cases.The state has, however, issued a moratorium on consumption of alcohol at bars.Mary Jo Trepka, professor and chair of the department of epidemiology at Florida International University, said the median age of recent cases in the state has been in the 30s. On June 23 it was 33, currently it’s 37.“That means that half of the people are 37 or younger who are testing positive for covid-19,” she said. “That’s really pretty remarkable, how large that number is, especially since you would still think that more frail people would be more likely to be identified because they’re going to have more severe illness.”On Tuesday there were 152,434 total cases in Florida – a rise of 6,012 on the previous day – and 3,505 deaths. Trepka said the true number of cases is likely to be even higher because data undercounts younger people who are more likely to be asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms.“The message early on, probably so people didn’t completely panic, was that ‘OK, this is a lot like the flu, the very elderly are most at risk, but the young people are much less risk’. And while that’s still true of course, once you start getting a lot of young people that are infected, some of those people will be hospitalized and some may die.”The increase in infections among young people poses a significant risk to older people – especially in multi-generational households, which she says is “very worrisome”.While new measures such as the restriction on bars, fines for not wearing masks in Miami Beach and beach closures in some counties may help, Trepka said it will take at least two weeks before their impact is felt. In the meantime, she predicts, cases will continue to go up.“Are we going to have a complete shutdown? I hope not, but it all depends on what happens in the hospitals.”Experts say that bars have become a hotbed for transmission – particularly as people drink and lose their inhibitions.Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease doctor and a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, said bars are “coming up in multiple case investigations”.“Because of the very nature of being at a bar is a social function, it’s much less likely that you’re going to see social distancing be observed there and people, as they drink alcohol, they may talk louder, they may yell, cheer, sing and scream.“It does pose a higher risk for transmission. And most bars are indoors as well.”After stay-at-home orders were lifted, he said many people wrongly took it as a “green light that things were safe”.There was, he added, “a lot of pent-up desire to interact and to go to bars and do things that they couldn’t do for the last couple of months and that’s what you’re seeing – basically like everybody turning 21 all of a sudden”.Bar closures could have some impact, but he fears it could lead to people being “driven underground” to house parties and believes spread among younger age groups will continue which could then start chains of transmission among older and vulnerable people.Dr Spencer Fox, associate director of the UT Austin Covid-19 Modelling Consortium, said: “What we’re seeing in Texas are rises in cases in young people … We’ve seen large upticks in the absolute number of hospital patients who are in younger demographics.”Their current working hypothesis is that younger people, who are lower risk, were more likely to resume socialising when the state started reopening.If action isn’t taken by authorities and younger people continue this behaviour, he said the spread they will “continue to see exponential growth – in cases, infections, hospitalisations and mortality”.Fox also fears it will lead to surges among older age groups too.“I really do hope that seeing upticks in the young population being hospitalised is a wake-up call to people in those age groups, that even though they are maybe less likely to have a negative consequence, it’s still happening, and it’s happening at a rate that is pretty alarming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a330b283a7bfbb25e623a161fd31d6c15facf678/0_0_2987_1793/master/2987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e44b5113db692a3abe018a84ae2d0441","title":"china muslim labor camps uighur hair products","story":"Border officials say shipment contained 13 tons of weaves and other hair products worth $800,000US federal authorities have seized a shipment of products made from human hair believed to have been taken from Muslims in labor camps in China’s western Xinjiang province.Customs and Border Protection officials said that 13 tons (11.8 metric tonnes) of weaves and other hair products worth an estimated $800,000 were in the shipment.“The production of these goods constitutes a very serious human rights violation, and the detention order is intended to send a clear and direct message to all entities seeking to do business with the United States that illicit and inhumane practices will not be tolerated in US supply chains,” said Brenda Smith, executive assistant commissioner of CBP’s office of trade.This is the second time this year that CBP has slapped a rare detention order on shipments of hair products from China, based on suspicions that people making them face human rights abuses.Rushan Abbas, a Uighur American activist whose sister went missing in China almost two years ago and is believed to be locked in a detention camp, said women who use hair weaves should think about who might be making them.“This is so heartbreaking for us,” she said. “I want people to think about the slavery people are experiencing today. My sister is sitting somewhere being forced to make what, hair pieces?”Wednesday’s shipment was made by Lop County Meixin Hair Product Co Ltd. In May, a similar detention was placed on Hetian Haolin Hair Accessories Co Ltd, although those weaves were synthetic, not human, the agency said. Both of the exporters are in China’s far west Xinjiang region, where, over the past four years, the government has detained an estimated 1 million or more ethnic Turkic minorities.Detainees are held in internment camps and prisons where they are subjected to ideological discipline, forced to denounce their religion and language and physically abused. China has long suspected the Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim, of harboring separatist tendencies because of their distinct culture, language and religion.Reports by the AP and other news organizations have repeatedly found that people inside the internment camps and prisons, which activists call “black factories”, are making sportswear and other clothing for popular US brands.The Chinese ministry of affairs has said there is no forced labor, nor detention of ethnic minorities.Xinjiang authorities announced in December that the camps had closed and all the detainees had “graduated”, a claim difficult to corroborate independently given tight surveillance and restrictions on reporting in the region.Some Uighurs and Kazakhs have told the AP that their relatives have been released, but many others say their loved ones remain in detention, were sentenced to prison or were transferred to forced labor in factories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d5ccccc1d87c0e13a6cfb1158a8d61a358bf261/0_48_2885_1731/master/2885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591bb57dc325cbd4b7c29a2e1c0a13a3","title":"data reveals coronavirus hotspots in bradford barnsley and rochdale","story":"Exclusive: figures reveal locations with highest levels of new infections after LeicesterBradford, Barnsley and Rochdale can be revealed as the places with the highest levels of new Covid-19 infections after Leicester, as fears grow of further local outbreaks and the UK heads towards Saturday’s lifting of more lockdown restrictions.The official data, which has not been previously published on Public Health England’s online dashboard, comes amid complaints from local health officials and medics that a lack of detailed testing about local outbreaks is causing delays in attempts to curtail them.It also raises fresh questions about the disproportionate impact of the virus on ethnic minorities, with seven out of 10 of the worst affected areas being in Yorkshire and Lancashire, including some of the most ethnically erse parts of the country.Leicester was locked down on Monday after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the seven-day infection rate was 135 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in the country. Figures from Public Health England now show that rate was even higher in the east Midlands city – just over 140 – in the week ending the previous Sunday, 21 June.Bradford’s rate for that week was 69.4 per 100,000 people, Barnsley’s 54.7 and Rochdale’s 53.6, according to the official figures, which gather together both tests primarily in NHS settings and of healthcare workers and tests carried out in people’s homes and in the community.The two strands are known as pillar-one and pillar-two testing.However, only the pillar-one testing is used in PHE’s online coronavirus dashboard, meaning that the majority of cases in the worst-hit areas are being left off this data. This data did not show that as far back as the week beginning 1 June, PHE knew Leicester was among the two worst affected areas in England.The Leicester MP Liz Kendall said it took “far too long to get even very basic postcode data, which is what we need to identify where the problem is whether it is in schools, whether it is in certain factories and workplaces. You really do need that detail.”Local public health officials and medics have complained that the government has not supplied sufficiently detailed information on local infections, the lack of which they say hampers attempts to quash new outbreaks.Councils have been promised postcode-level data for weeks from Public Health England and the newly created Joint Biosecurity Centre. But some public health directors are concerned the centre has not been sharing data about potential clusters of infections with councils, which could enforce school or workplace closures that could suppress an outbreak at an early stage.“If the only data you’re getting is ‘in this population of 90,000 people there are 40 positives’ it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. If Leicester had got the data sooner they could have had a fighting chance of managing it,” said one public health director, who asked not to be named.The British Medical Association also implored the government to ensure local leaders were given timely information about cases in their area to help contain the spread of the virus.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the BMA Council, said on Wednesday: “The prime minister has talked about a ‘whack-a-mole’ strategy to tackle local outbreaks, but this is no use if the people leading the response on the ground – be they public health teams or local leaders – are not given the most accurate up-to-date data possible. This is crucial to allow swift action and to protect lives and the health service, and something that is not happening right now. This is all the more important given that the ‘world-leading’ test and trace app is not in place, meaning local leaders and teams armed with up-to-date information will be vital in containing spread of outbreaks.”The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has been “working closely with our local partners, providing them with the resources and tools so that they can take swift action to deal with any new local spikes in infection”.In total, there are 47 English local authorities where there are more than 10 cases per 100,000. In a further sign that the disease has shifted away from the capital, not one of these 47 areas was in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f5ddb7046c70d042f7935cfa6298512abc3ed78/0_248_3363_2019/master/3363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70443b1a76e538e990ae58e87bfcdde7","title":"hong kongs security laws usher in new era of chinese control","story":"Beijing’s new rules appear tailored to cover the actions of protesters and their supportersBeijing has imposed a raft of national security rules on Hong Kong, ushering in a new chapter of Chinese control over the semi-autonomous territory once known as a haven of political freedom and civil liberty.Chinese and Hong Kong officials have said the law would target only a “narrow set” of behaviours, but the full text of the legislation – released only after it was enacted late on Tuesday – shows it covers a broad range of activities under vaguely defined crimes related to security. The harshest penalties are life in prison.Legal experts say the most worrying aspect of the legislation is that it brings Chinese law and national security agencies to Hong Kong, eliminating the firewall separating it from mainland China under the “one country two systems” framework. Others say it aims to fundamentally change Hong Kong society with requirements for “national security education” in schools, the media, and the internet.Here are the most concerning parts of the new law:In criminalising secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces to endanger national security, the law is broad enough that it could target forms of what was previously protected speech – like holding up a sign. The rules also appear tailored to encompass the actions of demonstrators and their supporters in protests over the last year.For example, asking foreign organisations or authorities to adopt sanctions against the Hong Kong or Beijing government or generally provoking Hong Kong residents to “hate” the Beijing or Hong Kong government could count as collusion. Vandalising public transport, a tactic used by demonstrators last year, would count as terrorism.The law adopts broad definitions of national security used in mainland China, where such measures are often used against political dissidents. The vagueness of the definitions are all the more concerning because Chinese officials, the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, have ultimate say over interpreting the law.Most of the national security cases will be tried in Hong Kong courts, but the central government can exercise jurisdiction over “complex cases” that involve foreign interference and are difficult for the Hong Kong government to oversee, “serious circumstances” as well as cases where China faces “grave” threats.While the law does not explicitly allow for extradition, it says that China’s supreme people’s court can name “relevant courts” to handle certain trials. Zhang Xiaoming, executive director of the Hong Kong and Macao affairs office, said in a briefing on Wednesday that suspects in these cases would be tried in mainland China.Under the law, the National Security Office, an arm of the Chinese national security services, will be able to operate in Hong Kong,and its agents will be immune from local laws while performing their duties. All Hong Kong government departments are required to cooperate with the office.The office is also charged with taking “necessary measures” to strengthen management of foreign non-governmental organisations and media. In mainland China, national security organs often block both domestic and foreign media, while news outlets and human rights organisations have been able to operate freely and independently in Hong Kong.The law grants a new police department charged with national security cases greater authority to restrict residents from overseas travel, demand service providers to hand over personal information, require foreign political organisations or authorities to hand over information as well as other powers.National security police can also search homes and electronic devices without a warrant, with approval from Hong Kong’s chief executive, as well as conduct covert surveillance and intercept communications.The law allows for trials without jury in cases related to national security that require the protection of “national secrets” or “foreign factors” or the protection of jurors, as approved by Hong Kong’s secretary of justice. In these cases, a panel of three judges is to oversee the case.The press and the public may be barred from observing some cases that involve “state secrets” or risks to public order. Closed-door trials are often used in mainland China in cases involving political dissidents.Legal experts are also concerned about the independence of the courts overseeing national security cases. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who answers directly to Beijing, will designate judges who may be removed if they are seen to endanger national security in speech or behaviour.The law applies to permanent residents and non-residents in Hong Kong who violate the law on Hong Kong territory as well as to crimes committed by a Hong Kong permanent resident outside of the city.Extraordinarily, it also appears to apply to anyone deemed as violating the law regardless of their nationality and where the alleged crime took place. Article 38 of the law state: “This law shall apply to offences … committed against the Hong Kong special administrative region from outside the region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the region.”Donald Clarke, at the George Washington University Law School, wrote in an analysis: “I know of no reason not to think it means what it appears to say: it is asserting extraterritorial jurisdiction over every person on the planet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48879e801ef61fb68ba8540fa54ba437cd18522a/0_374_4865_2919/master/4865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e0662b12ed3c918662a9f6ed53ac53","title":"lenins tomb reopens as russia rushes to return from lockdown","story":"Queues outside Red Square mausoleum are latest sign life in Moscow is getting back to normalAfter months in self-isolation, he’s back. Vladimir Lenin, embalmed and entombed, has reopened to the Russian public, luring bold tourists back to Red Square and down a steep set of mausoleum stairs to his resting place for most of the last 96 years.From early on Wednesday morning, a queue of dozens of people stretched around the mausoleum, past the Kremlin walls and up to the red-bricked historical museum. To see the preserved corpse of the former Soviet leader you must wear a mask, gloves, and pass a temperature check. Inside, visitors reported a pungent smell of cleaning solution, perhaps due to a recent sanitisation.The reopening is another sign that life is getting back to normal in Russia, if normal means displaying a leader who died in 1924 in a glass case to tourists. In a year that has been dominated by coronavirus and a vote to reset Vladimir Putin’s terms as president, the age-old debate over what to do with the Soviet founder’s remains seems quaint, though still isive.“I always think how much longer are we going to get to joke about this,” said Ivan Urgant, a late-night television comedian. “Turns out there are more and more places in Moscow opening up where we can spend time with our families.”The cramped mausoleum’s hasty reopening, even as theatres and cinemas remain closed, however, seemed another instance of Russia’s rushed exit from its coronavirus lockdown.Already, restrictions have been lifted for political reasons: to hold a military parade marking Victory Day and then a nationwide vote to amend the constitution and allow Putin to run for reelection until 2036. The vote, which ends on Wednesday, would leave the president in power longer than Stalin (whose body was also on display alongside Lenin’s until 1961).“Even Lenin’s self-isolation regime was cancelled so that he’d vote for the amendments,” joked Anecdotes from Russia, a popular social media account with 1.4 million followers.Outside, police officers detained eight activists, including members of Pussy Riot, who protested against the vote by lying down on Red Square and using their bodies to spell out “2036”, the year Putin’s sixth term as president could end if he wins the vote as expected.The mausoleum on Red Square has seen several controversies during the coronavirus lockdown.Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist party leader who has run and lost in four presidential elections since 1996, and dozens of his supporters defied a shelter-in-place order in mid-April to lay carnations at Lenin’s mausoleum on the 150th anniversary of his birth.During Russia’s Victory Day parade, a military spectacle rescheduled to 24 June this year because of the pandemic, the mausoleum was once again covered up, this year with pictures and illustrations of soldiers.Zyuganov described the cover-up as “unacceptable”, noting that Soviet leaders had watched the first parade from atop the structure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/897d6f2eb71ed902c0c0d9a2f0bed887eb2a3a49/92_2_1177_706/master/1177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fad1da75942b6f6683e99e9b0db4ff8","title":"oxford offers best hope for a covid 19 vaccine this year mps told","story":"University is leading rivals but first drugs may not work fully, says vaccine taskforce chairOxford University is leading the world in developing a vaccine against Covid-19 and offers the best chance of having something protective against the virus as we go into winter, MPs have been told.Kate Bingham, chair of the UK vaccine taskforce, said she expected to have a vaccine “early next year” from one or more of the candidates, although it was possible the first vaccines might only “help alleviate the symptoms” so that people have a less serious bout of disease, rather than fully protecting them.Asked whether the UK would have to face the winter without a vaccine, Bingham said the best chance lay with the vaccine being trialled by Prof Sarah Gilbert from Oxford University, which is ahead of the rest.“I hope we can improve on those timelines and come to your rescue,” Gilbert told the science and technology committee but would not be drawn on how much sooner the vaccine might be ready.Physical distancing had reduced the numbers of people getting infected in the UK, which was good news, she said, but made it harder to trial a vaccine so they were now also testing it in Brazil and South Africa, where the case numbers are high. Astra Zeneca, the company that has partnered with Oxford, is to start a trial with 30,000 people in the US.Bingham said Gilbert’s team was a long way ahead of the field. “The Oxford study will have likely vaccinated all their efficacy subjects before any of the other vaccines actually start their big efficacy trials. So that just gives you a scale of how far ahead they are versus the other companies,” she said.Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, criticised the lack of pandemic planning in the UK and particularly the absence of manufacturing capacity for vaccines.“I don’t think we had particularly confident or extensive planning for any pandemic, to be honest,” he told the committee. “People occasionally talked about flu but very little was done. I think we weren’t really ready for a pandemic in the UK. And I think that’s something that we need to pay very close attention to.”The UK had shown its ability to be ahead of the rest of the world in scientific research and clinical trials for vaccines, he said.“So I think we have to go back and think about how our healthcare system and our public health system thinks much more strategically about how we get ready for pandemics, rather than try to react after they’ve arrived on the doorstep, because I think that’s where the problem was.”Bell said the UK was “pretty complacent” about its manufacturing capacity for vaccines before the pandemic.“Our vaccine manufacturing capability was allowed to drift and was pretty lamentable at the beginning of this,” he said. “You don’t want to rely on importing vaccine from the US because you’re not going to get it at this stage.”This pandemic was “not a one-off” that would not recur for centuries, he said.“Since 2000 we’ve had eight close calls, which should have made us wake up. We’ve had three flu epidemics or near-flu epidemics, two Sars episodes, one Mers episode, Zika and Ebola, and any one of those could have blown up to be exactly what we’ve got now, so this needs become part of our national health security infrastructure.”He said it would be important to immunise as many vulnerable and older people as possible against flu before the winter. At the moment Australia, which usually experiences first the strains of flu the UK can expect, is not having a bad season.“But then there are these reports coming out of China about a new flu strain, which is a swine flu strain, which always worry you, because many of these strains do emerge out of China,” Bell said.“Whatever happens is likely to happen through the autumn, getting into the winter, and we’ll have a whole new set of other respiratory viruses floating around and if we happen to have a bad flu season, it will cause lots of trouble and there will be a real challenge, you know doing diagnostics separating the flu from the Covid patients doing all that kind of stuff. So, so we need to be on the front foot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1328b11432b923711a5ffbd33d91d303988bf7fd/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=88889c6f9dc52df7c23513803bb6b570","title":"why is there a delay in sharing covid 19 test data with english councils","story":"Attempts to suppress localised flare-ups hampered by failure to share detailed informationAttempts to contain regional outbreaks of coronavirus are being hampered by a failure to share comprehensive test results with local health authorities. Beyond Leicester, where lockdown restrictions are being reimposed, there are fears of further flare-ups, with Bradford, Barnsley and Rochdale all recording high levels of infection. Testing capacity has expanded dramatically in recent months, so why are the results not being acted upon faster?When the outbreak began, the most comprehensive testing was directed at Covid-19 patients in hospitals. The tests look for live infection by detecting traces of the virus’s genetic code on swabs taken from the nose and throat. The swabs are processed at regional labs run by Public Health England or at NHS labs across the country. As capacity ramped up, these labs expanded their testing to key healthcare workers. This is known as pillar one of the national testing programme.More facilities were set up to provide tests for other key workers and these have enabled testing to be rolled out to far more people. The swabs are taken at drive-through and walk-in centres, by mobile units, or in the home, and are processed by the Lighthouse megalabs set up in Milton Keynes, Alderley Park, Glasgow and Cambridge. This is pillar two of the national testing programme.Further tests are performed for disease surveillance purposes, such as the weekly virus and antibody tests run by the Office for National Statistics. These give scientists an idea of how prevalent the disease is in the community – and so whether the epidemic is growing or in decline – and what proportion of the population have had the virus and recovered.Beyond the immediate medical value of knowing a person is infected, coronavirus tests are fundamental to keeping the disease under control as the UK emerges from lockdown. Testing revealed an outbreak at Weston general hospital, in Weston-super-Mare, in May, a localised flare-up that was tackled by closing the hospital temporarily for a deep clean. But the need to reimpose lockdown on Leicester this week because of an outbreak shows that the system is not working as it should.A number of factors, such as population density, probably contributed to the outbreak in the first place. But arguably more important is why the outbreak was acted on so late, a full 11 days after it was spotted.Local health officials say the problem arose because they were not given access to accurate and up-to-date information on where the infections were. It meant that the local public health team had to contain an outbreak without knowing precisely the sources. Sir Peter Soulsby, the mayor of Leicester, complained that the council had tried for weeks to find out detailed test results in the city.The problem is that while some results are passed straight to regional public health authorities, others are often held back. A common situation is that local health teams receive only pillar one test results, which help them clamp down on outbreaks in hospitals and care homes. But the pillar two results, which show who has tested positive in the community, are only shared if the recipient has signed the Data Protection Act. This means that local health authorities may have only patchy data on who is infected in their area.Prof Deenan Pillay, a virologist at University College London, said: “The data problem has probably spawned a whole load of other infections in Leicester which could of course lead to deaths.” One senior director of public health told the  it made dealing with outbreaks like “playing a game of battleships”.Public Health England has just signed a number of data sharing agreements with local authorities that, in principle at least, should give regional public health teams swift access to comprehensive and up-to-date test results.

Critics say the law gives authorities sweeping new powers to crack down on dissent and a new level of Chinese control over the semi-autonomous territory.On Thursday, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said his country was working on a scheme to provide a safe haven to Hong Kong residents after China’s “very concerning” decision. Morrison said Australia was “prepared to step up and provide support”, although his cabinet was yet to finalise the details, including whether the scheme would include a pathway to permanent settlement.On Wednesday, Raab admitted there was little Britain could do to “coercively force” China if it tried to block take-up of the government’s visa pledge.He told ITV’s Peston programme: “Ultimately if they follow through on something like that there would be little that we could do to coercively force them.”Raab continued: “There is an issue around freedom and human rights in Hong Kong, and there is an issue around China keeping its word on an international obligation it made to the United Kingdom back in 1984.“I wouldn’t want to be naive about this: I think we need to be realistic. But I do think that China as a rising, leading member of the international community is sensitive to the reputational risk in all of this but clearly not sufficiently that it hasn’t proceeded anyway ... There is diplomatic leverage, there are other ways that we can persuade China not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about.“But ultimately we need to be honest that we wouldn’t be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.”Johnson has said he will honour a promise to change immigration rules to allow holders of British Nationals (Overseas) passports, as well as those eligible for the passport, to reside in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship.The UK government believes the new security legislation passed by Beijing breaches the Sino-British joint declaration, which aimed to smooth the transition when the territory was handed back to China in 1997.As of February, there were nearly 350,000 BNO passport holders, while the government estimated there are around 2.9 million BNOs living in Hong Kong.Asked how many people the government anticipated would come to the UK from Hong Kong, Raab said: “It’s difficult to give a precise forecast but I think it is fair to assume that only a proportion of those that are offered the new status that we set out in the House of Commons today will take it up.”He said he was working with other countries in the region to discuss a lifeboat operation. He said: “We think the majority will probably hunker down in Hong Kong, and others would leave to other countries in the region.”Downing Street said those with BNO status will be eligible to travel to the UK immediately before the details of the scheme are finalised “in the coming weeks” and that they will not face salary thresholds.The security law in Hong Kong criminalises a broad swathe of behaviours deemed as succession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Hong Kong police made their first arrests on Wednesday under the new law, including a 15-year old girl waving a Hong Kong independence flag.Liu was summoned to the Foreign Office on Wednesday, where the permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, told him the imposition of the new legislation on Hong Kong breaches the Sino-British joint declaration.Following his visit, Liu tweeted: “After turbulent months in the latter half of last year, the national security law will bring the order＆stability to Hong Kong and get its economy back on track.”China views its actions as one of the last steps towards decolonisation, but an early test of its willingness to preserve the country’s freedoms will come in the autumn elections for the legislature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52fcb5b36c470950d14579ebcad0278678b6a02/0_12_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=215e33a4f91962ee76cf6b407f06f926","title":"david clarks resignation inevitable as ardern seeks to restore trust","story":"New Zealand’s handling of coronavirus was besmirched by health minister’s blunders, so a pre-election salvage operation was neededNew Zealanders had been confined to their homes for more than two weeks when photographs emerged of David Clark’s campaign van parked at a mountain-biking track in Dunedin.His vehicle was the only one there.The health minister had flouted lockdown rules to hit the tracks at Signal Hill, angering the general public who by and large were adhering to the strict guidelines to stay at home and only take exercise locally.The prime minister chastised Clark and demoted him, but stopped short of stripping him of his portfolio, saying she didn’t want to rock the boat during the crisis.Ten days later when Clark owned up to another lockdown breach – driving his family to a beach 20km from his home – public outrage reached fever pitch, and calls for his resignation became shouts. Clark offered Ardern his resignation, but she refused – a decision for which she is now being criticised by the opposition.“At a time when we are asking New Zealanders to make historic sacrifices I’ve let the team down. I’ve been an idiot, and I understand why people will be angry with me,” Clark said in a statement at the time.“As the health minister, it’s my responsibility to not only follow the rules but set an example to other New Zealanders.”New Zealand’s efforts to halt coronavirus in its tracks have been praised around the globe. Earlier this month the country effectively eliminated the virus, and infections were kept below 1,500, and fatalities at 22.But New Zealand’s success at containing the virus seems to owe little to the country’s health minister.In early June it was revealed that two British women were released from border quarantine early without being tested. They then proceeded to travel around the North Island – and were eventually found to be positive for Covid-19.The women’s situation wasn’t an isolated incident. A shambolic border quarantine process has seen dozens of people released from hotel quarantine without being tested, and the health ministry then began a frenzied search to track them, contain them, and test.Clark fronted a press conference last week to explain the bungles, but instead of owning up to mistakes, he blamed Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the much-admired director general of health who had guided Kiwis through the lockdown and earned millions of fans.Social media users were horrified on the health official’s behalf. His face had been “heartbreaking”, said one “like kicking a puppy”, said another. “Is Dr Bloomfield OK?” asked a third.The backlash against Clark was immediate, with political commentators calling his conduct “brutal”, and saying he had thrown Bloomfield under a bus.His tenure then began to be seen as a major liability for Ardern’s re-election chances in September, as well as her global credibility as one of the first countries to eliminate the virus.Clark’s resignation – whether it was voluntary or not – was welcomed in New Zealand, with political insiders calling it a critical and necessary step to salvage the government’s reputation in handling the crisis.One political commentator, Neale Jones, said it was an “honourable decision”, while RNZ’s Jane Patterson described it as “inevitable”.“Momentum against Clark had been building,” writes Patterson, saying his lockdown breaches were “a huge embarrassment to the government”.Clark has said he intends to stand for re-election at local and government level. But with his lockdown breaches one of the biggest scandals of New Zealand’s otherwise playbook perfect handling of the pandemic, he will have a hard task winning back the public’s hearts and minds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78c18a381a21f7aa2315a0d5978457ddea4a8bfb/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c25d0fecf5fd578be2e523bc62f9c06","title":"hong kong football fan briefly detained after shouting long live liverpool","story":"Police reportedly interrogated lifelong fan who said he ‘felt an urge’ to voice his joy at club winning Premier League titleHong Kong media say police briefly detained a man in a Liverpool FC shirt who shouted “long live Liverpool” during anti-government protests on Wednesday, over suspicion he was inciting independence.More than 370 people have been arrested in Hong Kong protests, including at least 10 for offences under the newly enacted national security laws which came into effect late on Tuesday night.According to In-Media, the man was across the street from police officers who were conducting stop-and-searches on a group of protesters, when he shouted “long live Liverpool!” Others reportedly cheered and joined in the chant, before officers detained him.The man told In-Media police had accused him of inciting Hong Kong independence – a now punishable crime.He said he had been a fan of the English football team for 30 years and “felt an urge” to voice his feelings over their recent Premier League win. Ten minutes after his initial detention, he was released.Thousands marched on Wednesday in defiance of protest bans and police warnings that acts of secession, including waving pro-independence flags or shouting slogans, could see them charged. They were met with tear gas, water cannon, pepper spray and pepper balls.The majority of those arrested were for unlawful assembly, disorderly conduct in public, dangerous driving and possessing offensive weapons, the police force said.However six men and four women were also arrested under the national security law. Police did not provide information on the inidual offences. Earlier reports said those arrested included a 15-year-old girl, and a man who held a “Hong Kong Independence” flag, later revealed to have the words “no to” written in tiny lettering before the slogan.Another man was seen being detained after police discovered a number of Taiwan flags in his possession. It is not clear if the two flag-bearing men were among the final 10.The national security law, enacted in just six weeks in an opaque legislative process in Beijing, went into effect at 11pm on Tuesday. The full details of the law were published afterwards. On Wednesday afternoon Hong Kong’s security secretary, John Lee defended police arresting people under a law no one was familiar with.“We will do education, but if something has outrageously broken the Hong Kong law, then the police have a duty to take action.”Lee was explicit about the law’s aims to crush any community sentiments for independence.“With education prevention and enforcement we can turn the tide to let people know that protection on national security is everybody’s responsibility, and that advocacy for independence in hong kong is against the law.”Hong Kong police have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6700a0b03a8fbcbc75d275a2f5d64341d02ac551/0_390_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4027fd8c4bc153ee461e43577763c041","title":"new zealand unveils plans to tackle trade in bones of extinct moa birds","story":"Crackdown on illegal excavation and smuggling amid fears that scientific and historic heritage is being lostNew Zealand’s conservation minister has released plans to tackle the lucrative trade in the bones of the extinct giant flightless moa bird amid fears that millions of years of science is disappearing as entire skeletons are broken up and sold over the internet or smuggled overseas.Palaeontologists have been lobbying the government for years to crack down on the trade, with fossils illegally excavated and poached from crown land.Since 2010, museum scientists have documented more than 350 instances of moa bones and eggshells being offered for sale, and in many cases they have identified that these items have been recently removed from protected sites.“Taking bones and eggshells from protected areas is against the law. It harms Aotearoa New Zealand’s cultural, scientific and historic heritage and destroys irreplaceable scientific information” said Sage.“The proposals to use regulations under the Wildlife Act to prohibit the sale of the remains of extinct species, with some special exceptions, would remove the financial incentive that leads a few selfish people to vandalise our natural and cultural heritage.”Moa, giant flightless birds which stood up to 3.6 metres tall, were endemic to New Zealand and became extinct about 500 to 600 years ago. When they were first discovered by Europeans they were considered a scientific marvel and kickstarted a global frenzy, as museums competed to acquire specimens.Under New Zealand law it is legal to sell moa bones and eggshells found on private land. There is no requirements for experts to sample or study the bones, or survey the site, as is standard practice in the UK and many other countries. In November last year a private collector in Britain purchased an entire moa skeleton for $34,000.Although it is illegal to sell or collect moa bones from public conservation land, experts and the department of conservation say looters routinely plunder caves and swamps for remains, which in their entirety can fetch between $20,000 and $50,000, or between $70 and $350 per bone.There have been incidents of entire skeletons appearing in European auction houses with suspect or unknown origins, according to a moa expert, Trevor Worthy.Trade Me, New Zealand’s version of eBay, has hosted hundreds of moa bone and egg sales over the past five years, and requires no evidence or documentation from sellers that their bones were collected legally.Concerned museum curators and palaeontologists say bones sold to private collectors are essentially “garbage”, because without the correct handling and storage they will disintegrate in a matter of decades. Richard Holdaway, a palaeontologist, said private sales should be banned. “Moa bones do not belong to iniduals, they belong to the country,” he said. “There are never going to be any more Moa – every bone sold and destroyed is one less than there will ever be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9595f4d92de94e0146aab5ec03ae7251fd3dd562/0_45_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93de4a0e16a65e435157d45ad1349b52","title":"no kissing amsterdams red light district reopens after coronavirus shutdown","story":"Sex workers welcome the chance to earn again but with strict rules about face-to-face contact, hygiene and making clients check for symptomsAmsterdam’s famed red light district has reopened after a long coronavirus shutdown, with sex workers and clients having to observe new rules to prevent infection.The Netherlands ordered all brothels closed in mid-March and had originally planned to keep them shut until September, but recently brought the date forward as Covid-19 cases dropped.Felicia Anna, a 34-year-old Romanian sex worker, said it “felt very good” to be back at work.“During the lockdown, a lot of sex workers ran into financial trouble so we’re very happy that we can finally start our job again,” Anna, chairwoman of the Red Light United trade union, said.She said there were fears that there would be fewer clients, since many of them are tourists and the Netherlands still has a travel ban on many countries.“But I did ask some of my colleagues and so far they said that the work is quite ok.”“I’m totally booked” for Wednesday, added Foxxy, a sex worker and activist at the Prostitution Information Center in Amsterdam, using her professional pseudonym.She “had a little party” when she heard the government’s 24 June announcement that sex work could restart, added Foxxy, who rents a room in a brothel outside the red light district.While less restrictive than other countries, the Netherlands’ “intelligent lockdown” emptied the red neon-lit, street-front windows from which many of Amsterdam’s prostitutes normally beckon customers.Now they are reopening but, as with Dutch hairdressers and masseurs which have already been allowed to resume operations, sex workers are encouraged to verify that their clients do not have Covid-19 symptoms.“Before I make an appointment, I have to check with the client if they’re feeling ok and if they don’t have any of the symptoms, or if any of their housemates has symptoms,” Foxxy said.Other measures include “disinfection and washing the hands, cleaning the sheets after every appointment. Those are the basic needs. But we don’t need to wear any face masks during the playdates, thank God”.She added that “most of us will avoid face to face, so no kissing”.Felicia Anna said that “after the customer leaves the room, we’re going to disinfect everything he might have touched, bed, sink, the toilet if he used the toilet, the doorknobs, everything”.But she said that sex workers were already well versed in hygiene, adding: “We already dealt with much bigger diseases than corona.”Dutch deputy prime minister Hugo de Jonge said on Wednesday that a “new phase in the approach to coronavirus begins” but urged people to remain vigilant.The Netherlands legalised prostitution in 2000 and sex workers have to register with the local chamber of commerce and pay income tax. Around 7,000 now work in Amsterdam, according to official figures.Anna said the red light district would “certainly” be more affected because “a lot of sex workers” who often come from eastern Europe and South America returned to their home countries during the lockdown and are still not allowed to travel back to the Netherlands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c51b02524f2fdda2982d2ac8712cb2fae1a3a46/0_215_3222_1933/master/3222.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=11a23b3a08afe130c1e8afe1ced0c9a0","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about itFrom this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

There has been some speculation Blackman was considering running for Holyrood in the 2021 elections.The environment will finally get a look-in at Westminster today too: the shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has stood firm on the 2019 manifesto pledge on carbon emission, meaning Labour is committed to reaching a “substantial majority” of UK. decarbonization by 2030 at the last election. Campaigners, however, were concerned by reports that new leader Keir Starmer might rethink the plan. But on a call with more than 150 activists from the Labour for a Green New Deal campaign last night, Miliband said: “I don’t resile one iota from the manifesto.” He said the pledge was “completely right on the ambition we need over the next decade”, and added: “I’m not in this job to scale back on ambition.”So. Putting glitz and glamour firmly put back in its box, let’s look at what’s happening in Westminster today. The under-fire housing secretary (he’s facing accusations of making an unlawful decision to help a Conservative donor dodge a multimillion-pound tax bill), Robert Jenrick, will address the Local Government Association conference this afternoon at an online event.He’ll be grilled by councillors at a Q\u0026ampA - expect questions about the upcoming changes to planning laws (as well as why Jenrick failed to listen to the objections of councillors over the controversial Westferry development.) Perhaps worth noting is that an announcement on local government funding is expected today. Jenrick has a written statement listed on the Commons order paper.I’m struggling to get some cheery glitz and glamour into today’s live blog - we all like a bit of glamour - but my best effort is a letter penned by Paul McCartney, who has joined 1,500 other artists, including the Rolling Stones and Iron Maiden, to urge Oliver Dowden to step in and help support a music business battered by the pandemic, after festival season was cancelled. The BBC has a write-up. Dowden tweeted a response last night. Penpals in the making, perhaps? One of the perks of being culture secretary. In what is hardly a break for good news, it might nevertheless be worth stepping back from this morning’s breaking news for just a moment to flag a damning scoop from Channel 4 last night, which revealed the Department of Health issued safety warnings and orders to frontline staff to bin tens of thousands of protective masks and respirators that were deemed unsafe.Something else that isn’t happening - at least any more - is a tweet from the Treasury that invited Brits to “grab a drink and raise a glass” when pubs open on Saturday. Forced to delete it last night, a screenshot has ensured the department can be still be roundly criticised for the tweet amid fears of alcohol-fuelled carnage at the weekend. TV arguments man Piers Morgan was among those expressing outrage.If you missed it, here’s the tweet:And here is our full report:Now. Before we turn to else is happening today, let’s look at what isn’t happening. What isn’t happening is the announcement on travel corridors, which is now set for Friday. The Times reckons around 95 countries will be on the final list — which is half of the entire world. That, alongside the BBC failing to find a single police force which has issued a quarantine fine, suggests the former transport minister Theresa Villiers might be right when she says the whole thing wasn’t worth the damage to the industry. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, will take questions in the Commons at 9.30am, so watch this space for more on that.Something else the report shows is that in Leicester, new infections are concentrated in a few areas and focused among children and working-age people. It points out that the “evidence for the scale of the outbreak is limited and may, in part, be artificially related to growth in availability of testing.” So. Looking at local lockdowns - the other issue dominating the news today. The government last night slipped out the “rapid investigation team” report. It’s the motherlode of data that informed the decision to impose further measures in Leicester. The , the only paper to clearly frame the report as showing progress, quotes former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith branding it “very good news”.Other papers note that the government will be hoping the headlines today focus on schools - and not on unemployment and local lockdowns. It’s already fighting what might turn out to be a losing battle on that front: the papers this morning aren’t exactly holding back, with the Express screaming “VIRUS HOTSPOTS ON THE BRINK OF LOCKDOWN” on its front page and the  reporting, in its own splash, that the UK could be “days away” from further local restrictions. There’s also a lot of fake information going around to combat too, as the BBC reports. But what isn’t fake news is polling for the ITV Peston show by JL Partners, which found three-quarters of people believe there will be a second lockdown this year - and more people would blame the public for a second coronavirus wave than the government’s handling of the crisis.But if children do see themselves back at home, the government is going to have to up its game regarding home learning: it has already missed its target of sending out 230,000 laptops to the kids most in need of equipment. And it’s not plain sailing for schools who have received the computers: The Times reports that some schools have received the devices but have not been given the passwords to access them. “It’s been a shambles of the highest order — whilst the Department for Education fumbles the digital ide grows by the day,” an academy trust leader said.But the Mail goes on, it does look like the government will have to do all it can to ensure schools stay open after criticism for getting pubs and zoos up and running again first. It carries bullish quotes from a ‘Cabinet source’ who says that: “even if the R number is up near one, I think people are clear that schools have to reopen,” the source said. “That might mean something else closing in order to keep the overall risk at an acceptable level, but schools will reopen.”The Mail, however, is uncharacteristically cautious - warning that all this school stuff is just speculation until the final document is actually published in August. That will depend on how the pandemic is looking at that point. Schools, the paper says, could find that everything said this morning is just words, words, words - carelessly cast to the wind when push comes to shove. I believe it has happened before...Still on schools: assemblies will be banned and teachers are being told to prepare for an increase in bad behaviour from kids unnerved by the change in routine. Officials were last night playing down claims that the curriculum could be restricted, as has been reported in recent days.According to the latest reports in the , schools will have to close if just two pupils get the virus - although hopefully the year group ‘bubbles’ will lessen the chance of that happening. Today’s government guidance will include orders to improve online learning so a full curriculum can be taught if pupils are sent home temporarily due to a local outbreak. Schools will also see health protection teams waiting on the sidelines, poised to sweep in to conduct mass testing if case numbers look concerning.And then this afternoon, Gavin Williamson - who is having a busy day - will be back to host an ad-hoc Downing Street press conference. It’s the first since the daily update was ditched over a week ago, so hopes are high for an equally thrilling second series.There’s a lot of coronavirus news coming up today, starting with the expectation that the government will tell schools in England to overhaul the curriculum, stagger break times and group children into “bubbles” when they return to the classroom in September.At 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics will release data on its coronavirus infection survey, economic impact and housing indicators. A Test and Trace update expected late morning. At 11.30am, the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will give that speech on the autumn opening of education settings. At 12.30am, the Royal Society of Medicine will discuss the impact of Covid-19 on the elderly. Moving on to this afternoon, at 2pm Public Health England will publish its coroanvirus surveillance report on cases up to 28 June - and at the same time, the Joint Human Rights committee will launch its report into the life of children whose mothers are in prison during coronavirus.In Scotland, the Scottish Affairs committee will report on the impact of lockdown at 2.30pm.

More than 6,000 were lost on Wednesday, bringing the total this week to at least 10,000. The latest casualties will include workers at Arcadia group, SSP, Harrods and John Lewis. The news comes as the International Monetary Fund’s chief economist said the UK should should prioritise spending on green projects to create jobs and kickstart the economic recovery. Gita Gopinath said mounting unemployment would require swift action to prevent lasting damage. The Treasury seemed to regret its push to get people to spend in pubs, when it deleted a tweet calling on patrons to “raise a glass” when doors reopen on Saturday in England. Critics said it was in poor taste, given the 43,000 deaths during caused by the pandemic. A\u0026ampE doctors pleaded with revellers not to ‘“get plastered” on so-called “Super Saturday”, as the NHS is already overstretched. Police will step up patrols and also urged patrons to drink responsibly.Abroad, and the US has recorded another daily high in cases, this time 52,000 for Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins figures. It came after Donald Trump told Fox Business he still believed the virus would disappear, adding: “And I think we’re going to have a vaccine very soon too.” California ordered the closure of restaurants, bars and indoor venues.There’s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down … and here’s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak – from breaking news to factchecks and advice."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293827.1593631616!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pods bubbles staggered drop offs reopening schools in a brave new world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrimary school pupils and their teachers will be encouraged to form class bubbles or groupings which stay apart from other classes as much as possible. File photograph: Getty With less than eight weeks to go before the start of the new school year, health authorities have released interim guidelines for the safe reopening of schools. Once implemented, school life will look very different than before. Here are some of the key recommendations:Social distancingPrimary: A\u0026nbspdistance of one metre should be maintained between desks or between inidual pupils. Given that younger children are unlikely to maintain physical distancing indoors, this recommendation will not apply to the first four years of primary school (junior infants to second class).Secondary: Physical distancing of two metres where possible or at least one metre should be maintained between students or staff. Schools should consider moving to inidual desks and chairs for students.Class bubblesPrimary: Pupils and their teachers will be encouraged to form class bubbles or groupings which stay apart from other classes as much as possible. Within each class, there may be pods or smaller groups, which should stay at least one metre away from other pods.Secondary: As far as possible students should remain in the classroom and teachers would move between rooms. Double classes, where possible, would minimise movement during the day. In cases where students have to change classroom, hand washingsanitising is required by both teachers and students.Dropping offpicking up childrenWalkingcycling to school should be encouraged. To avoid congregation at school gates, schools should consider staggered drop-offpick-up times opening up additional entrances or access points and instructing pupils to head straight for the classroom.For those arriving by car, parents may be encouraged to park further away from the school and then walk with their children to avoid congestion.Face masksStudents: It is not practical for many students to wear a mask properly for the duration of a school day. Older students should not be requested to wear a facial covering, but those who may wish to may do so.Teachers: Face coverings for teachers are not, in general, considered necessary, as they conceal facial expression and can make communication difficult.However, wearing a visor may be an appropriate alternative in situations where there may be behavioural issues or tending to intimate care needs.GlovesUse of disposable gloves in schools by pupils or teachers is not appropriate.Temperature checksOn-site temperature taking is not recommended because fever is not a consistent symptom of Covid-19 in children and would result in delayed school entry.Hand hygienePupils and staff should wash or sanitise their hands on arrival at school before eating or drinking after using the toilet after petting animals and after playing outdoors.Sharing books or devicesArt students should be encouraged to have their own art supplies. Shared electronics such as tablets and keyboards should be cleaned between use. Musical instruments should not be shared between students, if possible.Textbooks that are shared should be covered in a wipeable plastic covering that can be wiped with cleaning agent between uses. Sharing of sports equipment should also be minimised.Rules for teaching staffTwo metres is recommended for physical distancing by staff on breaks or arriving for work. Breaks should be staggered. At post-primary level, the formation of school staff “pods”, or teams who work together and take breaks together, should be considered. Staff meetings may be held remotely, or in small groups or in large spaces to facilitate physical distancing.CanteensSchools should ensure that physical distancing is applied in canteen facilities, with classes or groupings served at different times on a staggered basis.Break timesThe risk of virus transmission due to contact with outside surfaces or play areas is low. However, schools should aim to keep groups together, to stagger breaktimes and to promote outdoor access.Choir practicemusicChoir practicesperformances and music practicesperformances involving wind instruments may pose a higher level of risk and special consideration should be given to how they are held, ensuring the room is well ventilated and distancing between performers is maintained.SportSchools should follow the existing advice of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre’s guidelines for return to sports activities, which advise socially distanced training.Cleaning regimesSchools should also consider ways of reducing the need for touching objects by installing no-touch waste containers, propping doors open, and using sensor-operated hand towels.Where possible the keeping open of doors and windows should be encouraged to increase natural ventilation and to reduce contact with door handles.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"From planting to organising the kids\u0026rsquo room, there are lots of ways to keep plastic out of landfillOne Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation Plan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

We are acutely aware of this and we would ask you to bear with us.’  Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Government is finalising “a roadmap” for safe overseas travel “very shortly”, the assistant general secretary at the Department of the Taoiseach has said.Liz Canavan told the Government’s Covid-19 briefing on Wednesday that the advice is still to avoid non-essential travel abroad.She said that this week at least six cases of coronavirus recorded are related to international travel and reminded the public that the early cases of the disease in Ireland were “associated with international travel”.Last week the Government said foreign travel restrictions would be eased from July 9th, with travellers permitted to move between countries on a “green list” with similar levels of coronavirus infection.At the end of the week, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) came out strongly against resumed overseas travel.The State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, said that the public health advice was still against non-essential international travel, and he urged people to cancel their foreign holidays to avoid importing more cases into the State.A quarter of new cases confirmed last week were linked to overseas travel.On Wednesday Ms Canavan said that the Government understands the issue of foreign travel was causing “great uncertainty and worry”.“Some people have holidays booked and are wondering what to do. We are acutely aware of this and we would ask you to bear with us,” she said.ResurgenceMs Canavan said new outbreaks of the virus in other countries in recent weeks shows “how easy it is for this virus to begin to take hold again” and that countries that have had a low incidence were now seeing a resurgence.She warned, “Complacency is our biggest enemy now.”Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall said that the “mixed messages” from the Government and Dr Holohan were “leading to confusion and concern among the public”.She called on the Government to take immediate action on foreign travel to prioritise public health and to provide clarity to the public.“We currently have no effective way of dealing with the importation of Covid-19 from badly affected countries as the guidance on self-isolation is not legally based and enforcement is inadequate,” she said.New figures released by the Department of Justice on Wednesday night showed that the number of new arrivals into the country answering follow-up calls to check that they are self-isolating for 14 days at an address continues to decline.The number of passengers coming into Dublin Airport who answered calls two days after their arrival fell to 61 per cent from 68 per cent last week when almost 10,000 additional passengers arriving in the last week of June were included.The figures show a sharp increase in the number of arrivals at the airport. Some 9,355 filled out the Covid-19 passenger locator form between June 21st and 28th compared with a total of 19,866 over the previous three weeks.Filling out the forms is compulsory so State officials can check to see if people are voluntarily self-isolating for 14 days after their arrival into the country.Daily flightsOn Wednesday, the number of daily flights in and out of Dublin Airport doubled from earlier this week as Ryanair restarted 40 per cent of its flight schedule,DAA, the airport’s operator, said about 3,200 passengers used the airport on Tuesday and 4,500 on Monday.“Businesses are now carrying a very high level of unplanned debt accumulated over the last four months which will make survival extremely challenging if not addressed,” Mr Kelly will say in his opening statement.In addition to the lack of revenue from overseas visitors, the capacity restrictions from physical distancing measures and the “challenges to domestic demand created by health and economic concerns will depress revenue levels,” the tourist chief will say in his opening statement.“Tourism was hit first, hit hardest and will take the longest to recover.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"More than 250 people picked up disease while receiving treatment for other conditionsWilliam Eagers also charged with production of a samurai sword while committing the offence in the course of a disputeEvents and exhibits shifting online for next year\u0026rsquos showcase due to Covid-19 pandemicCovid-19 worsens the already precarious scenario for scientists on short-term contractsGovernment says level to which schools will be able to reopen as normal remains uncertainF\u0026aacuteilte Ireland boss to tell D\u0026aacuteil committee virus \u0026lsquodwarfs all previous crises\u0026rsquo for his sectorASTI says students may end up with \u0026lsquoblended\u0026rsquo learning due to physical distancing rulesSeveral TDs from west get posts, but not everyone in the parties has been placatedReport records 168 suicides among people engaged with mental health services last yearFigures show decline in number of self-isolation check-up calls answered by passengersNorth Belfast had searched for him and then grieved for him.

Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293577.1593645260!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"full line up of junior ministers unveiled as taoiseach accused by one td of snub","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJosepha Madigan has been appointed a Minister of State. Photograph: Nick BradshawCork North West Fianna Fáil TD Michael Moynihan’s comments came as 17 junior ministers were appointed on Wednesday.The final Fianna Fáil junior ministerial line up is: Anne Rabbitte (Galway East), Niall Collins (Limerick), Robert Troy (Longford–Westmeath), Mary Butler (Waterford), Jack Chambers (Dublin-West), Charlie McConalogue (Donegal North-East), and Thomas Byrne (Meath East).Dara Calleary, the Government Chief Whip, is a super junior minister who sits at Cabinet.Mr Calleary, a TD for Mayo, has also been given responsibility for sport and the Gaeltacht, following an outcry over his being passed over for a senior ministerial role at the weekend.He said on Monday he was angry and disappointed at not being selected for a senior role in Cabinet.“We had a very difficult conversation. I told him I was disappointed,” he said of his conversation with the Taoiseach.There was also controversy over the lack of a senior minister from the west and the new line up of ministers announced on Wednesday night attempts to address that criticism about regional imbalance.The Fine Gael junior ministers are Colm Brophy (Dublin South-West), Josepha Madigan (Dublin Rathdown), Peter Burke (Longford–Westmeath), Frank Feighan (Sligo–Leitrim), Martin Heydon (Kildare South), Damien English (Meath West) and Patrick O’Donovan (Limerick).Hildegard Naughton (Galway West) is Fine Gael’s super junior minister at the Cabinet table.The Greens’ junior ministers are Joe O’Brien (Dublin Fingal), Ossian Smyth (Dún Laoghaire) and Malcolm Noonan (Carlow-Kilkenny). Senator Pippa Hackett is the party’s super junior at the Cabinet table.Mr Moynihan, who was the Fianna Fail party’s chief whip, said Mr Martin had “insulted me and my community” by not appointing him a junior minister.He said he is “very, very disappointed with being let down”. He said Fianna Fáil held two out of three seats in his constituency.Mr Moynihan said he “worked extremely hard over nine years to rebuild (the) party, took a lot of stick in terms of picking candidates” but got “no thanks”.“He has insulted me and my community,” Mr Moynihan said.“Very, very disappointed with him.”Turned downEarlier Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan turned down an offer of a junior ministerial post.Mr O’Callaghan told The  he was offered a junior position in the Department of Justice, with responsibility for law reform.“I was asked this afternoon by an Taoiseach, Micheál Martin TD, to accept an appointment as minister of state in the government. Having thought carefully about this offer I have decided not to accept,” he said.“The reason I am not accepting is because I believe my energy and abilities will be better used as a backbench Fianna Fáil TD rather than as a junior member of government.“At a time when many of our party’s senior members will be preoccupied with their ministerial duties, I want to devote more time to strengthening our great party by making it a more attractive option for young voters. I also believe Fianna Fáil needs strong voices outside government who can ensure that our party’s identity can be protected during the term of this coalition government.“I wish Micheál and his government every success in the years ahead.”The outgoing Fine Gael Minister for Education Joe McHugh is understood to have also turned down a junior ministerial post.‘Votegate’Mr Chambers has been appointed Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for financial institutions.Mr Collins has been appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education. When the “votegate” scandal erupted in the Dáil last year he lost his portfolio as the party’s spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.The Government appointed 17 junior ministers on Wednesday. The two so-called super juniors who sit at Cabinet as well as the Government chief whip were named on Saturday along with all the senior ministers.The Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green party leaders did not co-ordinate their appointments for the senior ministries resulting in the controversy over the absence of a minister in the West.The new Ministers of State at a glance:Dara Calleary, already appointed to the Department of the Taoiseach as Government Chief Whip, has been assigned additional responsibilities to also be a Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293651.1593638110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bt young scientist technology exhibition to go virtual in 2021","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRebecca Murphy and Abbey Hehir, from St John Bosco Community College, Clare, with their project, Slurry Pit Laser Saves Lives, in January 2020. File photograph: The The BT Young Scientist \u0026amp Technology Exhibition (BTYSTE) is going virtual for 2021 because of continued health and safety concerns around Covid-19.The move means that for the first time in the exhibition’s 56 years it will not be staged physically. Instead it will be transformed “into a spectacular virtual showcase for January 2021”, according to BT Ireland. The measure is an indication of how the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to affect staging of public events extending into next year.Europe’s longest-running science event is scheduled go ahead from January 6th to 9th with students exhibiting virtually and judging taking place across digital platforms. A total of 1,800 projects were entered into the 2020 contest, while 550 finalists from 244 schools showcased their entries in January. Some 50,000 people viewed the exhibition at the RDS, which has hosted it since 1966 – its second year.Members of the public in Ireland, and globally, will be able to visit the exhibition online and enjoy a full calendar of events including special acts, the Primary Science Fair, business events and the exhibits, BT Ireland confirmed. The exhibition is retaining its 200 prizes with €7,500 going to the overall winner and an opportunity to represent Ireland at the EU Contest for Young Scientists in Salamanca, Spain, in September 2021. BT Ireland managing director Shay Walsh said: “With the unprecedented global events of the past few months, we have seen first hand the important role that science and technology is playing in finding solutions to this global pandemic.” He said they had looked at the exhibition with a new lens and wanted to ensure it remained firmly on the educational calendar. Mr Walsh said he wanted to encourage students, teachers and schools to get involved in the virtual event and “be part of something truly special” in January. Exhibition head Mari Cahalane said: “People who have experienced the exhibition over the past 56 years understand it is about much more than a science competition. It’s about imagining an idea and then bringing that idea to life through research and development. We’re going to emphasise that in its truest form by bringing the BTYSTE virtual for 2021.” Information sessions for studentsWhile the exhibition inspires thousands of young people each year to explore “near-endless possibilities in science, technology, engineering and maths”, the exhibition team sought this year to do something new in light of current circumstances, she added. “We will be holding information sessions online for students and teachers over the comings months and our website is the best source – www.btyoungscientist – for up-to-date information for students looking to get started on their entries.” The online entry process remains the same as previous years, but project entry fees have been waived. To enter, an inidual or group must submit a one-page proposal outlining their project idea ahead of the closing date of September 22nd. There are four categories: technology social and behavioural science biological and ecological science and chemical, physical and mathematical science. The Primary Science Fair is open to primary-level students from 3rd to 6th class and will run alongside the main exhibition online."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"At least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293753.1593626392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world look away now these are dark days for the united states","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tParticipants in a Black Lives Matter protest  in  Trafalgar Square, London. ‘The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents.’ Photograph: Niklas HallenEPAAt its midpoint, 2020 is turning out to be one of the darkest years in the peacetime history of the US. It has also affirmed the nation’s global primacy beyond any doubt. Fear not for your columnist’s grip on logical reasoning, at least any more than usual. These contrary claims are reconcilable.The first comes from a mere glance at the facts. The US accounts for a quarter of the world’s recorded deaths from Covid-19. Its people are ignominiously barred from entry to the EU and other allied territories. Unemployment is at its highest rate for a human lifetime. The killing of George Floyd has exposed racial inequities and highlighted once more a homicide rate that marks America out among rich countries.Even if the Depression was more acutely harrowing, there was no pandemic and, from 1933, people had Franklin Roosevelt to lead them, not a thrown, lost-looking Donald Trump. On that point, with the logistical test of a presidential election still ahead, the year has ample room to get worse.Compounding these traumas is intense scrutiny from the rest of the world. And so to the second claim. The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents.For all its heft, China does not draw young Europeans to the streets on behalf of Uighurs or the cause of democracy in Hong Kong. At least not in such awesome numbers. It took the Floyd killing at the hands of police to do that. And, while the US has botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic, other countries with dismal records (namely Britain) escape without the same volume or tenor of foreign coverage.Such exposure was the price America once paid for its overwhelming superiority in economic scale and military potential. It was a tax on world leadership and, as such, eminently affordable. With China’s gains in both gross domestic product and armaments, however, even this consolation no longer applies.The US, then, finds itself in the worst of all possible worlds. Its external power and internal cohesion are manifestly in decline. Its psychic hold on the rest of humanity is not. The result is a level of scrutiny that no other nation, not even the other superpower, has to experience – or, perhaps, could withstand. The tighter the inspection, the more numerous the revealed flaws, and the more compromised is America’s ability to command global deference.ObsessionThe whole process is viciously circular. What is a boon for a Washington correspondent – everyone, everywhere has an opinion on the US – can be a bane for Americans themselves.As the tussle develops, China’s obvious advantages over the US include a four-times-larger population and a one-party system’s ability to plan long-term. But a less discussed one is the world’s lower level of obsession with it, for now. This is more often framed as a liability: a lack of soft power, of cultural magnetism, compared with the land of Netflix and all-conquering pop stars. But the corollary is greater freedom from outside invigilation.A discreet rise is what China is said to have achieved over recent decades. The US is condemned to the exact opposite: to wane in public, like an actor who no longer commands the plum roles but remains hounded by paparazzi. Its crimes and mistakes are still aired like no other nation’s.It was natural that America held the world rapt when that world was unipolar. That it continues to do so in 2020 needs some explaining. One reason is the country’s relative openness to media coverage. Another, reinforcing the first, is the English language: it is easier for the average European (or Australian or Nigerian) to follow US public life than China’s.Yet a third reason, it has to be said, is America’s self-image as a standard bearer for the species. Claim city-on-a-hill status, and cynics will comb the city for blemishes and signs of subsidence, even if they do so with tasteless relish or with great hypocrisy. Trump, a raw nationalist, tends to avoid talk of the US as a moral experiment on behalf of mankind. His successors should retain this if no other feature of his presidency.This week, the UK government named some policies after Roosevelt’s New Deal, a now almost 90-year-old programme of disputed effectiveness undertaken in different circumstances in a different continent. The way the US continues to serve as a reference point is impressive. It is a vestigial mark of its time as a truly unchallenged power. But it comes at the cost of painful exposure.The world is moving on from American hegemony.

I’m not saying he’s losing his touch – at least not on record – but Boris Johnson’s in-house iconoclast, brought in to disrupt, destroy and rebuild the very heart of the sclerotic establishment, has decided the best way to do this is with a (whisper it) corporate awayday. Cringe. There we were thinking he was a pound-shop Elon Musk. Turns out he’s a bona fide David Brent.“All aboard! Everybody been to the loo? Remember you will never work in a place like this again. Fact. It’s brilliant. Fact. And you’ll never have another boss like me, someone who’s basically a chilled-out entertainer.”On the face of it, the notion of a charabanc of weirdos and misfits – sorry, I mean special advisers – heading for Barnard Castle like scouts gone rogue is quite compelling.Cummings will, of course, be sprawled proprietorially across the back seat. Why? Because angry game theorists with a side hustle in technological transformation are the new cool kids, daddio.Or maybe these hand-picked members of the New Cognitive Elite will all be travelling separately, like the Royal family, just in case some absolute madman testing his eyesight starts weaving his wife and child across the County Durham highway?Either way, on arrival there will presumably be plenty of opportunity not to mingle (that’s a key selling-point of the weird and misfitting) before they are turfed, shoeless, into the wilderness, with orders only to return once they have fully actualised their own inexistence, caught and skinned a rabbit with their teeth and finished Big Bad Dom’s extensive reading list.This includes Superforecasting by Philip Tetlock, a hefty 350-pager on how historical patterns can be used to accurately predict the future. Who knew that history repeats itself? Apart from every historian who ever lived and Karl Marx. Groucho, too.There’s also High Output Management, written by Andrew Grove, author of Only the Paranoid Survive, which sounds a lot more useful given that Dom will probably be taking potshots at them all as they run about his father’s forested estate like headless Spads, crying and trying to predict what terrible indignity will befall them next, and from which direction.Cummings’s modus operandi resides in wildly espousing originality for originality’s sake at the expense of logic for everyone’s sake. He also takes impish pleasure in confounding and confusing the grown-ups.This is odd because, in reality, he’s a balding 48-year-old father and could, if he lost the snarl, easily pass for one himself. It is also odd because any fule kno that reading the same books churns out the same narrow mindset.A smarter operator would set a random selection of unique works – say, a medieval vade mecum, a biography of Burke (Kathy, not Edmund), the collected works of AA Milne and that new lockdown cookbook from Nigella. Now that would result in a genuinely innovative brainstorm.But Cummings isn’t really interested in free thinkers any more than David Brent, who famously observed: “Remember that age and treachery will always triumph over youth and ability.”Boris’s right-hand apparatchik claims to be a visionary.

I’m certain most Brits are already against racism, making the moral grandstanding we’ve seen from organisations such as the Premier League over the past few weeks utterly pointless and, as it turns out, rather counter-productive.Quick to jump on the Black Lives Matter bandwagon, the Premier League supported footballers getting involved by taking the knee and wearing BLM slogans on the back of their shirts. Had they taken some time to research the Black Lives Matter movement upfront, considered the people behind the campaign and the message they’re trying to portray, perhaps they wouldn’t have been so hasty.At last, some of the prominent people who leapt to back the movement in this country have woken up to the fact that Black Lives Matter UK is an anti-capitalist, anti-democratic organisation – just as many of us have been warning for weeks. The signs were there in the disturbing manifesto published on their website for all to see.Its abhorrent views were further highlighted this week when the BLM UK team published unmistakably anti-Semitic messages online. On their Twitter account, they posted: “As Israel moves forward with the annexation of the West Bank, and mainstream British politics is gagged of the right to critique Zionism, and Israel’s settler colonial pursuits, we loudly and clearly stand beside our Palestinian comrades. FREE PALESTINE.” A message taken straight out of the Corbynite handbook of anti-Semitic tropes. If it walks like Momentum and talks like Momentum…Who exactly is “gagging” anyone’s “right to critique Zionism”? Not only did BLM UK refuse to recant or apologise for the statement, they doubled down with a timeline full of anti-Israel, anti-Zionist tweets. Zionism is not racism, fascism or colonialism, nor is it about endorsing the policies of every Israeli government. Zionism is the movement for the self-determination of the Jewish people around the world, and their yearning for a safe homeland, against the backdrop of persecution and genocide. Regardless, what does any of this have to do with black lives mattering in the United Kingdom?The former Southampton player and now Sky Sports pundit Matt Le Tissier was one of the first to question the organisation, saying he would “review” whether or not to wear BLM badge on television. Stronger condemnation came from former Wolverhampton Wanderers captain Karl Henry, who tweeted: “I think the majority of the UK have now had enough of that organisation… Black people’s lives matter! The isive #BlackLivesMatter organisation, however, DOES NOT.” Sir Keir Starmer is another who was quick to subjugate himself by taking a knee for Black Lives Matter, only to say later that its desire to defund the police was nonsense. As organisations begin to wake up to the foul, racist and un-British undertones of the BLM movement, I suspect we’ll see many more begin to distance themselves. We all agree racism has no place in British sport. There are some fantastic movements around, including Show Racism the Red Card, or Kick It Out, with whom I did some work when I first moved to London fifteen years ago. These are mature organisations with respectable goals. There was no need for the Premier League to get into bed with BLM.Let’s hope the Premier League and other equally silly organisations learn from this mess. Do your research. Don’t fall foul of social-media peer pressure to back a political campaign, especially one that’s quite openly calling for capitalism to be smashed. Black Lives Matter defiles British values and should be ignored and disregarded as the opportunistic and extremist Marxist organisation it is.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed areas could face local coronavirus lockdowns within","story":"The new PHE figures show Barnsley has the third highest rate per 100,000 population with 54.7 cases, followed by Rochdale (53.6) and Bedford (42). Former Government scientific adviser Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said these places were clearly of concern.  Search for your area in the table below to see the difference between previously published case counts and revisions including Pillar 2 dataAs it is, we\u0027re having to spread our resources over a wide area rather than targeting them effectively.

Such a move should be made in exceptional circumstances, following discussions with parents, and the full curriculum should be restored no later than the summer term.Pupils in their first year of secondary school may need to be re-taught the Year Six syllabus for English and maths, and GCSE pupils may be asked to drop subjects so they can concentrate on getting good grades in English and maths.Pupils should be assessed regularly through quizzes and close scrutiny of their work to make sure they are not falling behind. The guidance stresses that, as an overriding approach, schools should teach a broad and ambitious curriculum which includes a wide range of subjects.Social distancing will not be applied in schools at all times, and pupils will instead be grouped into bubbles to limit the risk of transmission between class or year groups.The bubbles will either be a class or an entire year group who have their lessons, breaks and lunchtime together. In primary school, class bubbles will be the norm, whereas in secondary school bubbles will be expanded to include entire year groups.This approach means that, if a pupil tests positive for coronavirus, it is easier for a school to identify which of their classmates also need to self-isolate.Older children should be encouraged to keep their distance from their peers where they can, but the guidance recognises that this is not possible for younger pupils.Teachers should stay at the front of the class and avoid close face-to-face contact within one metre of pupils.Schools should adapt classrooms to give pupils as much space as possible, such as removing unnecessary furniture.Windows should be kept open where possible, and desks should be set out with pupils sitting side by side, facing the front of the class, rather than sitting face-to-face with their peers.Year groups should be kept apart, meaning that assemblies or any other large gatherings, such as communal prayer, are banned.School choirs and ensembles are also banned, as the guidance warns that there is an additional risk of infection where pupils are singing, chanting, playing wind or brass instruments or shouting. These activities could take place with special controls in place, such as limiting group sizes to 15 pupils and ensuring they stand back-to-back or side-to-side. It should be outdoors where possible, with extended social distancing.Schools should conduct sports lessons outside where possible, and if this is not possible then a large indoor space should be used. Children should do sports lessons within their bubbles, and equipment must be thoroughly cleaned after being used by each year group.Schools should stagger break times and lunchtimes where they can, to make sure that each bubble of students stays apart from other bubbles as much as possible. Outdoor playground equipment should be cleaned more often.School kitchens should be fully open from the start of term, but must comply with the Government\u0027s Covid-19 guidance for food businesses. Dining room surfaces should be cleaned between use by different bubbles. All the normal legal requirements will apply for schools to provide lunch for those who want it, as well as those eligible for free school meals.Schools should stagger the start and end of the day to alleviate congestion and to prevent different year groups or classes from mixing with one another.The school day does not need to be extended to accommodate this, but break times or free periods could be moved around to make it work. The start and end of a school day should not coincide with rush hour, and parents must be told not to congregate at the gate or come on to the premises unless they have an appointment.Schools need to make it clear to pupils and staff that any face masks they wore while travelling to school must be removed on arrival.Schools should update their behaviour policies to include sanctions for breaching the new hygiene or bubble regimes, and the new rules must be clearly explained to pupils and their parents.Teachers are told to prepare for an increase in bad behaviour among children who may have suffered from adversity, trauma and a lack of routine during lockdown.Pupils may struggle to re-engage with learning, and teachers will need to work hard to reintegrate them into school life. Schools can discipline unruly children, but should only expel them as a last resort.The guidance reminds teachers that off-rolling is never acceptable and that parents should not be pressured into home-schooling their child.Pupils should walk or cycle to school where possible and avoid using public transport, particularly at peak times such as rush hour.Schools could set up walking buses, where a teacher accompanies a group of children walking to or from school. Where pupils do need to use public transport to get to school, local councils will be asked to prioritise taking them on buses.Where pupils are using dedicated school transport, they do not need to socially distance from one another, but pupils should remain in their bubbles where they can. If they are mixing with other bubbles, they should wear face masks. Children should use hand sanitiser when getting on and off a school bus, while vehicles should be regularly cleaned.Children and staff should wash their hands immediately when they arrive at school, as well as regularly throughout the day.The mantra of catch it, bin it, kill it should be drilled into all pupils, meaning anyone who coughs or sneezes should use a disposable tissue and then throw it away. Schools need to make sure there are enough tissues and bins in the school for pupils to follow this directive.Frequently-touched surfaces should be cleaned using detergents and bleach, and the whole school premises should be regularly cleaned.Face masks are generally not necessary in schools as they inhibit communication, and personal protective equipment (PPE) is only necessary if a child develops coronavirus symptoms while at school and a teacher is unable to stay two metres away while waiting for them to be picked up by their parents.Teachers have been told to make sure that remote learning is fully integrated into their lesson plans since it may need to be an essential component of children\u0027s learning if there is a local lockdown and a school is closed down.Schools must have contingency plans in place for remote learning by the end of September at the latest. This should include high quality online resources for children and teaching videos, as well as printed worksheets and textbooks for those who do not have computers.Children who are leaning at home must be set meaningful and ambitious work in different subjects every day, and this must be equivalent in standard to what they would have learnt during a normal school day.Remote learning plans should also be in place for any students who are self-isolating, as well as pupils who are shielding.Read more: Home-schooling tips and secrets for parentsAll league tables are suspended for the next academic year. GCSEs and A-levels will take place in summer 2021, but with some adaptations, including those which will free up teaching time.The exam regulator, Ofqual, will publish detailed proposals on this in the coming weeks. Schools will also be expected to put on a full series of GCSE and A-level exams this autumn for pupils wishing to appeal against the predicted grades they are given this summer.  All statutory tests, including the phonics screening check, Year Four times tables tests and Year Six Sats, will take place next academic year as normal.If a school has two or more confirmed cases of coronavirus within two weeks, or an overall rise in sickness or absence where coronavirus is suspected as a cause, this will be seen as a possible outbreak. In such a case, the school must liaise with their local health protection team who will advise on whether further action is needed.The health protection team may recommend that a number of other pupils stay at home and self-isolate as a precaution. This could include an entire year group or even all pupils in the whole school.School closures will not generally be necessary and should not be implemented unless on the advice of health experts. If an outbreak in a school is declared, a mobile testing unit may be sent to the school so that any pupils or staff can be tested. Testing will initially focus on the ill pupil\u0027s class, followed by their year group and, if necessary, the entire school.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"significant number people may have natural immunity coronavirus","story":"Professor Sarah Gilbert, of the vaccine team, said: It\u0027s possible that we are underestimating natural or already acquired immunity to this virus, and we really need to keep an eye on it.A recent study suggested children may be protected from coronavirus because they catch so many colds. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china vows corresponding measures uk enacts hong kong citizenship","story":"China will take countermeasures if Britain presses ahead with a plan to grant millions of Hongkongers a pathway to citizenship in response to a sweeping new security law, Beijing\u0027s embassy in London said on Thursday.If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law and basic norms governing international relations, the embassy said in a statement on its website.We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures, it added, without elaborating.We urge the British side to view objectively and fairly the national security legislation for Hong Kong, respect China\u0027s position and concerns, refrain from interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any way.Hong Kong was under British control until 1997, and three million of its people have British National Overseas status, who will now be allowed to apply for British citizenship after Beijing cracked down on the pro-democracy movement in the city.More to follow More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dog year isnt seven human years scientists find pets might older","story":"A commonly held belief among dog owners is that if they want to know how old their pet is, they simply have to times its age by seven.Then, it can be decided whether man\u0027s best friend is acting up because it is a naughty teenager - or simply due to poor training.However, new research has found that this method is not based on science, and our pooches may be far \u0027older\u0027 than previously believed.As people, and animals, age, the number and placement of methyl groups in the genome change. By mapping these, scientists can tell the age of an organism.The researchers from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine used blood samples from 105 Labrador retrievers to accurately work out how quickly the breed ages. The study, published in Cell Systems, found the comparison is not a 1:7 ratio over time. Especially when dogs are young, they age rapidly compared to humans. A one-year-old dog is similar to a 30-year-old human. A four-year-old dog is similar to a 52-year-old human. Then by seven years old, dog aging slows, and a 12-year-old dog is 70 in human years.This makes sense when you think about it - after all, a nine-month-old dog can have puppies, so we already knew that the 1:7 ratio wasn\u0027t an accurate measure of age, said senior author Dr Trey Ideker, professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine.Scientists say this new comparison between dog ageing and human could be helpful for vets, so they can work out whether illnesses in dogs are age-related. The formula provides a new epigenetic clock, a method for determining the age of a cell, tissue or organism based on a readout of its epigenetics, which are chemical modifications like methylation, which influence which genes are off or on without altering the inherited genetic code.Previous studies have found epigenetic clocks for humans, but these don\u0027t translate to other species and may not even be the same for other humans.One limitation of this clock is they only used blood from Labradors, and different breeds are known to live for different amounts of time.  Dr Ideker plans to test more breeds, but said that since it\u0027s accurate for humans and mice as well as Labrador retrievers, he predicts the clock will apply to all dog breeds.I have a six-year-old dog -- she still runs with me, but I\u0027m now realising that she\u0027s not as \u0027young\u0027 as I thought she was, Dr Ideker added.He said dogs are interesting to study because they live so closely with us, perhaps more than any other animal, so a dog\u0027s environmental and chemical exposures are very similar to humans, and they receive nearly the same levels of health care.The research could be useful for humans, not just their pets. The scientists believe the epigenetic clock could be used to test anti-ageing treatments, to see if they had made any difference to the methylation patterns in the genome and therefore altered the \u0027age\u0027 of human cells.There are a lot of anti-ageing products out there these days - with wildly varying degrees of scientific support, Dr Ideker said,  But how do you know if a product will truly extend your life without waiting 40 years or so? What if you could instead measure your age-associated methylation patterns before, during and after the intervention to see if it\u0027s doing anything?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 2nd july 2020","story":"Police detain a protester after being sprayed with pepper spray during a protest in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong before the annual handover march and against China\u0027s national security law that cracks down on protests in Hong KongPolitics latest news: Heads frustrated as they only find out schools blueprint from Watch: What will hairdressers look like on July 4?Revealed: The new coronavirus guidelines for schools to open in SeptemberAir bridges shelved as holidaymakers cleared for take-off to 75 countriesThursday morning news briefing: Holidays cleared for take-offChina vows \u0026#39corresponding measures\u0026#39 if UK enacts Hong Kong citizenship planShaun Bailey pledges to drop \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39 statue review on first day as London mayorCoronavirus vaccine \u0026#39almost 100pc certain to be found\u0026#39Leicester lockdown map: What areas are included, and what are the rules?A dog year isn\u0026#39t seven human years, scientists find, and pets might be \u0026#39older\u0026#39 than you thinkAustralia considers providing a safe haven for Hong Kong residentsHong Kong protests: Police arrest man at airport after stabbing of officer as clashes over new law spill into second dayHuge drop in air pollution in first month of coronavirus lockdownGovernment coronavirus expert \u0026#39anxious\u0026#39 about pubs reopening on SaturdayDubious voting will allow Vladimir Putin to stay in office until he is 83Man arrested over toppling of Edward Colston statue during Black Lives Matter protestsChildren with Covid-19 may develop neurological symptoms, study findsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thursday morning news briefing holidays cleared take off","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe said spreading out the labs as opposed to centralising testing was easier, logistically, and meant faster results.Alongside the mass testing he said any positive result was communicated to local health authorities immediately, initially by phone, though the system is now automated.“We were the laboratory who picked up the first two cases in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, that’s the state in the northeast,” Hefel said. ”We reported at four o’clock on the results and two hours later it was in the media. In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

But it appears to have either been stripped of its gaseous atmosphere, or never failed to form one.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, researchers can see the core that would normally be found inside such an exoplanet. That allows them to look inside the interior of the world and learn about its composition.The newly discovered planet orbits a star similar to our Sun, and is found about 730 light years away. It is known as TOI 849 b, and conditions there are intense: it is so close to its star that a year takes 18 hours, and the surface temperature is around 1,500C.That places the planet right in the Neptunian Desert, the region near stars where planets the size of Neptune are rarely found.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien life“The planet is strangely close to its star, considering its mass,” said David Armstrong from the University of Warwick, the lead author of the study, in a statement. “In other words, we don’t see planets with this mass at these short orbital periods.”Researchers were able to conclude that it was just a planetary core by conducting detailed measurements, which found that the planet is about 40 times heavier than the Earth, but only 3.4 times as large. That density must mean that it is made up mostly of iron, rock and water, with only small amounts of hydrogen and helium.“The fact that we don’t see those gases lets us know TOI 849 b is an exposed planetary core,” said Dr Armstrong.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It was then further analysed by the HARPS instrument run by the European Southern Observatory, which uses the Doppler effect to measure exoplanets by looking for the wobble in their light that happens as they move nearer and further from us.“One way or another, TOI 849 b either used to be a gas giant or is a ‘failed’ gas giant,” said Dr Armstrong.“It’s a first, telling us that planets like this exist and can be found.“We have the opportunity to look at the core of a planet in a way that we can’t do in our own solar system.“There are still big open questions about the nature of Jupiter’s core, for example, so strange and unusual exoplanets like this give us a window into planet formation that we have no other way to explore.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She immediately offered her apology.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Oh I’m really sorry, that’s my son arriving, really embarrassed, sorry,” she said as she told her to son to wait “one second”.He refused to wait, though, and asked Haynes: “Can I have two biscuits?”Simon Armitage: ‘The events of this year are all I can think about’Ciaran Lavery: ‘I think most musicians are quite bitchy and jealous’Will Smith ‘gave blessing for wife Jada Pinkett Smith to have affair’ Dealing with the situation like a professional, Haynes said: “Yes, you can have two biscuits.” She then told Austin she was “really sorry”.However, instead of leaning into the comic nature of the moment, Austin wrapped up the interview, saying: “We’ll leave Deborah Haynes there, in full flow with some family duties.”This has led to criticism on social media with many feeling the the decision to halt Haynes’s interview failed to “normalise childcare” in the time of lockdown.“I think this was disappointingly handled by @SkyNews,” one person wrote on Twitter.He believes “they should have stayed with the reporter” like they did during a similar instance on BBC News, which also occurred yesterday evening (1 July) also.British boxer Ashley Theophane wrote: “Poor showing from @SkyNews. No need to cut her off.”Another said the situation was “badly handled” by Austin, with one tweeter writing: “Incredibly graceless response compared to the BBC.”A mother watching said that if she was Haynes, she would have much experienced ”the @BBCNews approach”.She said: “Parenting and work don’t exist separately.”Haynes has been working for Sky News since 2018.Earlier on BBC News, Dr Clare Wenham, a global health policy expert from the London School of Economics, had been speaking to the broadcaster about local coronavirus lockdowns, when her young daughter interrupted the interview.As she decided where a piece of art depicting a unicorn should be displayed on a shelf behind her mother, presenter Christian Fraser asked Wenham what her child’s name was, and even offered an opinion on where the artwork should go.The best in film, music, TV \u0026 radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out. No one is being paid, we’re just working for a great cause. It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community. The people have been really welcoming of me into their community.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The project manager from Colindale felt “guilty” about sitting at home while supported by taxpayer money through the furlough scheme. “I wanted to help others,” he said. He and his girlfriend signed up to work one day a week at OneStonegrove.He said: “We have spoken about doing this when it’s all over. It’s great to help out.”Readers have just three more days to bid for a piece of Sir Peter’s Blake’s pop artwork, Our Fans, to raise money for Help The Hungry. The auction of the giant mural – which echoes Sir Peter’s design of The Beatles’ Sgt Pepper album and was draped over the London Mandarin Oriental hotel during its 2017 renovation – closes at midnight on Friday.

And it’s a lovely unicorn.”After the newsreader’s input, Scarlett then begins to ask Dr Wenham: “What’s his name? What’s his name mummy?”Minister’s BBC interview interrupted three times by other callsVirtual Supreme Court hearing is interrupted by flushing toilet Arnold Schwarzenegger interview interrupted by donkey and tiny horseBBC News viewers in stitches as Robert Kelly returns with childrenThe mother gently shushes her daughter as Fraser says “do stop me if you need to crack on,” before telling the girl: “My name is Christian.”“Christian,” Scarlett repeats, before adding: “I’m just deciding where it can go. Where mummy wants it to go. Mummy where do you want it to go?”Dr Wenham agrees the artwork would look great on the shelf and apologises to the interviewer as they both share a laugh.The footage was reminiscent of a similar BBC interview in 2017, in which an interview about South Korean politics was crashed by two youngsters.A live interview with an MSNBC correspondent was similarly interrupted by her daughter in 2019.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There would be no objection, they say, to servicemen and women taking the knee or going on marches for human rights when they are wearing civilian clothing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere is, however, no central directive from the Ministry of Defence on taking the knee, and service personnel in uniform have regularly taken part in LGBT+ Pride marches without censure.The issue under discussion, it is believed, is whether the gesture would be seen to be tied to an overtly political movement. Defence officials acknowledge, however, that taking the knee has a history with  the US civil rights movement,  and any decision on it will take this into account.There is an apparent element of confusion in the government about taking the knee. Foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said recently that the gesture came from TV series Game of Thrones, triggering social media postings of photographs of Martin Luther King carrying out the action during the struggle against segregation in the American South.

The service’s union, the Police Federation, said this showed “we are all human beings”.A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “We do not tolerate racism and promote ersity and equality. The recent protests have reminded us that we all have a role to play shaping a better future.” Officials point out that the military has consistently won awards over the years for being among the best employers for racially erse personnel in the country.Dominic Raab says taking the knee has ‘feudal connotation’Education minister says he would take the knee in support of BLMRaab ridiculed for claiming taking a knee comes from Game of ThronesSenior officers say they accept much more needs to be done to eradicate racism in the armed forces. In a letter to members of the Army, Royal Navy and the RAF, General Sir Nick Carter said recent protests “have brought the issues of racism and discrimination sharply into focus. We owe it to our black, Asian and minority ethnic servicemen and women, who will be feeling concerned at the moment, to try to look at this from their perspective, to listen and to continue to make change happen”.The chief of defence staff said that although the armed forces is a “rich mix of faiths, colour, gender and creeds reflected in British society”, it must be ensured that people are judged on their abilities and “not for what they look like or where they come from”.Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, recently stressed that the military must “reset” its “woeful” record on discrimination against black and minority ethnic personnel. In an interview with The House magazine he said it had historically “not done well enough” in either recruiting or welcoming people from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (Bame) background.Figures published by the Service Complaints Ombudsman for the Armed Forces show that Bame personnel are more likely to complain about bullying, harassment and discrimination than their white counterparts. While Bame staff make up just 7 per cent of overall armed forces personnel, they account for a disproportionate 13 per cent of those lodging complaints about discrimination.Ministry of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Cities and towns including Bradford, Barnsley and Oldham as well as parts of London are being monitored closely amid fears that Leicester-style flare-ups of coronavirus could emerge elsewhere in the country.But officials believe that the outbreak on Leicester remains on a different scale from other sites where mini-spikes have emerged in recent weeks, and no further city-wide lockdowns are expected within the coming days, official sources told The Independent.All eyes are on the virus’s response to the ‘super Saturday’ relaxation of lockdown restrictions on 4 July, when pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be among thousands of businesses reopening after more than 100 days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrime minister Boris Johnson has said he will not hesitate to reimpose localised controls should testing reveal new pockets of infection following the weekend.The decision to exempt Leicester from Saturday’s rollback of lockdown was taken after infection rates reached 135 per 100,000 population in the East Midlands city, with signs that the virus had broken out of inidual workplaces and institutions and was spreading within households.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolThe city’s infection rate remains more than three times the next biggest hotspot, Bradford, at around 40 per 100,000.

But the source said that as things stand no active preparations are understood to be being made for Leicester-style city-wide lockdowns in the coming days.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Oiled by the Kremlin’s election machine, the result of Vladimir Putin’s vote on constitutional reform – one that would allow him to rule until 2036 – was never in doubt.But the decision by Russia’s election commission to publish “preliminary” live results five hours before polling closed was a novelty that shocked even the most cynical of observers.The initial projection of 73 per cent in favour of amendments was broadly in line with exit polls published by state pollsters FOM and VTsIOM. They projected 70 per cent and 76 per cent respectively, also before the end of polling. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOpposition groups painted an altogether different picture. At 5.30pm local time (3.30pm GMT), their own exit polls projected a near tie in Moscow (47.76 per cent for, 52.24 against) and a heavy defeat for the president in his home city of St Petersburg (38.2 percent for, 61.8 per cent against).The constitutional plebiscite was an unusual electoral exercise for Russia, with polling stretched over seven days and in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said the unprecedented measure was necessary to ensure safe voting.Why is Putin changing the constitution?For critics, it was a trick to boost turnout from a population tired of their longtime leader.The vote is taking place in a tricky period for Mr Putin, who has lost much of his glow after a torrid few months of largely absent Covid-19 crisis management. According to Levada Centre, Russia’s most independent pollster, Mr Putin is still trusted by 59 per cent of Russians, but that figure is down 30 per cent from a post-Crimea high of three years ago.In open polling, ie when Russians are asked to name the politicians they most trust themselves, support drops to 29 per cent. The figure is lowest among young voters, with less than one in 10 expressing affiliation.This week’s ballot asked for a “yes” or “no” answer to 206 amendments in entirety, with the proposal to reset term limits buried deep amongst them. It was “technically impossible” to ask voters to go through the changes one by one, authorities claimed.Invariably, official campaign literature focused on the other 205 amendments, targeting populist pressure points from marriage as a heterosexual union, to indexation guarantees for pensions and other social benefits. In his address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr Putin made no mention of the all-important clause on term limits.The poll has also been marred by allegations of vote-rigging, but given the prevalence of home and electronic voting, this is difficult to verify.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Deputy elections chief Nikolai Bulayev talked about a “breakthrough” in the low number of complaints received.Mr Putin said that election manipulation methods such as forced voting, “rounding errors” in counting and inflating turnout were “inadmissible”. But there was evidence of all methods being rolled out – and more.On Thursday, the first day of voting, Pavel Lobkov, a journalist for the independent Dozhd television channel, reported he had managed to vote twice. He was later questioned by police for his efforts, with prosecutors now threatening criminal charges for “election fraud”.‘Like two guys in a steam bath’: Source describes Trump-Putin callsSupport for Putin wanes in his former Russian strongholdPutin says coronavirus is retreating and condemns anyone who disagreesPutin looms over Russia’s latest vote – but it’s not all about himA week earlier, a colleague from the same channel was taken in for questioning after he uncovered a corrupt scheme to register elderly voters for electronic voting. Some of the most egregious manipulations during the week were recorded in the northern capital of St Petersburg.There, election officials were recorded by local journalists stuffing papers into the ballot box. At another polling station, an election observer claimed officials refused to give him access to voting numbers.When journalist David Frenkel followed up on these claims a day later, he was seriously assaulted by a police officer and another unidentified man. He ended up in hospital with a broken shoulder bone.The election monitoring group Golos reported a total of 1,500 separate infringements during the seven-day vote. Ella Pamfilova, Mr Bulayev’s boss at the election commission, dismissed the claims, and Golos as a “toxic and degraded” organisation.Ilya Azar, the journalist who has become an unexpected alternative protest figurehead, has announced a protest for 6pm local time (4pm BST) in Pushkin Square. He was responding to a “coup d’etat”, he said in a Facebook post. But in an open admission of the impossibility of protesting in Russia, he said he would not be openly encouraging others to join him.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Speaking with Channel  News, he said #both sides are to blame#a no-deal Brexit went ahead.The prospect #would be disadvantageous to both sides# but it would #hit Britain much harder# the MP said.However, he added: #We still can do something # we are living in a threatening, chaotic world and we have to stay together because unity means strength.#Britain is alone # we are #.Angela Merkel says Britain will have to #live with the consequences# of Boris Johnsons decision to loosen economic ties with the EU in the event of a no-deal exit.The PM scrapped the idea of maintaining close economic ties with the EU after the Brexit transition period ends on December .

That is for Britain to define – and we, the EU, will respond appropriately.#With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves.#It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.#Lord Heseltine, the architect of government plans for urban renewal in the s, said he believed Brexit added uncertainty and unpredictability to the issues created by the coronavirus pandemic. “Brexit and COVID add-up to one great question mark,# he said. #Its no use just making speeches that just talk about bouncing this way or that. The people who are going to be making the decisions are hard-headed, responsible iniduals. #Theyre not going to listen to political speeches before they make political decisions. #They will look at the hard facts as they see them on the ground.

including the House of Commons #Boris Johnsons Government continues to block a second Scottish independence referendum, one of the partys most senior MPs has suggested.Pete Wishart, an SNP MP for almost two decades, said the party could consider #withdrawing from the apparatus of the UK state#Westminster continues to reject calls for a fresh vote on the issue.This could be #escalated# to the extent of impacting on the SNPs #participation in institutions of the UK Parliament#, he added.Mr Wishart arguedWestminster continues to refuse calls for a referendum, the Scottish Government could try to seek the support of the European Union and the international community for such a ballot.The UK has insisted that it wants to #work constructively# with the EU.The Prime Ministers official spokesman said: #We believe that there is a free trade agreement to be reached but we have also been very clear that we will be prepared for either eventuality at the end of the year, whether that be a free trade agreement or having a trading relationship based on the same terms that Australia currently has.#Australia does not yet have a formal trade deal with the EU.Image: AFPDowning Street has stressed the UK will be prepared to trade with the European Union without a formal agreement as German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Brussels to step up preparations for a no-deal scenario.Mrs Merkel suggested progress so far had been #very limited# and the EU must be ready for the possibility that #a deal doesnt materialise#.Germany has assumed the rotating EU Council presidency for the next six months, giving the chancellor an influential role in the final phase of the Brexit process.Mrs Merkel told the German parliament that although talks between the UK and EU were intensying, the EU #must be prepared# for the possibility that a deal will not be reached.Tory MPs have blocked a bid to prevent prime ministers being nominated without the consent of Parliament.Bringing forward such proposals, SNP Cabinet Office spokesman Pete Wishart said any prime minister should demonstrate that they have the confidence of the Commons.The Prime Ministerand CabinetBill was brought forward with Theresa May and Boris Johnson having both previously assumed office without a general election.Referencing the period of ill-health suffered by Boris Johnson earlier this year, Mr Wishart argued: #All of us are right relieved to see the Prime Minister back in such rude health, press-upping his way to his disastrous Brexit.#And looking at this epitome of a butchers dog, its hard to believe that it was touch and go for him only a few short weeks ago and thank goodness that the Prime Minister pulled through.#But what we found with the Prime Ministers incapacitation was the equivalent of government by headless chicken.#Without the Prime Ministers customary decisiveness and note for detail, we had no real idea who was running the country.#One of the big sticking points in this round of discussions between the UK and the EU has been over equivalence for financial services.The EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier says the UK hasnt completed necessary assessments by todays deadline.It comes as the UK attempts to determine the Citys access to EU markets after Brexit.But EU officials said the UK has so far only answered four of  questionnaires sent by Brussels seeking more information on British regulation of the financial services industry.However, today, Boris Johnsons official spokesman says the UK has completed the assessments #

by restricting the flow of vehicles.One of the big Brexit stories this week is that British businesses exporting to the EU will have to wait for permission from HMRC before moving their goods.Its part of new plans to stave off chaos at ports.Plans drawn up by officials and reported by Bloomberg say lorries will only be allowed to begin their journey to Doverthey have a valid reference from the new # and so far, untested # Goods Vehicle Movement Service.The system, which is still under development six months from the end of the Brexit transition period, will bar trucks without prior clearance from heading for the channel.Michel Barnier slammed Britains #unacceptable# demands on financial services in a speech to bankers.Addressing a think tank he fumed: #The UK is trying to keep as many single market benefits as it can. #It would like to make it easy to continue to run EU businesses from London, with minimal operations and staff on the continent.#He added a decision on #equivalence# so British banks can carry on trading with the continent has been delayed by the UK failing topaperwork.But British officials blamed Brussels for sending over more than a thousand pages of questions, many of which are irrelevant. Image: ReutersGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the EU must prepare for a possible failure of talks with Britain over a new its new trading relationship.She said the talks will be sped up to achieve an agreement in autumn so it could be ratied by the end of the years.She told the lower house of parliament that the EU #must and should prepare for a situation in which an agreement does not happen#.Scottish ministers #need to wake up to the fact that we have left the EU#, the Scotland Secretary told MPs.Alister Jack said: #I know the Scottish Government dont like the outcomes of referendums when they dont go their way, but this is another one were delivering on.#SNP MP Pete Wishart asked: #An opinion poll recently found that  per cent of the Scottish people back a Brexit extension on top of an overwhelming majority who opposed a Brexit disaster in its entirety.#And the Secretary of States probably seen an opinion poll that finds  per cent of the Scottish people now want an independent Scotland. #What does the Secretary of State believe links these opinion polls and what does it tell him about where our countrys headed #Mr Jack replied: #I think the whole House would like to congratulate him on giving up his own independence getting engaged last weekend. #The answer is that we had a general election, we had a resounding majority across the UK for a manesto that said we would leave, we would honour the result of the referendum. #We are going to honour that result, were going to take back control of our laws, our borders, our money and were going to leave the hated Common Fisheries Policy # heres the independent bit forwere going to become an independent coastal state.#Boris Johnson has urged caution as the lockdown eases and Brits get back to work.“What were trying to do now involves striking a balance,” he says.“It is very, very important as we open up the economy that we do not go too far and risk a second spike and further outbreaks.“People can see whats happening with Leicester.“We need to make sure were doing this in a prudent way.”Image: ReutersMajor companies including Easyjet and Airbus are among those to announce thousands of redundancies this week alone.This has of course been discussed extensively during PMQs.Labour leader Sir Keir, who asked about Boris Johnsons big speech on the economy yesterday, said: “Next weeks financial statement could be the last chance to save millions of jobs.“Will the Prime Minister start now by extending the furlough scheme for those parts of the economy which are still most at risk ”Mr Johnson says the best thing to do is to get people back in work and make sure the virus is “defeated and under control”.Answering another question about redundancies in the arts sector, he said: “Keep supporting your workers with the furloughing scheme – its much, much better now to wait for times to get better, rather than laying people off.”Image: AFPMr Johnson says “the best single thing we can do is get our economy back to health by getting our people back into work”.He says he needs the opposition to “emphatically support ending the lockdown and emphatically support kids being back into school rather than being bossed around by the unions.”He says of Labour: “Were the builders, theyre the blockers – were the doers, theyre the ditherers.”Sir Keir refers to Mr Johnsons big speech on the UK economy, delivered yesterday from Dudley.The Labour leader picks out one line from that speech – “We know that the jobs many people had in January are not coming back” – and asksits the equivalent of something the PM said at the beginning of the crisis – “I must level with you. Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.”“We know what happened next,# he says.“Thats why there needs to be a laser-like focus on protecting jobs.”Mr Johnson says Sir Keir should pay tribute to the Government for protecting million jobs with the furlough scheme and says he wont put a figure on the jobs that could be lost.“Thats why were proceeding with the New Deal, the fair deal for British people,” he argues.“We are going to build, build, build and provide jobs, jobs, jobs.”Boris Johnson is facing off against Sir Keir Starmer for PMQs this afternoon.Sir Keir says the local authorities in Leicester, where the lockdown has been extended, had just half of the information they needed – and didnt even know the real figure of people affected until last week.“The local authority thought there were  positive tests in the last fortnight, when the real figure was ,” he says, adding that theres been a “lost week when the virus was spreading”.Mr Johnson hits back – he says the Government shares its data with all local authorities across the country.However, in defending the whack-a-mole strategy, he does acknowledge there were issues in Leicester.“There were particular problems in implementing the advice and getting people to understand what was necessary to do,” Mr Johnson says.Following on from that last blog post, we thought wed revisit a story from April about the UKs drive to get enough PPE.At that time, Brussels insisted the British Government was given “ample opportunity” to join an EU scheme to bulk buy medical equipment.Officials said officials from the UK apparently missed a series of key meetings on it.And they said the plan to pool procurement of key kit including ventilators and PPE had been a “recurring topic” at virtual meetings British officials attended.Heres that story.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-old told StokeSentinel: “Theres a big problem with rats, some people have even had them in their yard.“Its the fly-tipping that attracts the vermin. You get morons who dont give a damn who just sling their rubbish into an alley and then foxes rip the bags open. Its not what you want.”Mike Flynn, from Alpha Pest Control, said he believes rats have adapted their behaviour to survive as they scrabble for food while restaurants remain shut.He said: “There has definitely been a change in behaviour with the rats over lockdown.“Previously people would throw their takeaway cartons on the road or in car parks but now people are at home more.“The rats are getting more brazen and desperate so are heading into people’s houses.“There’s also been a rise in cannibalistic rats. I had caught one in a trap the other day and when we went back to it was just the bare bones. Another rat had feasted on it.”He added: “They will usually come in through the bathroom or kitchen.“They are often seen in toilets.

Using your skill and ingenuity, you have to predict which town or city will be the next to be put on special measures .⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesTowns and cities where people haven’t been behaving themselves.Right now, it’s Leicester in the sin bin. They are a very community-minded bunch and couldn’t resist going out to meet each other. So there’s a Covid spike.Experts reckon the next place to cop it will be Doncaster. They’re a friendly bunch there, too. But I reckon there’s a decent outside chance it will be Bournemouth or Brighton. Or maybe Cardf is worth a flutter.The people of Leicester are confused, as well they might be. They don’t know what they’re allowed to do any more. I don’t blame them.But it will be as nothing to the confusion across the country which comes as a result of Super Saturday.July  is the day the Government has said we can shake off our chains and go out and get wrecked. Or something.Have you got any plans for the weekend  Going to a rave  Or just down the pub to breathe over as many people as you possibly can. Here’s my big worry. That Super Saturday will be followed, five days later, by Terrible Thursday.Five days is the average time it takes for the Covid virus to make itself known to the person it has taken up home in. That slightly ticklish cough. Bit of a temperature. Uh-oh.Restaurants, pubs, campsites and children’s playgrounds will all be open for business from Saturday. Oh, and hairdressers. Remember them Obviously, it is right that the UK must emerge from what the Prime Minister called its long hibernation. But I think these things need to be done gradually, rather than all at once.Frankly, I would have started with our schools. Teachers have proved themselves to be just about the only people in the country who can’t work from home. Most kids have enjoyed painfully few virtual lessons, and reopening schools first would have shown where our priorities lie.But it’s not a good idea, in my book, to release the bats all in one go. Many people will have taken from Boris’s announcement last week that, after July , lockdown is effectively over.And some of the Government’s guidelines make it easy to be confused.  The two-metre social-distancing rule has been relaxed to something called “one metre-plus”. I haven’t a clue what dference that makes.And the whole thing is very dficult to monitor. The police say they don’t know how they will deal with it.The virus has been dying out because, by and large, we have been abiding by lockdown. The summer sun has helped, too. The best thing we can do to keep that curve plummeting is to do much as we have been doing so far.The last thing we need this summer is a sudden second spike.If you use that phrase you’re supposedly signalling you’re vulnerable. And need attention. But what about the ones who really did have pasta and liked it  And aren’t at all messed up but just want to share their evening meal experiences in a very real sense  They are strange creatures, the young.THE country is on course for a wonderful, “V-shaped economic recovery”, according to a bloke at the Bank of England.I don’t know what that means. A month or so back, the Bank of England was saying the economy was in ruins for ever, mass unemployment, bankruptcies – giant mutant crabs marching across the country eating our children. Or something.Never believe an economist. You’d be better off talking to Mystic Meg.THE latest historical figure to be attacked by people with no sense of history is Charles Dickens.A former Green Party councillor, Ian Driver, sprayed graffiti on a museum to the author, with the inevitable word “racist”.I supposewe were to ban Dickens, it would bring cheer to millions of schoolkids.Great Expectations can be a bit of a grind to get through when you are young.But this tearing down of history has to stop.Was Dickens racist  Yup. He lived in Victorian Britain. Almost everybody had views which wouldn’t go down very well today.But he was also a brilliant writer and a philanthropist.We are all better than our worst acts.The Chinese authorities are reportedly sterilising these people now – taking a leaf out of Hitler’s book. Yet this outrage raises barely a flicker of publicity. Even other Muslim countries don’t complain too much. That’s because they don’t want to upset the third worst country in the world . And what does the United Nations say  Nothing. Just like it says nothing about China’s occupation of Tibet, or its bullying of democracy campaigners in Hong Kong.A GOOD plan from the Prime Minister. Boris wants to turn the deserted shops in our high streets into homes for people.If he did that, he’d cure half of our housing problem very quickly. Without paving over the entire country for new estates.Many of our high streets are decaying. People now go to out-of-town shopping centres for an afternoon of misery with the missus.But here’s another idea for BoJo. Offices.Lockdown proved we don’t need offices like we used to. They were invented because we needed places to shuffle paper around. But we don’t use paper any more. And during lockdown people worked perfectly well from home.Imagine how many homes we could create by changing offices into flats.And how much rent businesses would save.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The McKenzie family had spent  months building up business at the boutique hotel, which offers a luxurious “home from home” atmosphere, so they were shattered. But within days Laura, who runs the hotel with husband Shane and two of their children Callum,  and -year-old Anna, was inspired to help out staff at nearby Glasgow Royal Infirmary. First, they block booked rooms for hospital staff at a reduced rate then with the help of a donation from Celtic FC Foundation, set to work making meals for them. “I made a few phone calls and straightaway we had the team we needed to start producing the meals. It was probably ten days from thinking: ‘This is horric, this is the end’ to thinking ‘We can do something good and support the local hospital here.’” Laura knows the pressure that NHS staff are under because her daughter, Emily, , is a junior doctor in Dundee, so she was desperate to help. With the hotel’s staff all on furlough, Laura assembled a team of volunteer chefs from the city. The Red Onion’s patron chef John Quigley was one of the first to volunteer and Laura worked with the head nurse at the Infirmary to set up the menu.  “We decided we were going to do  meals a day,” she says. “We did  veggie options and  meat options and bought little takeaway tubs and labelled them all up with little stickers that said: ‘With love from Cathedral House’. And every night at quarter to seven the driver from the hospital would come and take the big boxes of food away. He said there was always such a buzz. People were like: ‘Oh, the food’s coming! What have we got today ’” The hotel has now delivered more than , dishes such as jambalaya, bangers and mash and Thai curry. “It was a simple menu, all cooked fresh with lots of veggies and the sort of dishes you’d cook for yourself when you get home from work,” says Laura. Doctors staying at the hotel were delighted because Laura would text them to seethey wanted a dinner putting aside – and they could pop down to the kitchen to collect it. Laura’s home-from-home hospitality was a real comfort to her guests."},{"url":null,"title":"kids think dads better drivers","story":"NewsKids think dads are better drivers than mums but are also angrier and speed moreA survey of six to -year-old asked about the preferences of kids when it comes to sitting in the car, with many suggesting their male parents are better drivers than their female onesShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUL NewsApparently most kids think their dads are angrier drivers\", url\"News, views and top stories .

A study of , six to -year-olds, whose parents both drive, found  per cent named dad as the aposbestapos behind the wheel, with only  per cent opting for mum. Unfortunately for women,  per cent of children also said their mum is most likely to bump the vehicle on a kerb or another car, compared to just a sixth who believe their dad would do this. Mums play the best music though, according to  per cent of children, while only  per cent prefer dadaposs tunes. But  per cent of youngsters admitted to preferring to listen to their own playlists in the car to avoid hearing their parentsapos choice. Reasons for choosing dad as the best driver include the fact he drives for his job, has a van and is the designated holiday driver for the family. But almost two thirds claim their dad drives the fastest - and  per cent think he experiences the most road rage. Despite this,  per cent of youngsters prefer being in the car with their mum, naming her as the parent most likely to join in with car games, such as I Spy, while on a journey. Tfany Wilcox, from MG, which commissioned the research to celebrate the family friendly model range, said: The results paint an interesting picture of family car journeys and how kids see their parents.  Everyone remembers family road trips from when they were younger, the discussions which are had, games that are played and music choices. Itaposs amusing to have an insight into childrenaposs views of their parentsapos driving habits and clearly the results show dad wins when it comes to driving but mum is more fun to be with in the car. Families donapost have to compromise on practicality and style with our family model range and the built-in technology will help keep the kids entertained on both long and short journeys. The research also found dads win at all driving techniques, including being best at both reverse and parallel parking, hill starts and three-point turns. Children also think their dad is more successful than mum at switching lanes on a motorway and parking in tight spaces. And two thirds said their old man is better at changing a tyre compared to just eight per cent who favoured their mother. It also emerged men are more likely to take the driving seat for family car journeys, according to  per cent of the youngsters polled. But this may be because half of the respondents said their mum is more susceptible to getting lost and having to ask for directions.  Dads were found to be most strict when driving, with the top in-car rules including no arguing , no wrappers or rubbish to be left in the vehicleand no shoes on the seats . On the other hand, mums were typically found to be more talkative while in the driving seat. The study, carried out via OnePoll, also revealed  per cent of kids prefer being in dadaposs car with half of them stating this is because itaposs bigger, while  per cent put it down to the fact it has more technology, such as Apple Car Play. A quarter favour their mumaposs vehicle due to it being a nicer colour , having comfier seatsand because the roof comes off . Tfany Wilcox, from MG, added: Itaposs interesting to see how family dynamics play out while on the road, especially through the eyes of children. Our range of family SUVs aim to make journeys with the kids easier, thanks to the top tech available in each model.

While the positive effects of the shutdown on air quality was not felt evenly across the country, urban environments saw drops in the levels of nitrogen oxides of between % to % on average. There is signicant evidence these gasses exacerbate and may even cause asthma over time, and have been linked to heart disease, diabetes and may have an impact on birth outcomes. Nitrogen dioxide also dropped by an average % to % in urban centres, with the greatest falls recorded at roadsides.

German prosecutors suspect paedophile Christian Brueckner, now , abducted the three-year-old British girl from her familyaposs holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Portugal, and murdered a short time later. New details about a phone call - involving a mobile number allegedly used by Brueckner and an unknown person - are set to be revealed on a German TV crime programme. Rudi Cerne, the host of Aktenzeichen XY… Ungelöst , told Focus: The call came from the same place where the little girl was last seen alive. I get the impression something important is happening now. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters previously said a phone allegedly used by Brueckner pinged on a mast at the Ocean Club apartment complex shortly before Madeleine disappeared. Christian Hoppe, an investigator with Germanyaposs Federal Criminal Police Office , is set to discuss new details about the McCann case when he appears on Mr Cerneaposs programme on Wednesday night. Last month, Mr Hoppe broke the news that police had identied a German man as the new chief suspect in Maddieaposs disappearance on the night of May , . German prosecutors say they have evidence Madeleine is dead and they are investigating Brueckner for murder, but they do not have enough evidence to charge their suspect as no body has been found.  Brueckner, who is in jail for drug trafficking and raping a -year-old American woman in Praia da Luz about  months before Madeleine vanished, has claimed through his lawyer he had no involvement in the McCann case. Mr Cerne gave a preview of what will be revealed on Wednesday nightaposs programme. He told Focus: The only thing I can say at the moment is that this also includes the telephone number of the Portuguese prepaid card that was called from the German suspectaposs cellphone. Not even an hour before Maddie disappeared. The call also came from the same place where the little girl was last seen alive, in Praia da Luz in the Algarve. Mr Cerne said he is very excited about what Mr Hoppe will reveal on the programme, which airs on the German TV station ZDF, after last monthaposs show generated hundreds of phone calls to investigators in Germany, the UK and Portugal. He added: I get the impression something important is happening now. He said detectivesapos appeal for help on Wednesday night will focus on the phone call and the mobile numbers that were involved. Mr Cerne said: Iaposm not an investigator. But I know that they work through every single clue, whatever it is. If you keep getting similar information over and over again, then you prick your ears up. That is why they are now looking for public help again.  Clearly this telephone number, which was called from the suspectaposs mobile phone shortly before Maddieaposs disappearance, has a very large role in the investigation. I would imagine the BKA would need all the information about who owned this prepaid number, who called it, who was called from it. Every little clue, however small, counts - and is processed. Police said previously that a phone linked to the suspect received a call that lasted  minutes between .pm and .pm, close to the Ocean Club about an hour before Madeleine disappeared.  The unknown caller, who is not thought to have been in the Praia da Luz area, is not being treated as a suspect, but is said to be a key witness. Earlier in the investigation, police took the unusual step of releasing two phone numbers from the call. The first phone number,  , is believed to have been used by the suspect. The number for the other Portuguese mobile was  . In a recent interview with  Minutes, Mr Wolters said a phone linked to Brueckner was used in the immediate area of the McCannsapos holiday flat the night she disappeared. Mr Wolters said the phone was connecting in the mast belonging to Ocean Club. Madeleine was last seen alive at the Ocean Club complex where her family, from Rothley, Leicestershire, was staying days before her fourth birthday. Her parents, Kate and Gerry, left her and her -month-old twin siblings, Sean and Amelie, sleeping alone while they had dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby.

The Duchess of Sussex also for the first time named five friends who criticized her dad, Thomas, after the pair had a spectacular falling out in the lead up to her May  nuptials. In a series of statements made in legal papers submitted to the High Court, the -year-old claimed her wedding raised £billion in tourist revenue. The papers say this “far outweighed” the contribution of taxpayersapos money towards crowd security. This figure has been previously doubted by consulting firm Brand Finance, MailOnline reports, with a figure of £million closer to the mark. Meghan also says she was prevented from defending herself against reports concerning the acrimonious relationship with her father, which left her friends “rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant” . The former actress is suing Associated Newspapers Limitedowner of The Mail On Sunday newspaper over five articles, which included reproduced parts of a handwritten note she had sent to her father in August . Meghan claims her dad’s decision to make the letter public breached her privacy,and data protection rights. In a major development this evening it emerged in confidential papers that Meghan not only identied her pals who spoke anonymously to People magazine, but insisted she didn’t know they were doing so.  Meghan said she did not know about the interview having been given, and only found out about it, and any reference to the Letter, after the People magazine article was published. The friends have never been named, with the magazine only referring to them as “Meghanaposs inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante”. They are detailed as friends A, B, C, D and E in redacted documents but named in confidential papers submitted to the court. Meghan’s lawyers insist the Duchess “discussed with Friend A that she was writing a letter to her father at the time of penning itapos, which was seven months before the article was published in People in February .Legal experts predict the associates could now be called to testy in court during a sensational trial - dubbed “Markle versus Markle” expected at the end of the year or early . The documents state: As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself. At the beginning of May Associated Newspapers asked Mr Justice Warby to strike out the following allegations in Meghanaposs case: - That the defendant acted dishonestly and in bad faith. - That the defendant deliberately dug up or stirred up conflict between the claimant and her father. - That the claimant was distressed by the defendant’s “obvious agenda of publishing intrusive or offensive stories about [her] intended to portray her in a  and damaging light”.

But behind the white painted mask of Marcel Marceau was a story he never wanted to tell. Unknown to his legions of fans, he saved the lives of more than  Jewish children from the Holocaust, risking his le to take them across the Alps from France into Switzerland. Marcel’s remarkable story is told at last in Resistance, a new film in which he is played by Social Network star Jesse Eisenberg. Director Jonathan Jakubowicz knew Marcel as the performer who changed modern theatre and even inspired Michael Jackson’s moonwalk. But he admits he knew nothing about Marcel’s most incredible achievement until he began researching his le before writing the script. Jonathan says: “I had no idea that he was Jewish or that he saved children in the war, that he found his art through the very act of saving children. I felt likethat is the story behind him it needed to be told. “I was going to the Cannes Film Festival so I felt like since I’m going to France maybe I can meet some of the people involved in that story.” Marcel died in France in , aged , but Jonathan tracked down his cousin Georges Loinger, who headed the Jewish Boy Scouts of France and Jewish Resistance during the war.  Jonathan says: “He was at the centre of this whole network that ended up saving , children. He was the man who recruited Marcel to the Resistance.” Born Marcel Mangel, he and his father, a kosher butcher, mother and younger brother lived in Strasbourg, France, on the border with Germany. But while they could see the growing Nazi threat from across the border, Marcel at first ignored the rumbles of war and the growing threat to German Jews, instead continued pursuing his ambition to be a theatre performer and playwright. Laughing off disapproval from his father, Marcel would mime in theatres with a toothbrush moustache prop that could transform him into Charlie Chaplin – and Adolf Hitler.  But that all changed in  when, during Kristallnacht, rioters across Germany destroyed Jewish businesses and killed Jews in the street, leaving hundreds of children orphaned. A wealthy Strasbourg landowner “bought”  children orphaned in the slaughter from the Nazis and took them across the border to live in her chateau. She turned to Georges for help, and he recruited his cousin Marcel – simply to entertain and soothe the traumatised children. Jonathan says: “The Jewish Boy Scouts get a phone call from the woman asking for their help. So this very small, unprepared group of boy scouts suddenly had to take care of  orphans. They’re crying, they’re desperate and they are traumatised.  “They only had Yiddish as the common language because the kids were German and Austrian and these guys were French.” There was a huge language barrier and that’s when Georges, who died in , decided to ask his cousin Marcel Mangel to help. To Georges, Marcel was a clown, a performer, a mime, an actor, an artist. He wasn’t taken seriously. Jonathan says: Marcel reluctantly agreed to help them, and I found it really beautul how he completely changes. He goes from being an egotistical human being to a person who is truly devoted to saving the lives of these children. Unable to communicate with words, Marcel began using mime to help put the children at ease, first with a simple gesture that would later make him famous – a hand passed over his face from happy to sad and back again.  He then found ways to make them laugh, include a walk-against-the-wind routine that would later become his signature. When Hitler invaded France in , Marcel and the Jewish Boy Scouts fled with the children to Lyon, hiding with families in the city. In , Klaus Barbie was made head of the Gestapo in Lyon. Known as the Butcher of Lyon, he delighted in torturing and murdering Jews, children and members of the Resistance. Marcel and his brother forged documents to change the ages of French youths to make them too young to be sent to labour camps or, in the case of the non-Jewish children, to work in German factories.  He also changed his own surname from the Jewish Mangel to the French Marceau. As Jews in the city started to be rounded up, the Jewish Resistance decided to get the orphaned children to safety in Switzerland. Marcel led the children across the Alps on three trips. He used his mime and clowning to calm them when their papers were checked by the Nazi soldiers. Jonathan says: “Growing up in Strasbourg he knew German, so he taught the children German songs. It helped that he could talk to the soldiers in their own language.  “He was incredibly courageous. Switzerland had this law that said they weren’t accepting refugees, butyou were a child refugee and you made it to Switzerland they wouldn’t report you because it was a neutral country. “Once they were there, Save the Children would claim them. It was a safe haven so the whole effort was to get them there without the Nazis stopping them.” Jonathan says: “Marcel was involved in three operations at the beginning but the rest of the operation of the Jewish Boy Scouts together with Save the Children saved , children.” Marcel’s father Charles was caught by the Gestapo and killed in Auschwitz in .  Jonathan says: “The most moving story I heard is that Marcel tracked down where his father was sent, but nobody knew what Auschwitz was. He would sit and wait for the train that came back from Poland to seehis father would come back from this place.” After the war, Marcel became the most famous mime in the world, creating Bip, a melancholy clown with a white face, striped jumper and battered hat with limp flower. After success on the US stage and television in the mid-s, he performed Bip internationally for decades. His work inspired numerous stars, from actor Gary Cooper to magician David Copperfield. Michael Jackson famously asked him to create “the choreography of my lost childhood” and Marcel’s sketch Walking Against the Wind inspired Jackson’s moonwalk.

Imperial College Londonaposs Professor Neil Ferguson, who was a government adviser at the start of the pandemic, says it is only a matter of time until more places impose local lockdowns as Leicester has done following a spike of Covid- cases. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. And it is feared both Doncaster and Bradford could both see similar lockdowns following a worrying rise in the number of cases. Prof Ferguson told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Itaposs inevitable we will , we are relaxing lockdown rules and that means that contacts in the population are going up and thataposs a very iable process. Asked about Bradford and Doncaster, he said: Those are areas, where not as high as Leicester, but they have some of the highest numbers of cases per , of the population, which is the relevant measure, so theyaposre clearly of concern. Oxford Universityaposs Professor Peter Horby, who chairs the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group , also thinks England should expect more local lockdowns. Unfortunately I think we should, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Weaposve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, itaposs not the same in all places. And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks.  Doncaster reported two more coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, taking the death toll in the South Yorkshire town to . Figures show there were  new  coronavirus  cases in Doncaster between June -, which more than doubled the following week. Between June -,  new infections in the town were confirmed, taking the total to . Doncaster was the only place in South Yorkshire to record new coronavirus deaths yesterday and is second behind Leicester as an area that has seen a worrying spike.  But, Dr Rupert Suckling, Director of Public Health at Doncaster Council, said he is not concerned about any potential lockdown in the town. “More data is now becoming available nationally and this will be open to scrutiny and speculation, he said. Since the reporting of both pillar  and pillar  testing we have seen a high number of positive cases beginning with the week th to st May and this coincided with widespread testing in our care homes where we identied a number of asymptomatic positive cases. We have also seen cases in health and care workers, with sporadic cases in schools. However, the weekly testing from the week th -th June shows a signicant reduction.  We are not complacent and encourage everyone with symptoms to self-isolate and arrange to be tested. We are working closely with the local Public Health England centre which has not raised any concerns with us.

Fteen branches of the Tim Martin-owned pub chain remain on the market but will continue trading as normal until buyers are found. This includes two Lloyds No.  bars.The firm has been vocal throughout the coronavirus lockdown about re-opening as soon as possible - with pubs across most of England to begin trading again on Saturday .  Mr Martin received backlash after saying his staff should apos go and work in Tesco insteadapos in a shock video to his employees - in which he u-turned on a aposgenerous pay packageapos for all workers in March.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   He then announced in May the chain was spending £ million introducing a raft of changes to its pubs to ensure they were coronavirus-safe - weeks before Boris Johnson announced boozers could open their doors.Last week the PM also announced the social distancing rule would be halved to one metre in an effort to kick-start the economy. Under the new safety measures, Spoons staff will have to take part in temperature checks on arrival and two new full time workers will be hired per branch to help keep them sanitised.Safety screens are to be introduced at counters and between tables, while customers will be encouraged to pay via its smartphone app. Staff will also be provided with gloves, masks and protective eyewear, which will be made compulsory, subject to government guidelines. The list of all the branches on the market, initially announced in April last year, are: Brun Lea, Burnley, Lancashire Vulcan, Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire Time Piece, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire Bourtree, Hawick, Scottish Borders Last Plantagenet, Leicester, East Midlands Queens Hotel, Newport, Wales  Isaac Merritt, Paignton, Devon The Cross Keys, Peebles, Scottish Borders St Georgeaposs Hall, Redfield, Bristol Pennsylvanian, Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire Rhinoceros, Rotherham, South Yorkshire Butleraposs Bell, Stafford, Staffordshire Friar Penketh, Warrington, Cheshire Dee Hotel, West Kirkby, Merseyside Alexander Bain, Wick, CaithnessEddie Gershon, Wetherspoon spokesman, said at the time: It is a commercial decision taken by the company taken after long consideration. The pub will continue to trade as normal until a buyer is found.  “We have told our staff thatthe pub is sold and they do not transfer to the purchaser, then we would look to redeploy our employees at other Wetherspoon pubs in the region.” Chapel an Gansblydhen, Bodmin, Cornwall, had originally been on the list last year but is no longer for sale. Wetherspoon reported pre-tax profits of £.million for the six months to January  last year, which it blamed on an increase in staff wages. The re-opening of pubs, bars and restaurants on Saturday for the first time since March  is set to coincide with showers across much of England, along with strong winds. The expected wet weather means indoor venues could struggle to implement social distancing measures as people may ditch beer gardens and outdoor spaces to move inside out of the rain.Covid- infection rates are believed to be higher in inside spaces. Between -mm of rain is expected to fall, though temperatures could reach C in London and the South East, with humidity expected to be high.

The wearing of face coverings will not be mandatory for staff or customers, according to government guidance. Cineworld, which has about  cinemas around the UK, has said it has updated its booking system to ensure social distancing, and adapted its daily movie schedules to manage queues and avoid the build-up of crowds in lobbies.It has also said it has enhanced cleanliness and sanitation procedures across all sites. Meanwhile, Vue has said it is confident it can look after staff and customers with enhanced protocols and has learned how to operate from Taiwan, where its cinemas never closed, and from sites in Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, Poland and Lithuania where they have recently reopened to the public. Cinemas will encourage customers to use contactless payment methods. In preparation, the UK Cinema Associationhas released guidance for the safe re-opening of movie theatres, following consultation with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The advice, while dependent on any nation-specic restrictions, has been developed to ensure the continued safety of both audiences and staff, the UKCA said. Guidance includes measures to ensure social distancing throughout cinemas, with an emphasis on auditoriums and enhanced cleaning and hygiene procedures.Customers will be asked to use contactless payment where possible, the guidance said, while online booking will also be encouraged. Plastic screens will be installed at key contact points and film schedules will be adjusted to allow cleaning of auditoriums between screenings and to avoid crowding in corridors. The guidance is intended to apply to both cinemas in fixed buildings and mobile cinemas, the UKCA said, but it does not include drive-in cinemas and other open air screenings.  Phil Clapp, chief executive of the association, said: [The] launch represents an important next step in our efforts to once again bring the big screen experience to the cinema-going public. We know from recent surveys that a large proportion of our audience canapost wait to come back, but they understandably want to know the steps that cinemas will be taking to ensure their continued welfare.All Showcase cinemas and  Odeon cinemas around England will open after closing in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, with a mixture of recent releases and older offerings available to draw film fans back to theatres.The Odeon cinema at Manchesteraposs Trafford Centre will screen Sonic The Hedgehog, Birds Of Prey and Bad Boys For Le, which were all released earlier this year, as well as The Hangover from  and Batman Begins from . Other films directed by Christopher Nolan, including The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Dunkirk and Interstellar, will also be available later in the month, ahead of the release of his latest offering Tenet, which has already had its release date moved twice. Another  Odeons are also planned to reopen by the end of July, including the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square, which will reopen on July .  Showcase cinemas will also show older films on its opening day, including aposs Back To The Future and the  Oscar winner Bohemian Rhapsody. Vue cinemas will reopen on July , while Cineworld and Picturehouse has pushed back the date it plans to reopen cinemas following the easing of lockdown restrictions. The cinema chain will now not welcome back its UK customers until July , instead of July , because of changes to planned film release dates.

Alaska Airlines has warned passengersthey repeatedly shun face coverings they could face bans from future flights.It comes after passengers in the northern US state complained people werenapost wearing masks on board as they travelled during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Seattle Times, some passengers on a flight from Phoenix to Seattle last week repeatedly ignored crewsapos requests to don masks aboard the journey. The issue has become politicised in the US, where some are refusing to wear face coverings in public spaces where social distancing is required, and President Donald Trump has left it to inidual states to make their own rules.In the UK, wearing masks has been made mandatory by the government on public transport only.  But most British and European airlines have opted to make mask-wearing mandator y to curb the spread of Covid-.All major airlines now request passengers over six years old to wear a mask as part of new safety measures, meaning Brits must carry the face coverings as flights for holidays abroad slowly . Alaska Airlines has looked to the world of football for inspiration for its face mask warning system, which kicked in at the start of this month and is designed to catch passengers who repeatedly flout its rules. In a blog post, the airline said from early July, its flight attendants will be empowered to issue a final notice to any guest who repeatedly refuse to wear a mask or face covering on board its flights.  With that warning – in the form of a yellow card handed to them – the guest’s travel with us will be reviewed and could be suspended for a period. That would be a decision we do not take lightly. By working together, we do more for the common good. Alaska added: We realize a piece of fabric across your nose and mouth is probably not your ideal way to travel. Butwe all take that small step while flying, we’ll be better off in the long run. There would be some exceptions to the rule, the airline continued.  That included children aged under two, anyone with a medical issue that creates trouble breathing, passengers who cannot remove a mask without assistance, or anyone with a disability that prevents wearing a mask. The airline added removing the mask temporarily to eat and drink while passengers are seated will be allowed. From yesterday, passengers were being made to sign a mandatory health agreement during check-in to agree to the airlineaposs face mask policy.

Susan Anderson was in labour as her husband rushed her to Natural Birth Works in Coral Springs, Florida, on June .

Footage from a doorbell camera shows Susanaposs husband Joseph anxiously watching as the newborn slipped through one of the legs in her mumaposs shorts and was quickly caught by midwe Sandra Lovaina.The mum told Local  News : During the car ride to the birth center, I turned to my husband, and I was like, I need to push!apos.I didnapost think I wouldnapost make it into the building.

Two police officers who were in the area at the time also arrive at the scene. The midwe can be heard telling them: Itaposs okay, itaposs okay, Iaposm a midwe, sheaposs going to have a baby. Susan then screams as baby Julia slips through her shorts and Sandra grabs her just in time.

If you donapost clean it as you go, the grime and dirt builds up pretty easily, which leads to a lot of hard work later on. Whilst there are a tonne of products and methods online that promise to give you a gleaming oven - like The Pink Stuff Cleaning Paste that Mrs Hinch raves about or baking soda and vinegar - this one is new to us. A savvy mum has revealed just how easy it is to clean your oven without having to spend - what feels like - hours scrubbing it - and all you need is tin foil and a dishwasher tablet. She shared the video to TikTok and avid cleaners praised her for her aposle-changingapos hack. The woman starts by removing the trays from the oven, and then covers them completely in kitchen foil. She then pops them into the bath, before filling it with hot water - just enough to submerge the trays.  Finally, she puts a dishwasher tablet into the bath with the pans and leaves them to soak for two hours. Then you wait. After two hours remove the foil and youaposll be blow away. The once greasy and grotty pans, look brand new.  It might seem like magic but the secret is that a chemical reaction occurs between the foil and the tablets which breaks down all of the dirt. Now youaposll never have to scrub your oven again - genius. And many others thought so too as they praised the woman for sharing the idea. One said: Thank you! This is going to be le changing in my house! Another person in the comments said: You forgot to add: place the aluminium foil shiny side down onto the metal, thatapos the surface that attracts the dirt.

The disturbing incident took place in the city of Piripa, Brazil, just  days after twins Anne and Analu were born. Local media reports their mother Elaine Novais heard a sound coming from the room the twins were in while chatting to a neighbour. She was horried to find a their family dog attacking her daughters. She managed to rip the dog off them and called a family friend who is a nurse to help the tots. Mrs Novais, a council worker who had struggled to conceive for nine years, pulled the violent dog away from the twins, but it had already inflicted fatal damage on their abdomens.  She gave the girls first aid before they were taken to Maria Pedreira Barbosa Municipal Hospital, with doctors saying one of the girls was declared on arrival, whilst the other was in a serious condition. Doctors tried all they could but could not save the second girl’s le. The doctor at the hospital who was responsible for Elaine during her pregnancy said the mother had always shown adequate care for her babies.  The local council said in a statement: Faced with this immeasurable loss, we express our condolences and sympathy with parents Elaine and Regis, and their friends and family in this moment of sadness and pain. May God comfort your hearts and give you the strength to transform all the pain of this irreparable loss into faith and hope. The local authorities have said they do not plan to launch an investigation into the incident.  An unnamed family member told local media the dog - believed to be a Labrador cross -  was normally docile. We think that with the birth of the twins, the animal was left out in a way, and it no longer had the attention and affection of its owners provided before.

The line I had pasta tonight is not someone who is talking about what they had for dinner but is instead a cry for help. Other phrases used include I finished my shampoo and conditioner at the same time and are often used by TikTok users. One Reddit user believes the words have been taken from Hannah Dainsapos poem aposDonapost Kill Yourself Todayapos, which explains why a person struggling with depression should choose to stay alive. One line reads “finish your shampoo and conditioner at the same time” and another says to “tell someone your best pasta recipe.” Although some TikTok users actually talk about pasta or shampoo, many others post about these items for completely dferent reasons. But the comments to these meaningful posts can be powerful. One TikTok video captioned “Told my mom about my favorite pasta recipe and she made it for dinner tonight” received over three million views and , comments — all of which can be summed up by one user’s comment: “This comment section is my new therapy. Thank you.” “You’re so loved,” one person replied. “You haven’t come this far to only come this far,” another posted.“I love you all so much it’s beyond words,” the poster commented. “Thank you so much.

But no one could have predicted how this virus would affect clubs like ours.”The Dark Blues are all but certain to promote first-team coach Dave Mackay to take over as number two but no decision has been made yet.McPake made the point that he has other things on his mind right now.“I think it is too early to say what will happen,” said McPake.“Thatis not what’s in my head just now.“What I am thinking about is losing members of staff due to cost-cutting measures.”McPake yesterday confirmed he will not be involved in pay cut talks between the club and its players.The Dark Blues’ squad members have been asked to agree to salary reductions of around % and while Meekings said no and headed off to pastures new, experienced midfielder Paul McGowan has gone the other way and agreed to stay.McPake stressed it will be up to iniduals to do what is best for themselves and their families, and the pay discussions will be done at managing director level by John Nelms.He said: “I can confirm that there have been talks about deductions but that’s for iniduals and that’s way above me.“That’s something that I am not really involved in and, evenI were, it wouldn’t be fair for me to speak about as we are talking about people’s livelihoods and salaries.“Cuts have been offered but what each inidual’s cut is, that’s private between them and whoever is dealing with it at the club.“It will just be inidualised. Theymay come back to the club with dferent ideas, I don’t know.“They might all come back and say yes or they might say no. It is a tough one for me to predict and, as for a deadline, I genuinely don’t know.”Askedthe coaching staff had also been asked to take a pay cut, the Dens boss replied: “That’s not something I will go into.”As for Meekings, there were definitely no hard feelings towards the defender from his now former gaffer.McPake added: “Meeks is gone and that’s a shame because he did great for me as captain of this club.“He was offered a deal and it was his choice to say whether it was acceptable or not.“He chose to reject it but I wish him well for the future.“It is sad to see him go but I fully understand decisions that people make, particularly under the circumstances we are in with the pandemic.“I have no bad words to say about him at all.”On a brighter note, McPake was understandably upbeat regarding McGowan’s decision to say yes to his new terms.He said: “I am delighted that he committed himself to the club.“Gowser is a leader without even realising he is a leader.“He might moan a lot on the pitch at times but that is because he has high standards and he is often the one to express an opinion when he thinks the players are not hitting those high standards.“At times like these, you need people with character at your club and Gowser certainly has that.“He never shirks responsibility and that is why he has such real affinity with the Dundee fans.“I think the talks with him were over and done within a day or so. That shows you how keen he was to stay.”Talks between Dundee and prominent fans# group over a cash injection have collapsed\" title\"#Talks between Dundee and prominent fans# group over a cash injection have collapsed# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp talks-dundee-fans-group-cash-injection-have-collapsed embed # secretVmrceFxkXP\" data-secret\"VmrceFxkXP\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He really liked the club and the region where the club are based. It was just a good fit between the club and Steve himself.#Our area in Holland is full of people who are down to earth and Steve loved that. He#d gone from the pressure of getting the sack from England and all the attention that carried with it, to a small region in the east of Holland which is very quiet and he relished that.#The club was well run and well organised. You can ask anyone in Enschede and they all have nothing but positive things to say about Steve.#Hopefully, it will be the same with him and Dundee United too.#Brama says McClaren wouldn’t go into Tannadice and make wholesale changes – and he raved about the former Middlesbrough manager#s man-management skills.He recalled: #Steve had two periods with us as manager and, of course, he won us the league for the first time in our history in his first time at the club.#Him being manager made it a very, very positive experience for me.#When he first came in, the important thing for him was not to change everything straight away. In the beginning, he didn#t change a lot of things, he just observed.#He also didn#t bring in his own coaches, he kept the very good Dutch coaches we had at the club. He had Erik ten Hag, who is now Ajax manager, at the club as a coach and Alfred Schreuder as his assistant manager, who went on to manage Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.#So he used the coaches who were there and their knowledge and allowed the coaches here to do their job without interference and that certainly helped too.#He was a great manager for us. He was liked and respected by the players, coaches, everyone at the club in a very good way. He was the boss and everyone knew it.#For me as a player, he was fantastic. I was out of the team when Steve arrived because there were two new players who were in my position.#But he played me in a game against Arsenal in Europe when he needed a more defensive midfielder and I played just about every game since then.#He could trust me. I was only  at the time and I liked that he showed enough confidence in me as a young player to discuss tactics with me.#It was a very Dutch way to work and it was another example of how he adapted. He wanted to integrate with the Dutch way of playing, training and thinking and that#s what made him a big success.#Hopefully, he will be as big a success at Dundee United as he was at Twente.#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-malky-mackay-dundee-united embed # secretlLVCwFjUQ\" data-secret\"lLVCwFjUQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The group uses football to get men speaking and bring them together to show they are not alone at  this horrid time.#Fraser said that it often wasn#t easy for many men to talk about their feelings at such a dficult time, but he believed that by using football the men could come together and talk more openly about their loss.#It will give people a chance to open up and speak. We are the only second team in Scotland to have a team so want to help the men of Dundee as much as possible,# he added.#The whole perception of men is to not speak about their feelings, I want to break that mental health barrier that it#s okay not to be okay. It#s okay to be upset. It#s okay to cry.#The group is not concerned about ability and is more focused on getting men together to discuss what they have been through.The players also commemorate their babies# all too brief lives by proudly displaying their names on their home and away shirts.Fraser said that so far the team had five members and they were keen to recruit more men as quickly as possible.Anyone who wants to contact the team can get in touch via the #Sands United FC Dundee# Facebook page, the Twitter page @SUFC_Dundee, or by emailing sufcdundee@gmailFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped

bridges Also known as travel corridors, air bridges will allow Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken Last month, Heathrow Airport began trialling thermal screening technology to detect elevated temperatures of arriving passengers.Edinburgh Airport has implemented a colour-coded one-way system to maintain social distancing, while protective screens have been installed at check-in, security and arrivals, and staff wear face coverings and personal protective equipmentin ldquopassenger-facing areas.At Gatwick Airport, hand sanitiser stations, protective screens, regular deep cleaning and social distancing instructions have been introduced throughout the site, with face mask vending machines selling four masks for pound.Pre-booked airport security slots are being trialled at Manchester Airport, in which

youths verbally abusing passers-by, vandalising items, smashing bottles and leaving a mess behind. This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has. Please report any concerns to us on the  number, or  in an emergency.If we all work together we can improve our communities and keep our children and young people safe."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-week-tribute-east-lothians-retiring-msp","story":"Iain exemplies the very best in public service.His motivation and his hard work have always been about improving the lives of others.During his career at Holyrood, his contribution in health and social care, and in education, have helped improve the quality of le, and le chances, of many.I have had the privilege of seeing that work first hand, sharing an office with Iain in Tranent for five years.Iainrsquos values extend beyond his politics to the way he lives his le, and the way he responds to people.He is a great person to have as a colleague and friend.As well as being generous with his experience and advice, we shared many laughs.

Britons to go on holiday to certain destinations without needing to quarantine for  days on theirto the UK.Which countries are likely to be included The Government is expected to announce next week Britainrsquos first air bridges with ldquolow-risk European destinations, including France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany.According to reports, air bridges will be announced in batches, with the second set of destinations likely to include other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Holland and ldquolow-risk Caribbean islands.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said air bridges would only be agreed with countries which have a coronavirus test and trace system of the same standard as that used in Britain.When will air bridges be introduced The first air bridges to low-risk countries could be in force from July , but Mr Shapps said no announcement will be made until June  when the quarantine measures will be officially reviewed.Which countries are unlikely to be included There were mixed reports over whether Portugal would be included in the UKrsquos plans next week after a spike in coronavirus cases in the country.Long-haul flights to destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, Hong Kong are reportedly not expected before late summer.Flights to Australia are thought to be more complicated due to the need to stop over in other countries, which increases the risk of contracting or spreading coronavirus.What are the rules on quarantine Since June , all passengers ndash bar a handful of exemptions ndash have been required to go into self-isolation for  days when they arrive in the UK.People who fail to comply can be fined pound, in England, and police are allowed to use ldquoreasonable force to make sure they follow the rules.What measures have airports taken

moves through the faint, outer part of earths shadow.A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, therefore blocking some or all of the sunrsquos light from reaching the moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate, these are the local

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Actually, it started rather earlier: remember Ed Miliband and his Ed Stone  Itrsquos too early to tell whether Sir Keir Starmer will save Labour, but hersquos very much a metropolitan elite archetype, so I donrsquot have much hope of him delivering for Scotland.

His vision of a Labour landslide in the next UK General Election might well be a credible possibility, but Labours chances of winning in an independent Scotland are just as real,not better.

Similarly, middle class Scottish Tories are overwhelmingly pro-EU and, having lost their leader and more than half their MPrsquos while ldquoGet Brexit Done resonated in Westminster, they will be lukewarm at least to joining any referendum campaign predicated on a pro-Brexit message.I fear Mr Smith has picked up the wrong end of the stick. It would perhaps have been more pertinent to have addressed why there is now a sustained movement to majority support for independence. The six years since the first referendum have been a cumulative series of missteps by unionists ndash from David Cameronrsquos pronouncements in Downing Street the morning after the vote to the folly of Brexit and the deceit of the Johnson Cummings administration.The Covid- pandemic has been devastating throughout the UK. However, it has given Scottish voters a unique opportunity to compare the performance of the Scottish and Westminster governments in dealing with the same existential threat. By any measure, whether leadership, communication, or virus suppression, Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government have convincingly outperformed Boris Johnson and his cohorts.This has not gone unnoticed by Mr Smithrsquos middle-class voters who have drawn their own conclusions about the competence of the two governments.

But his diplomatic career culminated in the important, but not central, ambassadorship to Denmark. He then ran the important, but not central, Scotch Whisky Association, and was special advisor to Mr Johnson, as a Foreign Secretary who earned mixed reviews. Judging Mr Frostrsquos role as chief Brexit negotiator may be premature. But it is odd, after the justied criticism of Sir Mark Sedwillrsquos being both Cabinet Secretary and National Security Adviser, that Mr Frost should have to combine the climax of Brexit negotiations with whatever Middle Eastern politics, for instance, or terrorism, may serve up in the coming months.Choosing the new Cabinet Secretary matters more.

Recent developments provide them with further ammunition.On the one hand we have Boris Johnson proclaiming a New Deal comparable with that implemented by Franklin Roosevelt in the US in the s. Leaving aside for the moment the fact that Roosevelts programme was far greater in scope than that proposed by Mr Johnson ., what is interesting is that a Tory leader should come forward with such a series of measures in the first place. Where are the calls for a small state  Where are the calls for free markets  What has happened to the Masters of the Universe in the City of London Sir Tom Hunter appears to take a dferent view and, in terms of his economic principles, a more consistent one. In Scotland business must come to the fore and the rest of civil society marginalised with no apparent role or voice for, among others, universities, trade unions, environmental campaigners, political parties or the myriad of pressure groups which campaign on many key issues. It is not, I have to say, a prospect I find appealing.Before the crash in America with soup kitchens and \"bread lines knee deep in wheat\" there was a slogan, \"The Business of America is Business\". Scotland should strive for a broader, more rounded and inclusive view.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.TO put Boris Johnsonrsquos pound billion ldquoNew Deal package into some context, the UK Government is spending pound billion to refurbish the Palace of Westminster, including pound million for a House of Lords rooftop restaurant.Norway, which has produced roughly  per cent more oil and gas than Scotland, plans to spend a record  billion kronerof its sovereign oil wealth fund this year to weather the brutal Covid- downturn and announced a Government Bond Fund providing up to NOK  billionto be invested in bonds issued by Norwegian companies.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.BORIS Johnsonrsquos Recovery Plan is certainly modest incorporating an investment of poundbn when compared to the probable cost of HS at poundbn as predicted by a Government review in Jan . With the changing circumstances brought about by Covid-, how can this project still be justied especially as one of the outcomes of the pandemic may well be less travel and more working from home  These two sums of money are outrageously out of perspective with the needs of the British people at present.Stewart Jamieson, Dumfries.BORIS Johnson is among the most amiable of men, with the gt of the gab. However, his honeyed words seldom come to fruition. His latest speech on his ldquoNew Deal spending plan appears to be no more than fluff shuffling the same pack of cards not one extra penny of spending for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales, but then, Mr Johnson always promises more than he delivers. And,he had referenced ldquoEngland instead of ldquoUK, it would have been just the same speech.Under the guise of ldquoreform he is also getting rid of the most senior civil servant and National Security Advisor and replacing him with a political appointee. It used to be a commonly shared belief that the impartiality of the civil service was a jewel in the crown of the British State. Thus, for Tory party advantage, the foundations of that British state get a wee bit more shoogly, and our common ldquoSocial Contract less relevant.GR Weir, Ochiltree.NICOLA Sturgeon says she is \"extremely underwhelmed\" by Boris Johnsons economic recovery plan. She needs to look a little closer to home.Whilst her efforts to keep Scots healthy are laudable, her efforts on the economy are far less so, her latest gaffe being damaging the already hard-pressed tourist industry. Kate Forbes, her Finance Secretary, has had to \" request\" extra financial aid from Westminster but this is not helped by the general attitude of the SNP that suggests any refusal will simply be another reason to go for independence.Our current SNP Green government is far too blinded by this prospect to actually notice the reality that,Scotland actually voted for independence, then there are no viable answers to running the finances successfully. Talk is cheap, nothing  is.Ms Sturgeon must stop governing by spurious poll results and deal with the real situation on the ground. Currently we have almost no productive economy to speak of but rapidly rising costs and debts. If Scotland is going to be an independent country soon, then there should be no need to ask Westminster for money.

It also calls on each inidual island to decide the best route out of lockdown.But Ms McNeill says she has been subjected to online abuse and accused of being racist and anti-English as she has separately called as part of the campaign for only Scottish residents to be allowed as the nation was \"a low-risk area\".And she says her petition has helped stir up \"civil wars\" on the islands with what she describes as wealth pitted against health and islanders pitted against each other.She said: \"Some of the larger islands will not be able to survive the economic impact of holding off tourism for another , ,  months.

They have to have continued access to priority delivery slots and guarantees that they can get essential groceries when they need them.ldquoWe recognize the work done by supermarkets at the start of the crisis to help customers, but it appears that some of the most vulnerable older people are still not getting the service they so desperately need. We look to the Scottish Government to work with the retailers to come up with a solution as a matter of urgency.The research uncovered what was described as an \"alarmingly mixed picture\" with similar issues to Scotland in Wales, whle just one in four in England registered food issues and two in five in Northern Ireland.The study found that in Scotland well over a thirdwere relying on friends and familyand supermarket deliveriesto get food and essential groceries. Just under a quarterhave been visiting supermarkets.Over three in four vulnerable consumers in Scotland said itrsquos been more dficult to get food in lockdown.Other concerning reports given to Which  included a -year-old lady who had to wait  weeks for her first food parcel despite registering in week one and a -year-old with shingles who had to wait a month between supermarket click and collect slots.Among the shielded group - those who are the most high-risk to coronavirus and for whom the most help, including priority supermarket delivery slots and food parcels, has been offered - Which  found that there was still a very high proportion of people facing dficulty getting the food and essentials needed in the week they were surveyed.This figure was highest in England where a thirdof those shielding had struggled, while three in in Northern Ireland, over a quarter in Scotlandand a quarter in Walesalso faced dficulties.Which  said it was concerned that while the easing of lockdown restrictions may make le easier for people who are comfortable with and able to go into shops again, there is still a huge risk that many of those who have already been struggling will now be cut further adrt as they may still not be able to leave their homes to get groceries - especiallyit involves long queues, taking a taxi or using public transport.The consumer organisation is calling for access to free food boxes, priority delivery slots and other relevant assistance to be made available for as long as medical advice or practical restrictions, such as social distancing, are in place. The help should be extended to include not only the most-high risk but also those who are situationally vulnerable and have so far been sidelined.This would mean that central and local governments will need to accurately assess and identy which consumers remain vulnerable so that they can also be given access to appropriate support such as priority supermarket delivery slots or local food provision through other means.:Edinburgh womanwho has battled cervical cancer and brain tumours fronts new UK-wide Cancer Research fundraising appealSue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at Which  said:ldquoIt is a real concern that months into lockdown, the current system of food provision is still not working for so many of those who need it the most. Some people could now be looking at a clf edge where shielding restrictions are lted and they are left to fend for themselves, cut off from outside help in getting essential groceries.ldquoWhich  is now calling for the UKrsquos four governments to work with the food industry, local authorities and charities to ensure a longer-term plan for supporting all of those who are at risk and need support is in place by the end of July, so that no vulnerable person faces dficulties in accessing the basic food supplies they need.Commenting on research by Which  showing vulnerable people in Scotland are struggling to access food supplies, Scottish Labour MSP Elaine Smith said: ldquoThese concerning findings raise serious questions about both the UK and Scottish Governmentrsquos handling of the emergency response to the pandemic. Now more than ever, we have a duty to protect the most vulnerable people in our society, and it is clear that many in this category have been failed.ldquoThis has exacerbated the longstanding and growing issue of food poverty in Scotland.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There is not a moment more to be lost.ldquoThis is a sector that generates billions for the national coffers, helping fund our NHS, public services and the Governmentrsquos promised infrastructure spend. It supports jobs theand breadth of the country and is central to UK national security.ldquoAerospace is exactly the sort of high-skilled industry, based in the communities that need to be at the heart of the Prime Ministerrsquos promised levelling up efforts.ldquoThis is a flexible, committed workforce. It stepped up during this crisis, manufacturing ventilators and other equipment desperately needed for the NHS and to protect the public. They deserve so much more than a government that turns a deaf ear to requests for assistance.ldquoWhile aerospace workers in France and Germany are being embraced by their government, kept in decent paid work, working a shorter working week and retraining in preparation for the upturn, playing their part in building a greener, stronger economy, our governmentrsquos inertia will see thousands of jobs lost and more of our business move overseas.Mr Turner warned that recent job losses will ldquosnowball into an avalanche of further redundancies without help.A Government spokesman said: ldquoWe understand this is a dficult time for businesses and workers across the aerospace sector and stand ready to support those at risk of losing their jobs.ldquoThe aerospace sector remains a critical part of the UK economy and we will continue to work closely with industry to ensure it can rebuild as the civil aviation market recovers.ldquoWhile conditions remain challenging, firms can continue to draw on the Governmentrsquos financial support packages, including billions of pounds of loans and guarantees, tax deferrals and the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.copy -.

It is also hoped to help Shetland#s existing oil and gas industry achieve carbon net zero targets.Plans for the hub are still in early stages with no specic projects agreed.

This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows.

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication. If a customer is concerned about the identity of a caller to their home they can call the PSNI ‘Quick Check’ service on .

But he said that afterwards we absolutely have to look at what market demand looks like. He added thatthe market prospects appear strong to us then we are committed to make further investments in that sector.Belfast Harbour yesterday announced solid financial results, with turnover down % to £.m and operating profits down % to £.m.The fall was down to the end of a major offshore wind farm sustainable energy contract, which had been worth around £.m, and a fall in the amount of coal passing through the port. However, Mr O#Neill said the harbour was hopeful of attracting more wind farm occupants to a facility currently occupied by cruise ships. He said it was the best facility of its kind for wind farms.But he said new £m cruise ship facilities would not now be built until there is both a pick-up in demand for cruises, and more wind farm clients. And he said he hoped there could be more demand from the Republic for wind farm work now that the Green Party is sharing power.Mr Dobbin said the harbour had managed to offset the loss of the wind farm contract as it had benefited from a full year#s trading of the AC Marriott Hotel and business at its multi-storey car park.Belfast Harbour#s City Quays  and  offices are home to a large number of corporates, with many employees now working from home.

She said it also came at the “worst possible time” given many victims were just about to go into isolation due to the coronavirus emergency.“The message of that was appalling,” she told MPs.Ms Peake noted that the first paragraph of the two-page Government statement focused on the need to protect veterans.“So we were waiting for Stormont House , we felt there was an agreement among the British and Irish governments and the Assembly, we were waiting for an action for that,” she said.“We had no warning and, all of a sudden, in the middle of Covid, a two-page statement came out that really was a demarcation away, with absolutely no warning, at a time when victims and survivors were most vulnerable.“The first paragraph was around the need to protect veterans and then moved on to victims and survivors.“As of last week, we have had one call with the Secretary of State , we’ve had nothing since. We have asked for meetings with the NIOofficials, we’ve had two, which we have asked for, and we were told there’s going to be extensive consultation, we haven’t seen that.“We were told that there would be papers, they haven’t come, and I understand maybe they won’t come.“So it’s really a very, very dficult position for victims and survivors to be in and I really can’t emphasise enough it really feeds mistrust, it feeds a sense that we don’t matter, and that this simply is about veterans and is not about addressing the needs of victims and survivors, and that is grossly unfair.“It’s very unfair to victims and survivors to do that.”Member of the South East Fermanagh Foundationvictims’ group also gave evidence to the committee on Wednesday.Seff has four outreach bases across Northern Ireland and also operates a service in London for the benefit of victims and survivors in Great Britain.Director of Services Kenny Donaldson said the Stormont House proposals were “unacceptable and unworkable”.Mr Donaldson insisted it should be the PSNI’s role to investigate legacy crimes, rather than bringing in officers from where in the UK.He also told MPs the Irish government needed to fully participate in the process and disclose relevant information.The campaigner said any new legacy mechanisms should be founded on the principle that there was never any justication for the use of criminal violence for political objectives.“Over the - period there should have an acknowledgement that criminal violence was wrong and wholly unjustied, that didn’t happen but a quarter of a century later it must now happen, otherwise whatever we seek to achieve on legacy will continue to be built on sand,” he said.“There is a need to re-calibrate society now”.He added: “The Republic of Ireland State sought to portray itself as an onlooker to the problems of Northern Ireland, this is not accurate and there must be a sea change within that attitude, we seek a dferent level of commitment on these issues from the new government recently elected.“There needs to be a much closer collaboration between the ious jurisdictional governments on these issues, no innocent victim or survivor should be left behind.“We believe that we have submitted alternative proposals around an investigative body being housed within the PSNI which are workable, fair, affordable and crucially can deliver outcomes for victims and survivors and we ask for this committee’s detailed consideration of those proposals and moreover, the UK Government’s”.PAMost ReadNoah Donohoe poured #letime of love# into  years, funeral toldBobby Storey funeral a kick in teeth, says woman forced to miss mum#s burialMichelle O#Neill defends attending Bobby Storey funeral Noah Donohoe: Private funeral for Belfast teenCoronavirus Northern Ireland: O#Neill #satisfied# her actions were within regulations at Storey funeral, but says selfie #should not have happened#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We were putting the bears out for three weeks before someone suggested raising funds, which of course we did.Marie Curie is a cause so many people identy with and they have an office close to our house. That#s how we chose them and we are over the moon with the amount we raised.I had initially hoped that we would collect somewhere in the region of £, or £,, so to raise over £, has been amazing.While being able to make such a generous donation to Marie Curie was an unexpected outcome, receiving a coveted Harrods bear in the post was another.My we has about  Harrods bears in her collection, Morris explained.I gave her a bear every Christmas before I retired and was travelling back and forward to London. Of course, these were part of our daily display.I never could have imagined anyone from Harrods would see our story in the Belfast , let alone send this year#s bear as a thank-you to us.It was such a generous gesture and a big surprise when the bear arrived in the post with a lovely note from Harrods.I wrote back updating them on the final tally collected for Marie Curie and to say a big thank-you.The bear, which is called Nicolas, is a very welcome addition to the collection. It will be a constant reminder of this very unusual time we have found ourselves in.

moving words during Requiem Mass to pay tribute to the south Belfast teenager.And he revealed that Strabane native Fiona, who was accompanied by parents Gerry and Margo and sisters Niamh and Shona, had told him how fortunate she felt to have had even such a short time with her beloved son.She said, #I have been so blessed. Noah was a beautul soul with a beautul mind#, said Fr McGinnity.He poured a whole letime of love into my le in  short years.Read MoreClaire McNeilly:Opinion Tears and white roses, balloons and applause as community le halts for Noah Donohoe funeralA bunch of flowers was fixed to the church railings, along with posters bearing the tragic teen#s picture and the words Rest in Peace Noah.Upon arrival, the hearse was escorted by a guard of honour led by members of his former basketball team, Belfast Phoenix, and by school friends wearing their St Malachy#s College unorms. Inside was a large framed photograph of Noah and his mother Fiona, showing both of them smiling, with the St Malachy#s school crest above it. A black and green ribbon - the colours of St Malachy#s - was tied to the handle of the white coffin. After Mass the cortege, which was en route to Roselawn cemetery, made a brief stop at the Antrim Road college, where Noah, described in the homily as someone who carried his potential so lightly and so humbly, was a Year  student.Pupils and teachers lined the avenue leading up the school to pay their respects.Outside, a large crowd had gathered making social distancing dficult.The gates of the school have become an impromptu shrine to its lost boy, with the iron work emblazoned with flowers, candles and messages of sympathy.Earlier, Fr McGinnity said Noah#s grieving friends and schoolmates were also in the family#s thoughts.Indeed, right now, students from Noah#s form class are attending a prayer service... together they will be remembering the joy and goodness that he brought into the lives of so many, the priest said. We remember the messages they sent to Noah#s family, and the many tributes they paid on social media and across the airwaves. Those messages and tributes have been a source of immense comfort.One of his close friends said on social media during the week, #Noah had so much potential in everything he did#.What endeared him to his friends was the fact that he carried that potential so lightly and so humbly. As a natural leader he wanted everyone to appreciate their own gts and talents. More than that, he wanted them to find the joy in living that he had found.Read More Noah Donohoe changed our world: Search hero#s tribute to Belfast teenNoah#s body was found in an underground storm drain in north Belfast six days after he failed toto his home in the Ormeau area in the south of the city. His disappearance sparked one of the most intensive searches for a missing person in Northern Ireland#s history. Police believe he might have suffered a head injury after falling off his bicycle and could have been disorientated when he entered the drain.The search for the popular schoolboy brought together hundreds of people from across the city and beyond, uniting the two main communities in a common purpose.Noah and his mother had a personal connection with the church, which was, Fr McGinnity said in his homily, their spiritual home.It was here, in this church that Fiona taught Noah as a child to thank God for his le and to remember that he, like every child, has been sent into the world to share God#s love with everyone, he said, adding that Noah was the kind of boy who was just full of the joy of living.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandClaire McNeillyOpinionTears and white roses, balloons and applause as community le halts for Noah Donohoe funeralNoah Donohoe came back to north Belfast on Wednesday.

This was a % increase on the  figure .The fixed speed camera site on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast accounted for more than one-thirdof the , speeding detections by fixed cameras in .Over halfof all speed related detections were on mph roads.The highest speed recorded in  was mph. This was detected on the A Dunman dual carriageway near Cookstown, a mph road.Other bad examples included a driver caught at mph in a mph zone and another doing mph in a mph zone.RSP vans were deployed , times in , an increase of % on deployments in , partly explaining the rise in detections.The data is contained in the NI RSP#s latest annual bulletin. There are four fixed speed cameras, six fixed red light running cameras and one average speed enforcement camera system here. Eight speed camera vehicles also operate at ious locations throughout the region.The number of speed detections in  was more than four times the total recorded in  .The main reason was the reduction in the speed threshold at which a driver can be detected speeding. Additional sites for enforcement were also added in  and .Detections at fixed camera sites totalled , - down by % when compared with .The fixed site on the Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast, accounted for % of detections by fixed cameras, followed by Springfield Road, Belfast , Antrim Road, Belfastand Saintfield Road, Belfast . The Saintfield Road cameras had signicant downtime throughout .The number of detections at mobile camera sitesincreased by % between  and .This followed an increase in deployments of safety camera vans, resulting in more detections.The , other cases were detected by #average speed# cameras.Inspector Leech said everyone had a responsibility to make our roads safer.She added: Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le-changing injuries.All right-thinking and law-abiding motorists will realise that speed restrictions are not there to inconvenience them but to make our roads safer for everyone. Our aim is to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed. As speeding is considered one of the major causes in road traffic collisions, we make no apology for adopting a tough approach to enforcement.All motorists have a duty to drive in a responsible manner, butthey do not then we have a duty to detect and prosecute them.Infrasturcture Minister Nichola Mallon said: Unfortunately, for many families excessive speeding is persistently one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads and this is unacceptable.Speeding isn#t just about doing  or  miles per hour. It is about going too fast for the conditions.As a driver, it is your responsibility to adapt your driving - according to the weather, the type of road, your own ability and enough to expect the unexpected.So far  people have lost their lives on Northern Ireland#s roads this year.

Another was found to have driven through a mph zone at mph and in once case, a driver was caught speeding through a mph area at mph.Mr Sherrard said: I actually find it very distressing to think that someone - anyone - would think it is acceptable to drive at mph on any road.There is no way that driver was in control of the car at that speed so the potential to kill some innocent person or themselves is obvious. He continued: Driving through a built up area with a speed limit of mph at almost mph is, in my opinion, the absolute height of irresponsibility.And I really hope that the person detected doing that speed felt the full rigours of the law.We have members in Le After who lost loved ones through road traffic collisions perhaps  or  years ago and they are still suffering, they are still missing their loved one every day just as we continue to miss my father every day.If you take someone#s le because of your driving, you have to live with the consequences of that for ever.I don#t believe anyone who gets into a car and drives over the speed limit intentionally sets out to kill anyone butthey do they are bringing that burden on their own shoulders too. I can#t imagine it is an easy thing to live with.While many speeding offences are at the lower end of the scale, Mr Sherrard said even a few miles per hour over the recommended limit could cause devastation.He added: It beggars belief that in spite of the very graphic road safety ads we see on our television screens depicting how even a few miles an hour over the speed limit can cause catastrophic damage, so many people think there is nothing wrong with speeding.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in yearThe number of speeding offences in Northern Ireland has surged by % year-on-year.Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a kick in teeth, says woman forced to miss mum#s burialMichelle O#Neill defends attending Bobby Storey funeral Noah Donohoe: Private funeral for Belfast teenBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUPCoronavirus Northern Ireland: O#Neill #satisfied# her actions were within regulations at Storey funeral, but says selfie #should not have happened#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration. CASE STUDY QUEEN’S HOTEL Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak. googletag.cmd.push The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth. Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.  THERE FOR YOU: Queen’s Hotel lit up for NHS andpreparing food in the kitchen Megan put a post on the Portsmouth Coronavirus Support Group on Facebook asking members to support her idea and it has since taken off with donations pouring in from iniduals and businesses. googletag.cmd.push She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing. “I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel. “I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded. “The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.” Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes. The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.”  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two pound, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.” Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.” CASE STUDY HIGHLAND AUTO CAMPERS When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill. So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would. But then came the problem of where to put them. The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’” “I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.” Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost. While they’d normally charge pound a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just pound each a week. Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked. “But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.  TEAMING UP: Highland Auto Campers owner Mark Jarratt with girlfriend Alicia “Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus. “They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site. They wanted to rent three of our vans to do this. “We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help. “It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing. “Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up. “The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.” Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!” The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.” CASE STUDY SHNUGGLE Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business. Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, airflow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations. But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown. Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives. Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield. Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world. “A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’. “We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.  DREAM TEAM: The Shnuggle staff “We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised pound, in the end. “We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.” Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running. Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS. “It was worth shy of poundm and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.” So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

Ciaraacuten McShane died last Monday as a result of a road collision on a stretch of the M motorway in County Louth. On Sunday, mourners at the Church of St John the Baptist heard how the -year-old father-of-two had been working to establish a family home for what he called his ‘wee unit’. Fr Charles Kearney told those gathered for his funeral that the former Crossroads PS and St Paul’s pupil had a great sense of humour. googletag.cmd.push “The fourth and youngest of his family, he turned out to be great craic, very quick-witted,” he said. “He had many, many friends. He was a good son and brother. When he began to go out and about, he ended up in Maghera, in Walsh’s Hotel, where he met the love of his le. “They were together for eleven years, and six, of course, as man and we. They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cha’s - victory over Manchester City on Thursday confirmed the Merseysiders could no longer be mathematically caught and sparked wild celebrations. For local fanatic Gerard Harraghy, the overwhelming emotion was relief, rather than ecstasy. “The main emotion is a little bit of relief that it’s finally confirmed, to be honest,” he told the County Derry Post. “We knew it was going to happen for a while, but there was that bit of doubt over the last three months that it might not actually get finished is now over. googletag.cmd.push “In a cup final, you have that one moment when you win it, but because it is the league, you don’t really get that. “While we may have clinched it last night, there were actually three or four moments throughout the season that were bigger in inidual terms.” Supporters Barry Craig, Kieran Patterson and David McLaughlin celebrate in a marquee off the new Dungiven bypass. The Magherafelt native, known affectionately to some of his old school friends as ‘Gerry Scouse’, admits the success was dampened a little with supporters not being able to witness it. “I definitely never envisaged being stuck over here and not being able to go to the match,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “A few friends did send me pictures and videos from last night in Liverpool and everyone seemed to be having a good time anyway. “I’ve been supporting Liverpool since I was about six or seven, I would say. I started going regularly before I started uni and for the past ten years it’s been pretty much every home game. “I’ve been on the waiting list for a season ticket for about  years, maybe more. I’m still only about ,th on the list!” While Liverpool’s stretch without a league title lasted three decades, they were not without success in the interim, winning the Champions’ League twice. The emotion of Istanbul in , when Liverpool came from three goals down at half-time to win the Champions’ League on penalties, will always be the pinnacle for Gerard. “I still don’t think anything will ever come close to Istanbul, for me,” he recalled. “It was right in the middle of my A-Levels and I had an exam the next morning, but I did not care one bit! “I would say the league is probably bigger than last year’s Champions’ League, just because it’s the first time we’ve done it in my memory.” As well as ending a -year drought, Liverpool’s th title brings them within one of fierce rivals Manchester United after the latter surged ahead with a period of dominance in the s and s. Gerard watched the game that clinched the  title at home with a few friends. One of them was a Manchester United fan, and the Magherafelt man took great pleasure in his discomfort. “A couple of mates came round and we watched it in the house,” he said. “One of them was actually a Man United fan. He tried to sneak out with about five minutes to go, but we had to lock him in! “I’m pretty sure I’m going to have him deleting his Facebook account by the end of the week with the amount of stuff I’ll be posting. It’s nice to get a bit of revenge after all these years.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Such prejudice and discrimination such as this must be called out for what it is, it must not go unchallenged.” googletag.cmd.push Local Mid Ulster District Councillor, Darren Totten, said homophobia had no place in society and urged anyone with information to contact the PSNI. “I hope that anyone who is struggling and received this literature understands that the majority of decent people would condemn the hatred for what it is,” he said. “Magherafelt is a brilliant town, with a close-knit community who have come together during lockdown to prepare homes for healthcare workers, in clean ups and initiatives which are for the betterment of everyone. “Its devastating to see the small-minded bigotry of a few iniduals who want to drag us all backwards, but the vast majority of the recipients of this letter will have seen it for what it was. googletag.cmd.push “I would call on anyone with information to come forward to the PSNI.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district.

Photo: Victoria Jones PA WireThe protests were against police officers’ use of force, their attitudes to black people and a lack of accountability for their actions.The demonstrations took place, of course, at the same time as the country was addressing the coronavirus emergency, as the whole world still is.Despite the sense of a crisis within a crisis that developed, it was good to hear Microsoft Corporation co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates telling the BBC that, despite being “very imperfect”, the United States is still “amazing in a lot of ways” not least when it comes to medical research into vaccines and despite “current challenges”.Canon Ian M Ellis, who is a former editor of The Church of Ireland Gazette \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...President Trump’s appearance for a photo-opportunity outside St John’s episcopal church, not far from the White House, holding a Bible, led to much revulsion, including comments by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland’s new moderator, Dr David Bruce, that Mr Trump had “crossed the line” by using religious symbols.The president’s actions were inappropriate, provocative and most regrettable.Moreover, the US Episcopal Church’s News Service indicated that leaders of the denomination, with which the Church of Ireland is in communion, had condemned the reported use of tear gas and rubber bullets to clear clergy and protesters from the area around St John’s so that President Trump could use it as he did.Mr Trump “used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes. This was done in a time of deep hurt and pain in our country, and his action did nothing to help us or to heal us,” Presiding Bishop Michael Curry said.The Bishop of Washington, Rt Rev Mariann Budde, told ‘The Washington Post’ she had been “outraged”, adding that everything Mr Trump “has said and done is to inflame violence. We need moral leadership, and he’s done everything to ide us”.Perhaps one of the most striking responses to the George Floyd killing and President Trump’s actions came with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, pausing speechless for over twenty seconds before answering a reporter’s related question.He then said: “We all watch in horror and consternation what’s going on in the United States. It is a time to pull people together but it is a time to listen. It is a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress over years and decades.”Yet he went on to call on Canadians to accept that there is a parallel problem in their country, stating: “It is a time for us as Canadians to recognise that we too have our challenges, that black Canadians and racialised Canadians face discrimination as a lived reality every single day.”Indeed, racism is a global scourge and a real human indignity.Claire Stam, a writer for the ‘Euractiv’ website which focuses on EU policy and politics, recently recalled the first anniversary of the murder of the former president of Germany’s Kassel district, Walter Lübcke.Mr Lübcke had been responsible for the accommodation of refugees and had been threatened because he stood for democratic values and a humane refugee policy, Claire Stam wrote, adding bluntly: “On  June , he was found dead, shot in the head.”She went on to point out that over the past year “two racist-motivated murderous attacks” followed in the German cities of Hanau and Halle and that this month Senegalese-born German MP Karamba Diabyhad been sent a tweet telling him he is “not welcome” in Germany.Closer to home, Northern Ireland does not have a good reputation either as far as race relations go.Statista, the data providing company, has analysed the number of racially motivated hate crimes in Northern Ireland during the period -, reporting a low point of less than  offences in  , but indicating that “a drastic growth of race crime was recorded in the following years”, rising to a new peak in   with , racist incidents.Belfast has been called the race-hate capital of Europe, which is nothing less than a disgraceful epithet for Northern Ireland’s capital.However, the public expressions of protest at George Floyd’s killing that have taken place in Belfast, while rendering social distancing dficult to say the least, have highlighted a dferent attitude.At the same time, Chief Constable Simon Byrne and the Public Health Agency’s head of health protection, Dr Gerry Waldron, both rightly issued important warnings.The chief constable tweeted that while he condemned the murder of George Floyd, “public protests at this time will endanger lives”, adding: “We must support #BlackLivesMatter but also stop the spread of Covid-.”Dr Waldron said: “We’ve got to bear in mind that the virus hasn’t got any conscience and ... doesn’t recognise good causes.”The death of George Floyd in such tragic and disturbing circumstances must surely cause every person, here and around the world, to think deeply about their own attitudes.• Canon Ian Ellis is a former editor of The Church of Ireland Gazette——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It is also greater than her position being rendered untenable by her action.Even should O’Neill step down, her replacement would come from the ranks of those complicit in usurping the law on social distancing.The decisive action resting with the DUP leadership is to inform the prime minister that they can no longer serve in the executive with Sinn Fein.David McNarry, Comber——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The vast majority of the applications appear to be by bands for July , a Monday, with only a handful of Orange Lodges applying. Many of the applications relate to greater Belfast.The News Letter asked the Parades Commission it would be approving applications which adhere to guidelines andit had any advice for organisers in how to comply with restrictions.A spokesperson for the Parades Commission said:“During lockdown, the majority of band parade organisers agreed to withdraw their notications to parade.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“Since the easement on Monday evening permitting up to  persons outdoors, bands have submitted new notications, mostly for the Twelfth. Fty parade notications have been received today and yesterday, with more anticipated. Details are on the Commission’s website.”It added that parades are subject to Covid- Regulations, the enforcement of which is a matter for the NI Executive and PSNI.The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland has restated its position that traditional Twelfth of July parades will not take place this year in light of the pandemic. However it approved the small paradesthey complied with safety requirements.A spokesman said: “We note that several bands have indicated their intention to apply for parades within their communities, with no more than  members and adhering to the social distancing guidelines for the purpose of entertaining people in their gardens and at their front doors. Bands have rightly asked members of the public not to follow them. Instead, they have encouraged a ‘stay at home’ message with the band bringing music to them. This is a model the Institution would support as it compliments our ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign.”It has been reported that the Attorney General has told the Parades Commission that it has no legal powers to prevent bands from marching on The Twelfth.Aletter, seen by the Belfast , was reportedly sent to the watchdog from the Attorney General’s Office earlier this month. It reportedly said that the Coronavirus health regulations do not “ban parades of any nature” and as such, the Commission has “no enforcement powers”. The Commission declined to confirm to the News Letter whether it had received such a letter.Last month Broughshane man Craig Sloan expressed “shock” to the News Letter after the Commission declined to process his application for a socially distanced parade of six people on July , which he believed was within lawful limits at that time. The commission argued that Coronavirus legislation forbade parades because because they came under restrictions on movement and gatherings.Meanwhile, First Minister Arlene Foster was asked by RTE at a press conference todaySinn Fein’s conduct at the funeral of leading republican Bobby Storey this week would be likely to encourage unionists to ask why they could not parade in July Mrs Foster replied: “Nobody enjoys the marching season as much as I do ... and I have to say the leadership of the Orange Order and the Black Preceptory and the Apprentice Boys has been very clear that they want to protect the community that they live in.”They don’t want people to catch the Coronavirus. They do want to celebrate in a way that is not only safe but that recognises the time of the year that we are in.”And you know what.... two wrongs don’t make a right... I am asking them to continue to work with the Executive as they have been. I met with the officers of the Grand Orange Lodge last Friday.“We had a hugely constructive meeting about how we could celebrate in a way that did not put people in danger and I will continue those conversations.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Powys.NRW proposed the dam as one option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal case for this option, it is therefore clear that we will not be pursuing an upstream storage scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south

favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to

Borough Council looks set to agree to waive the licence fee for on street cafes.By The NewsroomWednesday, st July , : pm\"\"Portadown Town Centre.The decision was agreed upon at a meeting of Council’s COVID- working group, held behind closed doors on Tuesday evening, the Local DemocracyReporting Service understands.The decision will ensure that cafes who register for and are granted an on-street licence between now and December  will have until October ,  to trade and seat their customers at tables on streets, without paying a fee to Council.The working group also agreed to suspend parking charges for Council owned, paid for, car parks within the Borough until st August and then again for the month of the December .While members of the group agreed that this is the positive way forward, it was also noted that parking attendantswill still be patrolling these areas and those who abandon cars across two or more parking bays can still expect to be punished.While up to  people can now gather at cemeteries across the Borough, it is understood a decision was reached last night for Council to write to the Executive to request clarication on the possibility of increasing that number further.While these decision were agreed upon last night, they will not be made official until they are ratied at a meeting of the full Council later this month, though that process is expected to be little more than a formality.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\"
