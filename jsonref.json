Heard filed for orce the following year, and the orce was finalized in 2017.The former spouses have both been in court during three weeks of testimony at the grand neo-Gothic court building.Ms Wass reminded Mr Justice Nicol there were \u0027well-documented episodes of violence and destruction\u0027 over Depp\u0027s adult life and that the actor had accepted he was violent to inanimate objects but not people.However, she said there was an incident earlier in his career when he assaulted a photographer with a plank of wood when under the influence of drink and drugs.She also said his evidence that he was not violent towards people was \u0027meaningless\u0027 when he was as intoxicated as he was on occasions and \u0027wouldn\u0027t have known what he was doing\u0027.Ms Wass continued: \u0027In answer to what we suggest is overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, catalogued over a three-year period between 2013 and 2016, Mr Depp\u0027s response is to claim that he is a victim of an elaborate hoax that has been perpetrated against him by Ms Heard and her friends.\u0027The barrister said Depp had accused Heard and her friends of \u0027having painted on injuries, manipulated photographs and destroyed property which they then went on to photograph in order to create what he describes as some sort of insurance policy for Ms Heard\u0027.Ms Wass added: \u0027What exactly Ms Heard was insuring against in the course of this hoax remains unexplained.\u0027She told the court that such a hoax \u0027would have entailed Ms Heard engaging in a pre-planned conspiracy over the period of the entire relationship with Mr Depp\u0027, adding: \u0027Such a suggestion, we say, is risible.\u0027Ms Wass told the court: \u0027The approach taken by Mr Depp from the time Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him on May 27 2016 was as follows: to deny that he ever assaulted Ms Heard, to accuse Ms Heard of being the violent party and to reverse his role with hers.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/09/0C068B1800000578-5548741-Kate_and_Gerry_McCann_mark_the_fourth_anniversary_of_the_disappe-m-2_1524816157149.jpg","title":"Madeleine McCann investigators resume digging German allotment","story":"Share this articleShare this articleFall Maddie: Polizei setzt Spurensuche in Garten bei Hannover fortFall Maddie in Hannover: Ermittler finden Keller auf Gartengelände - News Inland - Bild.de"},{"url":null,"title":"Oldham overtakes lockdown Leicester highest second coronavirus infection rate England","story":"Share this articleExplained: What caused Oldham\u0027s new coronavirus crisis, where are the spikes in infection rates and how will the town get out of this? - Manchester Evening NewsManchester Evening News: Number one for news, opinion, sport \u0026amp celebrity gossip"},{"url":null,"title":"Bakery turns away customers aged 94 86 didnt cards wanted pay cash","story":"Share this article Ms Clarke added: \u0027If they have not got a card unfortunately we can\u0027t give them the goods.

For it to be a successful night, remember it’s all in the planning ... Since coronavirus has shrunk our social spheres, intimate garden parties have become something of a trend. Thanks to street-wide WhatsApp chats and local volunteer groups, eclectic new friendships have been forged – and as the weather’s improved, online quizzes with distant relatives have segued into alfresco drinks with new and nearby friends.While we’re all being urged to stay alert, the easing of lockdown rules means we can meet up with more of our friends. Outside the permitted bubbles in each area, the 2-metre rule remains in place in Scotland and Wales, while iniduals in England and Northern Ireland must stay at least 1 metre apart.But groups of friends can now gather together outside – any sized group from up to two households can meet in Wales up to six people from different households in England, with no limit on people from two different households in Northern Ireland, groups of up to 30 people can meet and in Scotland, up to 15 people from up to five different households can meet outside per day – all while keeping a distance.All of which means summer isn’t cancelled, it just looks somewhat different to how we imagined – but we can still get ready to brush up on our barbecuing and hosting skills.Now it’s trickier to go to the corner shop for extras, planning is of the essence. Here are our tips for hosting the perfect post-lockdown barbecue, and enjoying a safely sociable summer.Be considerateThe first rule of new-normal socialising is to be respectful of everyone’s boundaries. You might not mind sharing food with your guests, but others might be more anxious. Find out what everyone’s comfortable with before you plan your party – and if one of your friends would prefer to bring their own food, be prepared to be OK with that.Shop smartThanks to socially distanced shopping, the etiquette of putting on a barbecue has changed, too – it’s now perfectly reasonable to ask people to bring their own food or drink if they want something specific. Meanwhile, make sure you provide enough basics, to avoid a dash to the shops, mask in hand. You can find barbecue calculators online that will tell you how much meat, veg, side dishes and drink to buy depending on the number of people attending.Buy localWhile your online shop is ideal for stocking up on basics, a barbecue is the perfect excuse to explore your local area and uncover some hidden foodie gems. From artisan ciabatta rolls and locally produced meats, to small-batch chutneys, cheeses and ale, it’s a great time to support the independent stores reopening after lockdown. As well as boosting the economy, buying locally sourced produce keeps your carbon footprint clean, too.Stock up on masksJust as you’d make sure a guest didn’t drive home after a few drinks, protecting them if they have to get a cab or public transport home is equally thoughtful. Buy some masks to hand out to anyone who might suddenly need one at the end of the evening.Play it safeYou can’t control the weather – but you can make sure staying safe feels like a natural part of the party, rather than a chore. Put out plenty of hand sanitisers and wipes for guests, hand out glasses marked with their names, and hang 2-metre-long strips of bunting as a visual reminder not to mingle too closely. Spacing out your garden furniture around a central hub, such as a fire pit, will also help remind people to keep a distance without dampening the atmosphere.Create a signature dishWith more of us cooking at home than ever, it’s worth taking the time to develop a dish that will really wow your guests. Whether it’s making a lip-smacking vegan pulled “pork” (try BOSH’s for inspiration) or perfecting an all-American regional burger (make George Motz your go-to for recipes), head to your local butcher or farmers’ market, and start planning a grill everyone will remember for the right reasons.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Biographer AN Wilson shares his favourite booksThe novels are unlike any other writer’s. People have likened them to poems, to visions, to pantomime, and they are all these things. If you want to see how different he was to all his contemporaries, just try to imagine George Eliot or Thackeray or the Brontë sisters doing those reading tours, when thousands of people, the poor in multitudes, came to hear him. Nothing like it had been seen since John Wesley’s preaching tours.There have been thousands of books on Dickens. I wanted, nevertheless, in The Mystery of Charles Dickens to set down some of my lifelong obsession with his work. One thing I wanted to winkle out, if I could, was the relationship between the life and the work. Something much more complicated was going on than with most novelists, all of whom take versions of their own lives and turn them into fiction. At a much deeper level than most, Dickens was confronting his own demons – the wretched childhood, the appalling relations with women – and turning them into melodrama, tragedy, farce, burlesque. That sense we all flickeringly retain of our childhood self watching the behaviour of the baffling and often scary grownups – that sense in him was hyper-developed, and it is what turbocharged the books.1. Selected Journalism 1850-1870 (edited by David Pascoe) It might seem paradoxical to start my list with the journalism, but Dickens began as a journalist and he never stopped being one. While pursuing a life as a prolific novelist, tireless charity worker, fairly frequent actor, Dickens kept up weekly journalism, and edited two of his own periodicals, Household Words and All the Year Round. Try reading A Nightly Scene in London from 1856, in which Dickens takes us to Whitechapel, where he finds five bundles of old rags thrown down by the walls of the workhouse. The bundles turn out to be women, of course. One of his strongest pieces. Or read Lying Awake, the justly famous account of the joint public hanging of the Mannings, a married pair of murderers.2. Sketches By BozAgain, journalism, but journalism morphing into the fiction. He took the name Boz from his brother Augustus’s nickname. Published the year before Victoria became queen, and written when he was in his early 20s, it is so vivid, so warm, so comic, so passionate. London Recreations, whose title is self-explanatory, is not merely descriptive. It contains that hatred of busybodydom and evangelical humbug that burst out in a more mature essay for Household Words, The Great Baby – the baby being the public, patronised by Those Who Know Best.3. American Notes A better account of the young Dickens’s take on the US than the one novel I’d deem a failure, Martin Chuzzlewit. He visited America’s prisons, saw its great landscapes, appreciated its hospitality and open-heartedness. But he could not stick the evangelical Christianity. “Wherever religion is resorted to, as a strong drink, and as an escape from the dull monotonous round of home, those of its ministers who pepper the highest will be surest to please. They who strew the Eternal Path with the greatest amount of brimstone, and who most ruthlessly tread down the flowers and leaves that grow by the wayside, will be voted the most righteous”.4. A Christmas Carol In many ways this, the most famous of all his books, is his best. Christmas was central to his world-vision that simply trying to be a little kinder to one another both as iniduals and as a society might be an experiment worth trying. If, reading these words, you have never tried a book by Dickens, I’d recommend starting with the famous story of how Scrooge was converted from a belief in money and power into someone who saw the power of love. The fact that it is set in the form of a fairytale is a good preparation for the longer fiction all of which, at its most successful, possesses some of the power of such stories.5. David CopperfieldHis own personal favourite among the novels. A book that can make me – and millions of others – weep and laugh out loud, often on the same page. A sort of autobiography, but one in which all his family have been expunged. David’s father is dead before the book begins, his mother dies when he is still very young. And unlike Dickens, David has no siblings. The awful woes and cruelties for which in real life he blamed his parents are the fault of the wicked stepfather Mr Murdstone. This book has some of Dickens’s finest characters – Mr Dick, Mr Micawber, Betsey Trotwood – and, in the storm that engulfs the Suffolk coast, one of his most powerful descriptions of nature.6. Great ExpectationsIf Copperfield was a rather benign version of his autobiography, here he takes the gloves off. The person he is beating up is himself. Pip believes he has inherited wealth from the sinister Miss Havisham, the rich woman of Rochester, whereas in fact the source of his wealth is the convict, Magwitch, to whom as a child Pip had shown kindness. The mistake which Pip finds so shattering reveals, to him and to us, all his skewed values, all his cult of wealth and status. Technically the most flawless of the fictions, and one that makes for truly uncomfortable reading.7. Little DorritIn Copperfield, Dickens’s improvident father was depicted in the benign, comical figure of Mr Micawber, whose spells in the debtors’ gaol are a kind of joke. In Little Dorrit, the actual experience of Mr Dickens senior in the Marshalsea prison fed into one the most powerful of all his mature works. Equally terrible, presumably because it was unconscious on Dickens’s part, is his expression of profound mother-hatred in the figure of Mrs Clennam, the power-mad businesswoman exercising control from the darkened sick-room of her tottering house. An amazing masterpiece. 8. Bleak HouseAnother great masterpiece. One of the things that overpowered me, as I reread and reread Dickens in preparation for my book, was how he confronted and analysed the sheer beastliness of the 19th century. In this book, famously, he satirised the slow, corrupt processes of the law and the high court of Chancery, but really, when you read of the death of Little Jo the Crossing Sweeper or listen to the slow drip-drip-drip of boredom and rain at the aristocrat’s house, or work out the tangles of the plot through the life and death of society solicitor Mr Tulkinghorn, you realise that it is the 19th century itself on trial, swathed, like London in November, in fogs of cruelty .9. The Old Curiosity ShopA relatively early one, and very like a fairytale or a panto. It contains some of his most vivid characters, not least Mr Quilp, a furious, crazy self-projection, which tells you much more about Dickens than does the rather vapid self-portrait in Copperfield. Quilp’s cruelty to his wife is, we now realise, all too true a portrait of his own behaviour as a husband to his harmless wife. The relationship between Little Nell and her gambling-addict grandfather, and their attempt to escape Quilp, leads us on a journey out of London, with vivid landscape and cityscape pictures of the nightmare that was Victorian England. One of his best.10. The Mystery of Edwin DroodIn the book he did not live to finish, he returns to the Rochester of his boyhood. It seems to be very VERY different from the others, not least because, as far as we can judge from remarks he made to friends and family, he intended to end it with a monologue by a convicted murderer who had committed his crime while under the influence of opium. But there are many theories about who killed Edwin Drood, or, indeed, whether he was killed. The book shows signs of Dickens’s weak health, and some of the chapters are as dead as anything he wrote. But there is a flare of genius, like the glory of sunset, in the pages he penned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28fae30f0fd5a89d2ba65285feb8bf6dac0180df/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=445c3ee8e05e75559332d4e3b55804fa","title":"aldi supermarket chain ready to take on 1200 new employees in uk","story":"Supermarket chain plans to open average of one new store a week before ChristmasAldi is to hire 1,200 new employees during the rest of this year, in a rare scrap of good news for jobseekers as the coronavirus pandemic forces many UK businesses to shed staff. The supermarket chain, which along with fellow German chain Lidl have been the fastest-growing UK supermarkets in recent years, plans to open an average of one new store a week between now and Christmas.“As much as the disruption of the past few months has been challenging, it has also reminded us that there are still hundreds of towns across the UK where shoppers don’t have access to Aldi’s award winning quality products and unbeatable prices,” said Giles Hurley, Aldi UK’s chief executive.“To continue doing this and meet our goals of making Aldi accessible to even more shoppers, we will need thousands more amazing colleagues across the country.

A summer of camping, cagoules and beach picnics eaten stoically behind a windbreak beckons for many, now that ministers are finally spelling out that any foreign travel in a pandemic is a gamble. And while my heart goes out to anyone whose Spanish holiday just went up in smoke or whose job in tourism now hangs in the balance, if nothing else, a stay-at-home summer is a chance to appreciate the beauty of what was always on our doorstep. The pandemic is shrinking horizons even faster and more bewilderingly than globalisation once expanded them. The question is whether that will have consequences well beyond the holidays.Could living, socialising and generally sticking rather closer to home than we have been used to become not a bug but a deliberate feature of a post-pandemic world? This idea lies at the heart of the 15-minute city movement, which argues for cutting out unnecessary car journeys and tackling climate change by ensuring city dwellers can work, shop, get the kids to school, hang out in the park and generally manage their everyday lives all within 15 minutes’ walk or cycle from their front doors. Melbourne has been experimenting with something similar for years now, while in Paris the pursuit of la ville du quart d’heure was a feature of mayor Anne Hidalgo’s re-election campaign last month. Variations of the same idea have emerged in cities from Ottawa to Detroit.But it’s the hunkered-down mood brought on by living with coronavirus that has really sparked interest in the idea of cities as a string of self-sufficient neighbourhoods, each with its own thriving high streets, affordable housing, jobs, green spaces and even communal vegetable gardens. The idea resonates with commuters, who have learned to love working from home during the pandemic, but also with people who liked getting to know their neighbours better in lockdown or who feel a new rush of loyalty towards local shops that sustained them through the worst. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has already signed up to a post-Covid-19 recovery strategy devised by the C40 group of city mayors worldwide, which includes 15-minute cities among its ideas. Even Boris Johnson’s new anti-obesity drive, with its emphasis on walking and cycling more, nods in the same direction, albeit for different reasons.It’s not about confining people to cramped, parochial lives – city dwellers will always be drawn to wherever the action is – and nor is it as twee as it may sound. If you live in villagey Dulwich or Didsbury, then you already have the artisan deli, the leafy park and the cafes full of freelancers hunched over laptops, which means a true 15-minute strategy would focus more on regenerating the grittier neighbourhoods lacking so much as a decent supermarket. Levelling up, you might call it. Yet instead the prime minister pleads with commuters to pick up the threads of their old lives, traipsing back to their city centre offices to help save jobs in Upper Crust or Pret a Manger.To be fair, the government has good reason to fear the economic consequences of an exodus from city centres. The middle-class fantasy of never having to go back to the office too often ignores the consequences for lower paid workers whose jobs relied on servicing these now unwanted commuter lifestyles. It’s not just coffee and sandwich shops: quit an office-based job, and you save on everything from suits to train tickets, childcare to drinks out after work. Multiply those inidual cutbacks thousands of time over and there must be consequences, not just for jobs but for public services. (How long would some bus and train routes around the country stay viable, stripped of rush-hour passengers?) But for as long as fear of infection lingers, Downing Street is fighting an uphill battle. It should be thinking instead about harnessing the new localism for the good of the planet, while helping businesses follow the money back out to the suburbs and market towns.For after months with nothing to spend it on, many higher earners have cash burning a hole in their pockets. The difference is, they’ll be drawn to spending it on services that go with the grain of their changed lives: hub workspaces, where lonely home workers can rent a desk alongside others, or cosy neighbourhood joints that make them feel comfortable about going out to eat again. They say all politics is local. Doing business in a post-Covid-19 world may depend on understanding how much of life now is, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd25aeaa1c301b235e2c6cfef6ace855ac395b47/0_190_4629_2777/master/4629.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=5142465afeaf3de27c358113da735186","title":"rebuild the left labour leadership politics change","story":"If politics seems to offer little hope for society, try engaging with transformative changes unfolding in our communitiesPolitics is a roller-coaster, with ups and downs now coming at a dizzying speed. An idea, a meme or a video shared across the globe can spark upheaval. A brutal cop is caught on camera in Minneapolis, and within days a global movement for racial justice sweeps across the world.In this political maelstrom people feel lost, disorientated. Hopes for change are raised fast but dashed quickly. Take reactions to coronavirus. Already the left appears to be suffering a post-crisis comedown. At first, the pandemic seemed like a political turning point. There were the initial promises of collective action, the rush of mutual aid, the weekly applause for the NHS and its echoes of the blitz spirit. Even the current Conservative government turned on the spending taps.And then came the Dominic Cummings scandal. Many smelt blood, hoping his fall would bring the government down. That Cummings stayed in post took the wind from the left’s sails. Back in the real world, the Tories waited it out – because they could. While the left prays, the right plans – to refashion Whitehall, to own big spending while retaining an air of economic competence, to remake global relations in a post-Brexit world. They’ll do anything and everything to win.Along the way, Labour has tried Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband, Jeremy Corbyn, and now Keir Starmer. But without practicing deep-rooted change, relying on a single leader to save the party is a displacement activity. It’s time to take a long breath and rethink. We have four years to do so. The politics of transformative change, even in this accelerated moment, takes time and needs to be sustained with deep roots.What are these deep roots? The building blocks of transformative change are fivefold. First, a shared and persuasive vision of a good society and good life a policy programme that will get us there an electoral strategy of parties and groups that share this vision and benefit from the programme connecting with emergent and energetic forces in society that prefigure that good society and can help sustain it and, finally, a political culture of pluralism and intense collaboration that can harness and direct the latent, disparate potential lying all around us.Let’s take an example. In 1945, Labour didn’t transform the country solely because it won a big majority. This electoral win was necessary, but not sufficient for change. After the experience of the second world war, ideas were at play that would transform society. John Maynard Keynes and William Beveridge supplied the policies, but even deeper forces were at work. The collective experience of the war and the memories of the depression that preceded it contributed to the culture of determined renewal that defined that era. The Fordist systems of administration that ran the factories, Whitehall and the army, together with unions and the looming existential threat that the Soviet Union posed to western capitalism, sealed the postwar settlement.What equivalent experiences and forces can the left draw on now? Austerity and inequality are the evils to be banished pandemics and climate breakdown the universal dangers to be avoided. People cherish time from work, air they can breathe, care and security. We have motive enough, what we lack is means. It’s the “how” of change we must fathom, not just the “what”. But that “how” is emerging.In the Steven Spielberg’s 1977 sci-fi classic Close Encounters of Third Kind, seemingly disconnected characters start drawing the same mountain-like shape. Something big is connecting them. Today, in every place and every sector, a new and shared ethos is connecting us. People are shaping deep relationships of trust, collaboration and participation. If neither the free market nor Fordist factories set people free, then as networked active citizens, they’re finding new collective ways to realise their humanity.Look at the Manifesto for Collaboration, or the Tiny House movement starting to spring up across the UK. Watch what more radical local governments are doing in places such as Camden and Barking and Dagenham, in London, to Manchester and North of Tyne (Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland). The critical point in this hive of activity is not just that collaboration is morally right. It’s that engagement and negotiation are increasingly efficient. In the complex opportunities and challenges we face, the cybernetics pioneer Ross Ashby’s Law of Requisite Variety rules: any governing body must be at least as complex as the body it seeks to govern. Efficacy today demands not simplistic control or competition, but complex collaboration.This new thinking and practice is brought into timely focus in Garden Mind, by Sue Goss, a new publication from Compass. Goss is a system change practitioner who argues that gardening – with its patient, tending and adaptive style – is a good analogy for what should replace the clunky but still dominant “machine mind” that has long defined the role of the state. We’re no longer cogs in a wheel but curators in an ecosystem that we shape, and which shapes us in turn.But gardening takes time. “Great works are performed”, wrote Samuel Johnson, “not by brute strength but through perseverance.” Change isn’t just coming – it’s already here. We need to see it, seed more of it, connect to it and persevere.• Neal Lawson is a director of the centre-left pressure group Compass"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa275fdd7a5e751012e8b24cafcb535f70d26c4/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfac8b92af2578c4b8772183858db29d","title":"the guardian view on covid 19s resurgence we can make ourselves safer","story":"The picture in Europe and further afield is grim. But we must not resign ourselves to a large-scale recurrence of coronavirus Is the brief respite over? In England, and other European nations hit hard by coronavirus, bars and cafes have reopened, and people have begun to fly abroad again for holidays. Guests have gathered for weddings. Babies have met their grandparents for the first time.Though many remain wary, the government’s keenness to get back to business has encouraged a dangerous sense of complacency some are increasingly casual in following the rules. Less than two weeks ago, Boris Johnson made the remarkable suggestion that there could be a “return to normality” by Christmas, with even distancing requirements dropped. Now the prime minister has warned there are signs of a second wave in Europe. Spain’s sharp rise in cases has already prompted England to reimpose quarantine for returning travellers it may soon do so for Belgium, Luxembourg and Croatia. Niall Dickson, who heads the NHS Confederation – representing NHS leaders – has told MPs that managers are very worried about a second spike, perhaps before winter, citing exhausted staff and the need to rebuild other services.Hong Kong, which has kept a relatively tight lid on infections until now, is on the verge of a large-scale community outbreak, according to its chief executive, which could lead to the collapse of the hospital system. Vietnam – which has so far recorded no deaths – reported its first case for three months at the weekend now it is bracing for a surge after dozens more in multiple locations.Others have seen no pause. The US reopening was vastly premature – as 4 million confirmed cases and a death toll of 150,000 attest. In India and Brazil, the virus is flourishing. Though some poorer countries have put wealthy nations to shame with exemplary initial responses, coronavirus will wreak its most devastating damage in communities with overcrowded conditions, poor sanitation and healthcare, malnutrition and no social safety net.The global picture underscores that we are not, in truth, facing a new wave, but a continuation or resurgence: the pandemic is “one big wave”, says World Health Organization spokesperson Margaret Harris. But she also made it clear that, while it might be accelerating, it is not an inexorable force sweeping all before it. It can and must be flattened.Another worldwide lockdown is neither possible nor desirable, given its costs. But the alternative is not resignation, abandoning the most vulnerable to take their chances. It is for governments to redouble efforts. They must work together, and encourage their citizens to pull together.One hope is that governments and communities are better prepared for a resurgence thanks to the test and trace strategies they have developed, and increased public awareness of how to reduce the risk of infection. Another is that they are learning from what they and others got wrong the first time round. The UK’s failure to protect care homes saw them “thrown to the wolves”, in the words of the public accounts committee. In Hong Kong, the president of the medical association has criticised the high level of exemptions from quarantine.But if Mr Johnson is as concerned as he says, it is baffling that the government wants to urge people who can work remotely back into workplaces, and is still encouraging people to book holidays. Two epidemiologists have suggested the UK could eliminate coronavirus if it stops overseas tourism. The threat of a resurgence is all the more reason for England and Wales to seriously consider the Independent Sage group’s “Zero Covid” approach, already adopted by Scotland and Northern Ireland.With no vaccine yet available, a sensible government would pause the relaxation of restrictions while it takes stock, and discourage people from holidaying abroad as cases grow. It would clarify guidelines to make them more understandable, and throw itself into effective social media campaigns to remind people of the difference that mask wearing, proper distancing and handwashing make. Meanwhile, it would ensure that it has adequate supplies of protective gear, medical equipment and the necessary medicines. Iniduals, too, must do their part by following official advice. England should have been better prepared for coronavirus to hit in spring. It has no excuses this time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd58a4b127da5e72696518161d8a9a974ef171b/0_523_6234_3740/master/6234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89fad98c6b0a2bc5abdc8a4c06875f3d","title":"spuds you like potato photographer of the year in pictures","story":"The inaugural Potato Photographer of the Year prize has gone to a potato getting a lockdown haircut.

It said it will sell its final holdings in BHP by 3 August.Nest will also seek to reduce its carbon-intensive holdings, such as with the traditional oil giants, while investing more money in renewable energy infrastructure.The fund’s chief investment officer, Mark Fawcett, said Nest was sending a strong and clear message about the seriousness of climate change.“Just like coronavirus, climate change poses serious risks to both our savers and their investments,” Fawcett said. “It has the potential to cause catastrophic damage and completely disrupt our way of life. No one wants to save throughout their life to retire into a world devastated by climate change.“As the world’s economy slowly recovers from coronavirus, we want to ensure this recovery is a green one. We have a unique opportunity to support sustainable growth and transition towards a low-carbon economy.”Nest still has relatively little money under management – around £12.2bn – but it is expected to become a mammoth player in the industry as the savings from millions of workers pour into its coffers in the coming decades.Nest is hesitant about describing its new policy as a full estment programme. It said it remained interested in oil companies that were transitioning from carbon-based fuels to green energy and renewable technology and that it would use its muscle to challenge them and push for stricter targets.Oil and gas companies remain the biggest hurdle for “keep it in the ground” campaigners, with most pension funds reluctant to fully est. In June, the £68bn Universities Superannuation Scheme said it would est from coal investments after years of intensive lobbying, but retain oil and gas investments.Campaigners welcomed Nest’s new climate policy and said it was likely to prompt better behaviour at other funds. Lauren Peacock of ShareAction said: “We hope it will encourage other pension schemes to up their ambition … Nest is setting clear expectations for those most responsible for the climate emergency and demonstrating the power of pensions to move them along a more sustainable path.”But its decision to est from the dirtiest polluters and reduce holdings elsewhere is in contrast to arguments set out by Opperman. The minister publicly called on pension trustees to keep hold of fossil fuel assets in order to “nudge, cajole or vote” polluting companies towards sustainable business practises.In a blogpost, first published by the Daily , he said that holding fossil fuel assets could be a “spring board to real change” and that simply selling them to others would be counterproductive.Opperman’s position provoked an open letter from more than 60 MPs, NGO bosses and faith leaders who criticised the minister’s “anti-estment stance” and warned that urging companies to remain invested in polluting companies contradicted government guidance set in April this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e66e24735629c4f7e80585adccdfda34ac7e7f3/82_4_3289_1974/master/3289.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a6e0d7d21c1498bf69826c9acff2946b","title":"how to make hummus recipe felicity cloake","story":"How to make the nation’s favourite dip with just a few store-cupboard ingredientsRemember the great hummus crisis of 2017, when the country went into meltdown over a temporary shortage of chickpea puree? Ah, they were happy days … Anyway, now the problem is more likely to be that you can’t face going to the shops to buy hummus, but the solution is the same: if you’ve got the ingredients, make your own.Prep 10 min, plus soakingCook Zero to 2 hr+, depending on the chickpeasServes 4200g dried chickpeas, or 1 x 400g tin or jar (see step 1)1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda (optional)3 garlic cloves, or to taste6 tbsp tahiniJuice of 1 lemon, or more to taste1 generous pinch ground cuminFine salt, to tasteExtra-virgin olive oil, to topIf you’re using dried chickpeas, which is my preference, because I think they have a better flavour, put them in a large bowl and cover with twice the volume of cold water.If you’re using a tin, skip straight to step four – the jarred Spanish kind are pricey, but their buttery texture makes it worth it if you can run to the expense.Stir in a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda, if using, and leave to soak for 24 hours – this will help the chickpeas soften more quickly, and give the finished hummus a creamier consistency, but if you don’t have it available, or really don’t like the flavour even in small amounts, leave it out.Drain and rinse the chickpeas, put them in a large pan with the remaining bicarb and cover again with cold water. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and leave to simmer gently until tender, adding more water if necessary – this will probably take a couple of hours, depending on the age of the chickpeas they should be easy to crush, but not falling apart.Leave the chickpeas to cool in the cooking liquid, then drain well, reserving the water. If using tinned or jarred chickpeas, drain them, and likewise keep their liquid. Set aside a spoonful of the chickpeas to use as a garnish. If you’d like a really silky end product, remove the papery skins (which should be falling off by this point anyway), by rubbing the chickpeas between your fingers it’s a fiddly job, true, but I think well worth it.Peel and crush the garlic (three cloves are my preference for this amount of chickpeas, but you may wish to add more, or less, depending on your tolerance for raw garlic), and put half of it in a small bowl.Stir in the tahini and half the lemon juice, to make a stiff paste, then gradually beat in just enough of the reserved chickpea water to loosen it to a pourable liquid consistency.Put this and the drained chickpeas in a food processor (or, if you’re using a stick blender, a sturdy bowl if you don’t have either, you can use a pestle and mortar to crush the chickpeas in batches, provided you have the time and patience – though you’ll need then to press it through a sieve to get the mix to the right texture.Blitz the chickpeas until really smooth, then add the cumin, a good pinch of salt and the rest of the garlic. With the motor still running, drizzle in enough of the reserved cooking water to get the desired consistency – the hummus should hold its shape, but not be heavy or claggy. Taste and add more salt, lemon or garlic, if you think it needs it.Spoon the hummus into a serving bowl and then pour a little olive oil around the side. Finish by scattering the reserved chickpeas in the centre you could also add a sprinkle of sesame seeds, za’atar, sumac or smoked paprika, if you fancy it, or indeed some fresh herbs such as finely chopped coriander or mint.Purists may be horrified, but hummus is a very versatile base. Add pureed cooked beetroot or other vegetables (roast red peppers or squash are particularly nice), or swap some of the chickpeas for other beans or pulses, if you prefer. Homemade (or, indeed, shop-bought) hummus is the perfect home for that almost empty jar of harissa or the last handful of frozen peas, so be creative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2502a160c8289869466ffe3ec5c14307eff4457/0_0_1575_945/master/1575.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6c16e163459aa57367dbc40dd68e0ab7","title":"brentford swansea city championship play off semi final second leg match report","story":"A night for moving on. For shedding baggage and laying the past to rest. On the night Brentford said their farewells to Griffin Park, they came closer to top-flight football than they have done at any point since 1947.They did so with a sparkling modern brand of football quite at odds with the weathered girders and sardine seats of their old home.Fulham or Cardiff lie in wait at a deserted Wembley next Tuesday, the final fixture in this strangest of seasons, and if Brentford are to break their hoodoo of eight successive play-off failures they can ask for few better platforms.Few better front threes than Saïd Benrahma, Ollie Watkins and Bryan Mbeumo. Few better midfield conductors than Mathias Jensen. Few better managers than Thomas Frank, who has forced Brentford to dream big, to write a new chapter in a cherished history.Of course, breaking into the world’s richest league requires more than a healthy sense of predestination. You need to suffer and you need to sweat, and on a warm evening both teams played their part in an arrestingly physical encounter. Frank had promised in the buildup that he would carry his exhausted players off the pitch at the end if necessary, and in a stunning, full-throttle opening 15 minutes that turned the tie on its head, his team were as good as his word.It began, as so many of Brentford’s moves do, from the very back: the goalkeeper David Raya finding Jensen, the Denmark under-21 midfielder on the fringes of the senior national team. All night Jensen pulled the strings, pulled Swansea this way and that, and here he played the sort of defence-splitting pass – fully 60 yards, all along the ground, straight down the middle – that you wanted to watch again and again. A pass with its own impossible choreography, right down to the perfectly timed run of Watkins, who finished with an assassin’s cool for his 26th goal of the season.Perhaps Swansea were a little concussed by the brutal, geometric coldness of that goal. Certainly that would explain the momentary loss of defensive shape that allowed Benrahma to advance to the edge of their area just moments later.As Swansea’s midfield collapsed on to the back three like a boxer sinking into the deadly embrace of the ropes, Benrahma had all the time in the world to flop a delicious cross on to the head of Emiliano Marcondes. In the space of four minutes, Brentford were 2-0 up and Swansea’s one-goal cushion had turned into an ejector seat.It could have been worse for them. Benrahma was beginning to come into the game, enjoying a string of decent openings, and at one point clattering the inside of the post after a magical little exchange with Jensen. Swansea’s best chance came through Conor Gallagher, and as half-time approached they had just about managed to stem the bleeding.But within barely a minute of the restart, Brentford had hit them again: Jensen again, releasing Rico Henry (reprieved from suspension after being sent off in the first leg), crossing for Mbeumo to volley home with authority and swagger.Now, as Swansea threw themselves into one last effort, Brentford’s defence would step up. Raya made a wonderful save from Connor Roberts. Christian Norgaard made two or three crucial clearances in a row. And for all the miles in the legs, the 101 matches these two sides had already dragged themselves through this season, remarkably the final stages of the game were just as intense and spellbinding as the first. Rhian Brewster threatened a Swansea comeback, with 12 minutes remaining, making the most of defensive indecision from Pontus JanssonBut as the six minutes of injury time leaked away, as Swansea plugged away to little effect, Brentford seemed to strengthen, not weaken. Full-time came like a benediction, a sweet catharsis not just for those in the ground but for the untold thousands of Brentford fans who would rather have been watching in person, not through a screen.There is talk of a proper farewell for the old place at some point, perhaps a socially distanced reception, even an exhibition game. But in a sense, this was the perfect way for it to end. The stands will soon be houses.A gleaming new chapel awaits just one stop up the line at Kew Bridge. Time, in more senses than one, to take the next step."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90007902e3da0c022168c5d7f9e327a88bc641c1/106_307_1568_940/master/1568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=917b5917faef4a6830176da6596fa605","title":"manchester city agree terms with 25m ferran torres of valencia","story":"Manchester City have agreed a deal to sign Ferran Torres from Valencia for £24.5m (€27m) plus add-ons after successful talks on Wednesday.Pep Guardiola, having sanctioned the sale of Leroy Sané to Bayern Munich after the Germany forward refused a new contract, targeted Torres to add to his attacking options after an impressive season in which the 20-year-old became Valencia’s youngest goalscorer in the Champions League.Torres has agreed personal terms with City on a contract until 2025 and is understood to be keen on working with Guardiola. Despite Valencia initially demanding €45m for a player who in November became the youngest in their history to play 50 La Liga games, they have accepted a lower bid with significant add-ons given he has only one year left on his deal.City are also in the market for central defenders and have held talks with Bournemouth over Nathan Aké.

Never before have fans held such influence – just consider the change they could enact if they used itAs implausible and preposterous as it may be, let’s imagine a post Covid-19 world where football fans are finally allowed back into Premier League grounds but elect en masse not to go. Not because home drinking, tedious family Zoom quizzes and banana bread baking have eclipsed the sport in popularity, but because after months spent locked out of stadiums match-going supporters have realised the importance of their role cannot be overstated and unilaterally opt to stay away until certain conditions are met.Even before a ball has been kicked it is reasonably safe to assume that Saturday’s FA Cup final will be the worst of all time. A traditionally grand occasion that will be memorable for all the wrong and weirdest of reasons, the Football Association’s showpiece event has been reduced to little more than a surreal meander through the motions this season, in order to fulfil contractual obligations and keep the financial and football record books up to date.Carnations may well adorn lapels, there will be half-hearted pre-match smoke and mirrors, and Arsenal or Chelsea will prevail. The trophy will be handed over and hoisted skywards following an awkward presentation soundtracked by a pyrotechnic display designed to ert global attention from the depressingly bare look of the cavernous empty and iconic stadium in which one of the most famous games in world football has just been played.Contested to the sound of no hands clapping or fans chanting, the game itself may well be a classic but the occasion will be uncharacteristically desolate and grim. It will still matter of course it will. For all its neatness as a soundbite, the notion that football without fans is nothing is just not true and a Cup final played with nobody in attendance is, at least for those on the pitch, marginally better than no Cup final at all.Every day all over the world, footballers of all ages, shapes, sizes, levels of ability and fitness gather to play their own cup finals without an audience for their own amusement and invariably have a fine time. Whether it’s on pitches, indoor and outdoor courts, gymnasiums, back gardens and yards, waste ground, scrubland, these finals are generally played wherever there’s room for one enthusiast or more to chase a rolling, bouncing ball. But for the presence of those playing, these locations would more often than not be forlorn, empty and unattended, demonstrating that football without fans is generally a very healthy, popular and largely beneficial use of the players’ time.It is not widely known but the sum total of no spectators were in attendance to witness the best goal ever scored. An Exocet header from outside the penalty area – or where the penalty area would have been if the pitch had been marked – the ball was fumbled on to the inside of the upright by a butterfingered schoolboy nicknamed Beaver before bouncing over the goalline that also wasn’t there. The young goalkeeper’s clumsy intervention was not enough to keep the ball out but probably prevented the silence from the sidelines that greeted the stunning effort being broken by the satisfying sound of a rippling goal net. I say probably, because in the absence of anything so glamorous as an actual goal net it was impossible to tell.In the absence of applause or pleasing sound effects, the scorer was forced to settle for the usual congratulatory pats on the head and boots up the arse from a few surprised teammates before a bell went and arguably the most insignificant kickabout in the history of the sport came to an end. Except it wasn’t completely insignificant because more than 30 years later I still recall that wonderful header I scored with fondness and crystal clarity. Far more importantly, it is finally a matter of public record.The 15-year-old me had long since made peace with the fact he would never score in an FA Cup final but on Saturday somebody else who dreamed of doing so as a child almost certainly will. Technically, achieving such a milestone in front of 90,000 unoccupied and utterly indifferent seats will not render their accomplishment any less significant, except it almost certainly will.Top-level football without fans is not nothing but it has become abundantly clear in recent weeks it is little more than a pale imitation of itself. The fact that this faded, facsimile, fan-free football is a sterile, anodyne and largely pointless pursuit will not have gone unnoticed by the grasping clubs, governing bodies and broadcasting companies who rely on the sport and those who watch it for their billions. Never before have football fans enjoyed such influence, although they will almost inevitably choose not to use it.Imagine if they did. Imagine a scenario where they mobilised and decided enough is enough. One in which, upon being welcomed back into their vast and long-vacant enormo-domes in the coming months, they chose instead to stay away subject to a list of not entirely unreasonable demands being met.Much cheaper tickets. No more paywalls, or at the very least a significant reduction in TV subscriptions, which would then be capped. An end to club gouging, the disturbing recent proliferation of gambling advertising and the rescheduling of matches for the benefit of armchair viewers at the expense of matchgoing fans. A guaranteed and substantial trickle-down redistribution of wealth from the top of the game to grassroots that, if needs be, comes out of the pockets of players, agents and owners who earn more money than any one person could possibly need. And they’re just a few off the top of the collective head for starters.In his illuminating book Can We Have Our Football Back?, published long before lockdown, John Nicholson, the world’s most idealistic football writer, insists repeatedly that fans have always had the power. There may never be a better time to wield it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72d2755623a308154bd355febec8b8d3a8fc0b55/0_198_3139_1883/master/3139.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cd3d51407222d42ea861b8f53818753","title":"brentford v swansea championship play off semi final second leg live","story":"Farewell Griffin Park, hello Wembley!

Mbeumo provided a worthy finish, leaning back and guiding a crisp volley into the net from 10 yards. 46 min: Swansea substitutions: Cabango and Dhanda on, Van der Hoorn and Fulton off.Brentford started brilliantly, overturning their first-leg deficit in a jiffy. For a while they looked set to blow Swansea apart but the Welsh side rallied in the final 15 minutes of the half and began pass the ball around confidently in the opposing half. Swansea, then, will be reasonably satisfied to be still very much in this tie. Both team look capable of scoring. This is far from over.42 min: A Swansea move breaks down ... and suddenly Brentford are bearing down on goal! Benrahma feeds Mbeumo, who runs into the right-hand side of the box ... Van der Hoorn closes in on him ... and the striker fails to get off a shot, instead confusing himself as he decides whether to square the ball or open fire. He ends up running the ball out of play.

Some surrogates are now being asked to provide additional care in the interim.Parents are desperate to get to their children and avoid being potentially cut off from them, as a controversial criminal investigation against doctors spreads fear in the surrogacy industry, which is legal in Russia.“This is an urgent problem,” said Irina Kirkora, the deputy head of the Kremlin’s advisory council on human rights.Kirkora estimated that as many as 1,000 births to foreign parents may have occurred since February, based on a tallying of clinics in Russia catering to international surrogacy. An employee of a company in St Petersburg that provides surrogacy services estimated that the number was at least 600.“These are children that are growing up every day. They need their parents,” said Kirkora.Paid surrogacy is only allowed in a few countries around the world, including Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and some states in the US. The discovery of dozens of stranded babies at a Ukrainian surrogate company in May drew attention to how Covid-19 had disrupted the industry.James and Ling*, a British-Chinese couple from Shanghai, are expecting a baby girl in the next few days. The surrogate has already been admitted to hospital in Moscow.For the couple, the bureaucratic struggle to arrive in time for their daughter’s birth caps years of effort to have a child, from unsuccessful attempts to conceive, to infertility treatment, then medical screenings for surrogacy, two trips to Moscow to provide sperm and eggs for in vitro fertilisation, and then several failed implantations in a surrogate mother’s womb before a successful pregnancy was achieved late last year.Now they are faced with a closed border and often contradictory information about how to get in to Russia.“We are trying to be adult about it,” said Ling, who along with her husband has approached Russian, Chinese, and UK officials to try to get a Russian entry visa. “But we have been patient for so many months. It is time for us to go full speed.”Ling said that because she and her husband faced infertility problems after 35, they decided that surrogacy was “a very good solution for us, if we approach it in the right way”.They’ve collected medical records and news clippings to chart their daughter’s development – and their diplomatic battle to reach her – to show her when she is older. “We want to provide our daughter a history she is proud of. That’s our philosophy,” said Ling.They are soon to join an estimated 180 families in China who have had children born to surrogates in Russia since February. Other families are in Singapore, France, the Philippines, Argentina and Australia, said Kirkora.In a Chinese WeChat group with 150 members, other families have expressed pain and shame at missing the first months of their children’s lives.In video testimonials seen by the , families wearing masks pleaded for Russian officials to grant them special visas. They described painful histories of infertility and lost pregnancies, and bouts of depression from being unable to reach their children born in recent months.“Missing our child has been torturing us,” said one. “Because of this epidemic, my child is now born, but I cannot meet my child,” said another.Russia is not currently issuing visas to Chinese citizens. The Russian foreign ministry has been approached for comment.Gestational surrogacy, where the birth mother does not share any biological material with the child, is legal in Russia, but the practice is controversial. Its critics say it commercialises the birth process and can lead to the exploitation of surrogate mothers, including in cases where the pregnancy is lost.Chinese families going through an agent (James and Ling did not) will often pay £60,000 to an agency before factoring in flights and other costs. Prices paid to surrogate mothers, who are often from poorer Russian regions, start at approximately £11,500.The pandemic has also meant that surrogate mothers have been approached for extras, like in-hospital care, that they hadn’t anticipated. A surrogate mother who gave birth in May said that the absence of the family had complicated the process emotionally. “You feel like you’re giving away the child,” she said. She was asked to stay on to help provide childcare but declined and the child was put in the care of a nanny.Advocates for reuniting the families said reforming the industry was important but that the coronavirus pandemic should not prevent biological parents from coming to Russia to collect their children.“You can’t slow down a pregnancy, not with coronavirus or by any other bans. This process is going forward,” said Kirkora.She wants Russia to accept genetic tests as a basis for issuing visas to biological parents but said that would take time to organise.“There is a pressing issue in the transparency of the surrogacy industry,” said Ling. “Most unfortunately it is happening around the time when my baby is supposed to be born.”The situation has been complicated by the arrest on human trafficking charges of four doctors and four other employees – including a courier and a translator – from two fertility clinics that work with surrogate pregnancies.The cases relate to two incidents: the death of a child born to a surrogate from sudden infant death syndrome in January, and the discovery in an apartment in June of five children cared for by two Chinese nannies.The arrests have spread fear through the industry. Doctors have reportedly declined to treat surrogate mothers for fear of legal liability.Kirkora said that translators had refused to work at a recent forum on how to provide help to biological parents stuck outside the country. Several clinics and companies that provide surrogacy services cited the recent arrests when declining to speak for this article.“I’m worried like everyone that it’s going to touch my clients too,” said Inessa Matovich, the director of a Moscow company that provides surrogacy services mainly to families in Russia. “The world has gone crazy and the smallest, most defenceless beings have been hit. And they’re without their parents.”* Names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eca0004c7ff0506ba96cc958f2708900f5839e19/452_67_4917_2951/master/4917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=840e99965477beca766d5bc46cc6f82d","title":"unwind in malta your long weekend itinerary for a dose of r and r","story":"With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, it’s always the right time to kick back and relax in this culture-rich countryWritten about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

Since Japan prohibits holding dual nationality, she has retained her Japanese passport in order to feel close to her family, who live in her country of birth.Sawayama said that she contemplated renouncing her Japanese citizenship in order to become eligible, until she realised that it wouldn’t “solve anything” and that she disagreed with “this definition of Britishness”.Sawayama’s label, Dirty Hit, contacted the BPI to explain her nationality situation but “received a curt response”, according to Vice’s reporting.A BPI spokesperson said: “Both the Brit awards and the Hyundai Mercury prize aim to be as inclusive as possible within their parameters, and their processes and eligibility criteria are constantly reviewed.” The organisation did not answer questions from the .Percussionist and producer Sarathy Korwar, who was born in the US, raised in India and moved to the UK a decade ago, supported Sawayama on Twitter. “I’m not eligible for the Mercury prize either,” he tweeted. “Just one in many ways the othering occurs. We live here. We pay our taxes here. We make our music here. but …” The hashtag #SAWAYAMAISBRITISH was trending on Twitter on Wednesday (29 July).Sawayama recorded her critically acclaimed debut album, SAWAYAMA, in the UK and LA and said she is registered to pay tax in the UK. In 2018, she received a grant from the BPI’s Music Export Growth Scheme, which supports British musicians and music organisations looking to market themselves overseas.She would also be ineligible for the British categories at the Brit awards, also run by the BPI, which require artists to be UK passport holders. She would be eligible for the international categories. Prestigious British songwriting awards the Ivor Novellos, on the other hand, require artists to have lived in the UK for one year to be considered eligible.Sawayama said she wanted British awards bodies to take into account artists who have indefinite leave to remain “and change the rules to what Britishness means to them. The concept of Britishness has been in the public discourse in the most negative way possible – it has become very, very narrow in these last five to six years. I think the arts are somewhere that they can reverse that and widen it up.”She said: “If arts awards are creating their own sort of version of border control around their eligibility, I think that’s really problematic.”Elton John has described SAWAYAMA as “the strongest album of the year by far”. Addressing the omissions in this year’s list of Mercury prize nominees,  music critic Alexis Petridis described the album as “brilliantly inventive and futuristic”.The nominations for the 2020 Mercury prize were announced last week: Anna Meredith – Fibs Charli XCX – How I’m Feeling Now Dua Lipa – Future Nostalgia Georgia – Seeking Thrills Kano – Hoodies All Summer Lanterns on the Lake – Spook the Herd Laura Marling – Song for Our Daughter Michael Kiwanuka – Kiwanuka Moses Boyd – Dark Matter Porridge Radio – Every Bad Sports Team – Deep Down Happy Stormzy – Heavy Is the Head."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6451cdb0f2fb3b323cf01d1ba6162fe4edd80d7/0_0_5317_3544/master/5317.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fee474a9b45f565f73461fe2584490e5 700w","title":"rachel riley and tracy ann oberman drop libel claim over retweet","story":"Immigration lawyer Jane Heybroek ran up legal bill of £65,000The Countdown presenter Rachel Riley and actor Tracy-Ann Oberman have dropped their joint libel claim against a barrister for retweeting a critical blog post about the pair.Jane Heybroek, an immigration lawyer, said the duo had withdrawn their case after 18 months of legal action, which saw her run up a legal bill of £65,000.In 2019 Heybroek had retweeted a link to a lengthy blog post by a man called Shaun Lawson entitled “Beneath Contempt: How Tracy-Ann Oberman and Rachel Riley harassed, dogpiled and slandered a 16-year-old child and her father”. The article made allegations about the actions of Oberman and Riley towards a young Labour activist who had made comments about antisemitism in the party.Heybroek did not publish the original blog post, and said there was no evidence that anyone read it as a result of her retweet.Heybroek said she had spent tens of thousands of pounds on the case, while Riley and Oberman, who have been actively involved in highlighting allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party, were represented on a no-win, no-fee basis: “This meant that there was almost no risk to them in bringing the claim. Many people would have felt forced to settle for reasons of pragmatism.”At a hearing earlier this year, a judge described Heybroek as “broadly supportive of Jeremy Corbyn”, but said there was no other clear evidence of her political position.Heybroek said that despite Riley and Oberman’s “vocal stance against antisemitism” in other legal cases, this claim “did not actually involve any allegations of antisemitism”.“Unfortunately, as a result of the litigation, I was the subject of a number of nasty comments from a small minority of people who simply presumed to know what the case was about and what the outcome would be. They were wrong on both counts.”Riley and Oberman’s solicitor, Mark Lewis, of Patron Law, said in a statement that his clients “chose not to proceed further after the judge had determined that the opinion expressed was capable of being defamatory, in circumstances where Jane Heybroek claimed that she had promptly deleted her tweet”. They have both now made a contribution towards Heybroek’s costs.Lewis said: “Their libel insurers each did not see any advantage in pursuing a case over the liability of a retweet that was deleted so quickly. There are bigger fish to fry in the pursuit of those who choose to maintain a serious libel.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7abeec277e41c01c15e06ca317d756b2a14fdcd5/0_0_4029_2418/master/4029.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ce18c0ff4e760a397aeba5d383724b4a","title":"eoin morgans england delighted back first of three odis with ireland","story":"It is now established that Test cricket works better than most expected behind closed doors. On Thursday there is the opportunity to gauge whether the white-ball game, usually a much noisier one, can produce a worthwhile spectacle.At the Ageas Bowl, England play the first of three 50-over matches against Ireland in their first outing on home turf since winning the World Cup, so they have to step out without fanfare. Not that the captain, Eoin Morgan, seems too bothered by that. “Given the context of the last five months, I’m just delighted that we’re back playing again and that we have cricket back on TV. I’m extremely grateful to Ireland for agreeing to play.”Morgan says he has spoken to some of the Test players about playing in a deserted stadium. “There are moments in a Test, usually when the Barmy Army are going mad, when there is obviously home advantage. I think the most difficult challenge may be in the field, maintaining a high standard throughout and keeping that intensity.”Other challenges for Morgan have been more familiar. We are frequently informed that there are more players who England want to play than spaces available. That still seems to apply even though six of Morgan’s World Cup winners are engaged in the Test series and so are not available.“Selection was particularly difficult,” said Morgan. “Over the last four-and-a-bit years we’ve always had tough decisions to make and I think everybody who was left out had a tough call.”Those batsmen may be gifted and most of them are remarkably old. Of the specialists in this squad only Tom Banton of Somerset is under 29. “I think there is the perception that they’ve almost had their chance and their time has gone,” said Morgan. “Whereas we see it that going into the next World Cup, we need experienced guys making good decisions under pressure. That’s exactly what we’re after and experience lends itself to that. We’ll continue to give opportunities but it’s to those guys we feel might have an impact in selection on the next two T20 World Cups or the next 50-over World Cup.”Possible teams for the first ODI at the Ageas Bowl, Thursday 30 JulyIreland are now led by Andy Balbirnie and they have omitted some familiar names such as Gary Wilson, George Dockrell and Mark Adair. But some old favourites remain in Kevin O’Brien, William Porterfield and Boyd Rankin. Most unfamiliar on this side of the water are Gareth Delany, Harry Tector and the all-rounder Curtis Campher.This match heralds the start of the Super League, the qualification process for the 2023 World Cup. “This Super League is our opportunity to get in,” says Balbirnie. “And it’s going to be super-tough.”One other innovation is that no-balls will be called by the third umpire in this series, hopefully not too often."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e96a5277c6b1e4a5a4cb034d10e04ca96b1e855/0_998_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf6f07d62de7e239833be879b81a333c","title":"online porch sitting review split britches","story":"Hallowed quiet gives way to personal laments in an interactive re-creation of house-front chatter‘Some of our best conversations are in cars, benches, parks or porches,” says Lois Weaver, who leads this one-off interactive performance. It might be because we face the same direction, allowing our minds to wander and ourselves to think out loud, she says.Weaver, who is an artist, activist and one half of the performance troupe Split Britches, has orchestrated Porch Sitting in physical environments with her collaborator Peggy Shaw. Here she reformulates it for Zoom, as part of the Barbican’s online offering, to create a virtual porch for its participants. The purpose of the conversation is to “consider some survival strategies for our new world” as lockdown eases.We have been encouraged to substitute our profile pictures for a photograph of a favourite place or the view from our windows and there are enviably picturesque scenes, from hilltops in Hastings and the Northumberland coast to Johannesburg, New Zealand and a rose garden in Connecticut. These become our metaphorical porches and the backdrop to a ruminative, engaging and intimate aural show.Weaver is a relaxing presence, gently pulling in participants. A rotating panel speaks while others raise their hands virtually if they want to express an urgent thought. It creates the atmosphere of a Quaker Church meeting: slightly tense, hallowed, and with words weighted against meaningful silence.The net effect of an interactive show of this kind is invariably down to those involved and my fellow participants are a thoughtful, articulate and largely privileged bunch, or so it seems, describing lush gardens and beach views, though some mention the lack of outdoor space. The chatter is polite with discussions of time taking on a new texture, of gardening, and one mercifully fleeting mention of baking sourdough. It grows more personal, so it feels as if we are talking to ourselves as well as each other, with the soothing sounds of chirruping birds and ocean waves in the background.There are peaks of intensity and poetic moments: “There’s an old saying,” offers Weaver. “Don’t weed your garden, garden your weeds.” There are comparisons between rewilding nature and our own lives. Someone describes a photograph of the sea in Hong Kong, taken moments before the onset of a typhoon. The speaker relates it to the global storms taking place – both the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests. The conversation is hitting a note of positive consensus about lessons learned in lockdown when one participant storms in with a tirade of negativity. “Nature is beautiful but it’s nothing compared to a kiss on the cheek. Once you’ve seen one tree, you’ve seen them all. It’s been very, very difficult. Even Grindr stopped working!”It is funny in its honesty and has a cathartic effect that changes the mood completely. Lockdown has been harder for some than others, we are reminded, and once the floodgates are opened others speak of feeling confined and of the Covid-19 death toll. It seems as if we are stopping just as we’ve got to the meat of it, which Weaver says is often the case. Are we still in the eye of the storm? What have we learned? Are we less free than we were? No answers are found but fruitful questions have been asked, and they linger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c9898914858e65ed443d2a4eccda28769613dc7/0_10_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56bf0152d957777282129afd382587e2","title":"tech congress hearing zuckerberg bezos cook facebook amazon apple","story":"Jerry Nadler unimpressed with Mark Zuckerberg’s answer on Instagram deal, while Amazon boss Jeff Bezos accused of hypocrisyRepresentative Lucy McBath of Georgia asks Tim Cook whether Apple has the power to exclude apps from the App Store.She shows the examples of Apple’s proprietary Screen Time apps overtaking parental control apps in the app store.

This is fundamentally unfair harms small businesses that rely on you to reach customers and stifles innovation. that is the lifeblood of our economy, ultimately, reduces the competition and choices that are made available to consumers.Representative Gaetz is back with another line of questioning insinuating anti-conservative bias from Facebook.That’s all I will say about that as the argument was fairly hard to follow. Representative Val Denings of Florida asks Zuckerberg about other ways Facebook has gone after large competitors.She cited Facebook blocking Pinterest from using its technology to share content. Zuckerberg essentially admits to it - a key distinction in the antitrust debate. Representative Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota asks Bezos about Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) complaints relating to music used on Twitch. It has been reported that Twitch users have been blindsided by requests to remove music from their videos. Bezos acts as though he is completely unaware of the problem and, potentially, how Twitch even works. Hank Johnson of Georgia asks Bezos about counterfeit products on Amazon, saying the company tries to avoid responsibility for third party sellers on its platform while also putting the cost burden on these third parties to police the site. Bezos said Amazon does a lot to prevent counterfeiting, and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in systems to detect counterfit products.The hearing will take a brief recess now. Representative Jerry Nadler addresses the issues Facebook and Google have caused in the media industry.“Facebook and Google have greatly threatened journalism in the United States. Reporters have been fired, local newspapers have been shut down,” he said. “This is a very dangerous situation.”Specifically he asked Zuckerberg about accusations Facebook overstated the success of videos posted to its social network, leading many media companies to beef up their video teams. When the inflated numbers never came to fruition, the pivot cost hundreds journalists their jobs. “Do you realize the harm this caused journalists across the country?” he asked. Zuckerberg claimed he did not know these numbers were inflated. “We regret the mistake”, he said. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland goes in on Bezos over Amazon’s market share in the smart home space, specifically given the ubiquity of its smart speaker Alexa. He said Alexa is often heavily discounted and suggests it is pushed on consumers as a means to continue pushing Amazon products long term. Raskin notes that when he asks Alexa to buy batteries, the assistant first suggests Amazon-brand batteries. Raskin asks: Alexa trained to favor Amazon products?“I don’t know if it’s been trained in that way,” Bezos said. “I’m sure there are cases where we do promote our own products is of course a common practice in business so it wouldn’t surprise me if Alexa sometimes does promote our own products.”Raskin also noted Amazon’s continued acquisition of other market shares. He reads an email Bezos sent to staff when buying smart doorbell Ring: “We’re buying market position not technology, and that market position and momentum is very valuable.” Ring now has more than 1,000 partnerships with local police forces.Representative Jayapal returns to intensive questioning of Zuckerberg over anticompetitive practices including acquiring competitors or threatening them. She cited Instagram’s acquisition as an example, reading evidence gathered that Instagram founder Kevin Systrom said he was afraid of Zuckerberg and how Facebook would respond if he declined to sell the platform. Jayapal’s closing comment was a zinger:Facebook is a case study, in my opinion, in monopoly power. Because your company harvests and monetizes our data, then your company uses that data to spy on competitors and to copy, acquire, and kill rivals. You’ve used Facebook’s power to threaten smaller competitors and to ensure that you always get your way. Facebook’s very model makes it impossible for new companies to flourish separately, and that harms our democracy, it has harms mom and pop businesses and it harms consumers.Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia in her questioning played a recording from a book seller who sold books on Amazon and felt her sales were throttled by Amazon. In the recording, she pleads with Bezos to help her company.Many advocates for small businesses praised the tactic, noting that it is rare to see Bezos confronted with the impact of his business. Bezos was also faced with criticisms that third party sellers have extreme difficulty contacting anyone at the company when they have problems selling on the platform. One seller quoted even compared Amazon to a drug dealer, saying “because you just kept going and you had to get your next fix, but at end of the day you find out that this person was seemingly benefitting is ultimately going to be your downfall.”In fact, there is a whole industry dedicated to helping these sellers when Amazon will not. Representative Joe Neguse asks Zuckerberg about Facebook’s acquisitions of other companies and competitors, citing the purchases of Instagram and Whatsapp as examples. He asked Zuckerberg about an email he sent that was discovered in the investigation, in which Zuckerberg wrote: “I can just buy any competitive startup - but it’ll be a while before we can buy Google.”“I don’t recall specifically, but it sounds like a joke,” Zuckerberg said. Neguse said Facebook’s market share in the last several years is “not a joke.” The company has used that power to “either purchase or replicate the competition”.“Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram, are the most now downloaded apps of the last decade, and your company sir owns them all,” he said. “We have a word for that, and that word is ‘monopoly.’”A verbal scuffle breaks out on the floor when Representative Mary Gay Scanlon opened her questioning with a sharp criticism of Steube and other Republicans.“I’d like to redirect your attention to antitrust law rather than fringe conspiracy theories,” she said.She again questioned Amazon over its strategies to overtake competitors, using an example of diaper sales as an example. In a strange exchange, yet another congress member has targeted the tech executives over supposed anti-conservative bias. Representative Greg Steube asked Sundar Pichai why his campaign emails are being sorted into the Spam inbox on his parents’ Gmail accounts. He claimed it was an anti-conservative conspiracy. “This is appears to only be happening to conservative Republicans,” he said. “I don’t see anything in the news or anything in the press or members on the other side of the aisle talking about their campaign emails getting thrown in junk folders in Gmail - so my question is is why is this only happening to Republicans?” he asked.Pichai said “there is nothing in the algorithm that has to do with political ideology”.A report from the Markup published in February found many political candidates - both conservative and progressive - find that Google’s algorithm sends their emails to Spam or to other inboxes. Upon return from the recess, finally a question for Bezos. Rep. Pramila Jayapal asks if Amazon accesses data from third parties to sell its own brands, asking Bezos for “a yes or no” answer. Bezos gives a rambling response, declining to deny or confirm the allegation. Jayapal notes that an April 2020 investigation from the Wall Street Journal found evidence that Amazon does engage in such anticompetitive practices. Amazon has access to data that “far exceeds” the sellers on the platform with whom it competes, the report found. “So you can set the rules of the game for your competitors, but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,” she said. “Do you think that’s fair to the mom and pop third party businesses who are trying to sell on your platform?”Another flashpoint in the first hours of the hearing - and one that arguably does not have to do with antitrust - was questions from Matt Gaetz of Florida regarding whether Google will continue to work with police despite backlash. Pichai said Google has no plans to end police contracts. “Congressman, we are committed to continuing to work with law enforcement,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Lowered his mask. And boomed into a microphone over the hum of car engines. “I now confirm that you, the 2020 Holmes County Central high school class, are completers of high school in the great state of Mississippi. Congratulations to my graduates,” he said.A muted round of applause seemed to evaporate into the open air, before Pomp and Circumstance blasted over the loudspeakers to a near-empty parking lot.“We had to give them something, because they have lost so much,” Henderson said. “Giving them the opportunity to walk across that stage. For their parents to see them walk, it’s just the ultimate, right?”Among Holmes county’s class of 2020 were aspiring business people, doctors and surgeons, accountants, sports therapists, scientists and writers. Each was graduating into a time of economic and political uncertainty, just days before the country erupted into mass protest following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Although personal tragedy had marked some of their childhoods, every student spoke with clarity about their vision of the future.“Today is different from how I imagined it because not all my family can come to support me. I have my mom, my two sisters and my girlfriend. My dad called me last night to tell me how proud he was, because he wasn’t in my life like he should have been. My grandaddy just recovered from Covid so he’s watching online. My best memory of high school is catching an interception during a football game against Cleveland Central this year. I worked so hard for that moment. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety, but I push myself so hard to make everyone proud. I’m going to Northeast Community college, and my dream is to play football professionally. But if my dream is not what God has planned, I want to be a physical therapist.”“Finishing school during the pandemic was hard, because where I live we really don’t have internet service. I had to sit by a window and try to get signal, to get all my work together and have a chance to graduate.They cancelled prom because of the pandemic, and I was just really sad because I never got to experience it and pick out a dress.I want to show my mom that the daughter she raised, the person I became, made all her work worth it. She did it for a reason. I’m planning on joining the army reserves, I want to branch out and see the world.”“I consider the class of 2020 to be possibly the strongest class in history. It’s been so different for us to go through all of this and still be successful.I spent two days writing my salutatorian speech to make sure it came from my heart. I told my class to stay focused, keep a tunnel vision on your dreams and let there be no limitations on you.This year’s valedictorian, Issac Randle Jr, delivered a speech urging his class to “live life and not let life live you”. His parents watched on from a parked red pickup truck, decorated with the words: “Quarantine couldn’t hold me I’m free at last.”They cheered as Randle was the first to pick up his diploma, a broad smile across his face. He will attend the University of Mississippi to study accounting under a grant and a scholarship.“He stayed the course,” said his mother Matilda. “And knowing that his hard work paid off. It just feels incredible.” The Randles planned to celebrate at home with a large family meal.Matilda Randle was far from the only proud parent that morning sitting quarantined inside their vehicle. Christine Baker, who had recently been furloughed from her job at a local car factory due to the pandemic, wore a T-shirt with her daughter Ma’Kiyah’s picture printed on it. She had raised her as a single parent.“I thanked God for allowing me to watch her walk that stage,” Baker said, tears in her eyes. “It meant everything to me. I went beyond and beneath, and put my life on the back burner to raise her.”The school district is preparing for a return to lessons next month. But as Covid-19 cases in the county surged over the summer and parents voiced their reluctance to send children back in person, there will be only online classes for high school students this term.Henderson watched in horror from Holmes county as Donald Trump thrust the issue of school return into the ongoing culture wars during the pandemic.“It seems like the federal government only cares about themselves and no one else. That the economy is more important to him than human beings,” he said. “But we here are taking care of ourselves.”Amber: “I’m going to Coahoma Community college this fall to study criminal justice. I want to be a lawyer. I see what’s going on in my community and there’s a lot of people getting charged unfairly. I want to be able to help those people.”“My fondest memory of high school will always be going with my classmates on field trips to experience different things out there in the world.I’m planning to go to college and study cosmetology. I want to open my own hair and nail salon, but I want to do it outside of Mississippi. I want to see something other than this state.”“There’s a lot of people dying and suffering right now, and I would love to be a part of the help. I’m going to Texas Southern University to study biology and then I want to train to become an anesthesiologist.It’s a dream I’ve had since middle school, watching Grey’s Anatomy and being interested in the simple jobs, besides the doctors and nurses, that people don’t really recognize.But tonight I’m just going to celebrate with family and have a cookout.”A number of Holmes County Central students were grappling with the loss of close family in recent years. The county has the 11th-lowest average life expectancy in the United States, at 71 years, which is seven and a half years below the national average.Tony Christopher Jr’s father passed away in February 2017 after a brief hospitalization. “They didn’t tell us too much about it, I just woke up one day and they told us he was in the hospital,” Christopher said, an image of his father printed on his graduation stole. “I just know he’d be very proud of me graduating because it’s something he didn’t do.”Mercedes Black lost her aunt to illness in April 2019. “If it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t have made it this far,” Black said, an image of her aunt adorning her graduation cap that was decorated in flowers. “When I was struggling in school she would help, she always told me to never give up. All she told me was that she wanted to see me graduate and walk that stage, and I just hate that she couldn’t be here to see us. She was like my second mom.”For a moment the ceremony dispensed with social distancing as Tamia Anderson took to the stage. As she collected her diploma, Henderson offered her a split-second hug as her great grandmother Roosevelt Anderson and grandmother Janice Harper screamed with joy from their car: “That’s my baby! You go girl!”In June 2018 Tamia’s mother took her own life. The aftermath was laced with trauma.“I didn’t really deal with it how I should have,” Anderson said. “I bottled up my emotions and it ended up turning into anger.”She was almost moved to an alternative school, but took time out for counseling and was allowed to return after a hearing. Tamia graduated almost at the top of her class.The Anderson family moved to Mississippi from Chicago 20 years ago after all three of Roosevelt’s sons were killed in the city, leaving Janice the only child still alive.“I moved here to get away from Chicago,” Roosevelt said. “I wanted to find a place where the family could always come for peace and rest.”The tragedy of the suicide compounded generations of grief. Tamia thought of her mother as she collected her diploma.“She’s smiling so hard right now, I can feel it all over me,” she said as she exited the stage. The family returned home straight after, to a residence in the hills outside Lexington with manicured lawns, blooming flowers and a horse grazing in a small field.Tamia walked to her mother’s grave in a plot by the house, and reflected on the completion of her high school education.“It means so much to me,” she said of the ability to graduate in person. “You have no idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f36736f1636410a00bafd6b1679f8dacc3b96ec9/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b55114dac774e110c82828279a7ac018","title":"coronavirus uk signs deal for 60m doses potential vaccine","story":"GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur could supply vaccine by early next year if successfulBritain has become one of the biggest buyers of potential vaccines against Covid-19, following an agreement to purchase a fourth vaccine that takes the UK stockpile to 250m doses so far.In a worldwide scramble, which has been criticised by campaigners who warn vaccine nationalism will cause billions of people in poorer countries to lose out, the UK, the US and EU are in effect securing their own supplies. Wealthy countries are able to take a gamble, signing deals for vaccines that may not work.The latest contract signed by the UK is with the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and its French partner, Sanofi Pasteur, for 60m doses of the Covid-19 vaccine they are developing. It already has deals for 100m doses of the Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccine and for 90m doses of two others.The hope is that the UK could begin to vaccinate priority groups, such as frontline health and social care workers and those at increased risk from coronavirus, as early as the first half of next year, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.Human clinical studies of the GSKSanofi vaccine will begin in September followed by a phase 3 study in December. The vaccine is not as far ahead in the development process as that being worked on at Oxford University, which is already in large-scale human trials in Brazil and the US, where there are many more infections than in Europe.The Covid-19 vaccines in development fall into roughly four groups, according to the technologies on which they are based. The government strategy is to buy several vaccines from each group, Kate Bingham, the chair of the government’s vaccine taskforce, has said.The government accepts it could lose money on some. If all of them work, “we will be the vaccine supplier to the world”, she said, “but the likelihood is most of these will fail”. The intention was to buy up to 12 vaccines.The US is intent on ensuring access for its citizens to the first available vaccines and its “America-first” policy will prohibit US companies from supplying them elsewhere in the world until its needs are met. There were promising trial results recently from Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has begun large-scale phase 3 vaccine trials.The EU is working as a bloc to buy vaccines that are not produced in the US. The commission has secured a deal with AstraZeneca for 400m doses of the Oxford vaccine and is looking to invest in at least five others.The US has not revealed how many potential vaccine doses it has bought, but its figure is thought to significantly exceed Britain’s.The UK business secretary, Alok Sharma, said: “Our scientists and researchers are racing to find a safe and effective vaccine at a speed and scale never seen before. While this progress is truly remarkable, the fact remains that there are no guarantees.“In the meantime, it is important that we secure early access to a erse range of promising vaccine candidates, like GSK and Sanofi, to increase our chances of finding one that works so we can protect the public and save lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e890cb2689be785c1a094f5fb1c66e9ebd3b9d16/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=26abc72b2793e548ab5dacb75e5204a1","title":"vietnam on high alert coronavirus cases major cities hanoi","story":"First local case in three months reported over the weekend in holiday spot of Da NangVietnam is on high alert and bracing for a rise in coronavirus cases, after local media reported that infections have been detected in the capital, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands region.The country’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned on Wednesday that every province and every city was at risk, adding that the new “wave” appeared to be different to that seen in Vietnam earlier this year.Vietnam, which has been praised for its response to the pandemic, reported its first local case for more than three months last weekend, after a man in the central city of Da Nang became ill. Officials have said that the recent infections involve a new strain of the virus that has originated outside of the country, and which seemed to be more virulent.So far, 30 cases of the virus have been detected in or around Da Nang, while two cases have been confirmed in Ho Chi Minh City, and one has been reported in both Hanoi and Central Highlands. There are growing fears that tens of thousands of people holidaying in the coastal city of Da Nang may have transported the virus across the country over recent weeks.“We have to act more swiftly and more fiercely in order to control the outbreak,” the state broadcaster VTV reported Phuc as telling a meeting of government officials. He said tourist hubs throughout the country should increase vigilance.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The government is evacuating 80,000 people from Da Nang, mostly tourists who had been taking advantage of discounted travel deals, who will be required to isolate at home. The city has been placed under strict lockdown, with flights suspended.VTV reported that the cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were linked to the cluster in Da Nang.Life in Vietnam had been returning to normal, with many people no longer wearing face masks and domestic tourism booming, but the country is again on high alert. In Hanoi, authorities are tracing people who may have had close contact with a man who works in a pizza restaurant and who is suspected of having Covid-19. Barriers have been placed near to the man’s home, while the restaurant and local area have been disinfected.In Ho Chi Minh City, a hotel has been locked down and a nearby hospital in Binh Tan district has stopped receiving patients for three days, after two suspected Covid-19 cases emerged.About 18,000 tourists who had been in Da Nang have returned to Ho Chi Minh City, officials said on Tuesday. Hanoi authorities had earlier said they were expecting 15,000 to 20,000 to return from the city.The country responded with speed and agility to the pandemic earlier this year, deploying aggressive contact-tracing systems and quarantine measures – avoiding a major outbreak. Despite sharing a border with China, Vietnam has recorded 446 450 Covid-19 cases, and no fatalities.This figure does not include 140 construction workers infected with Covid-19 who were evacuated from Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday, and who will be treated at a hospital outside Hanoi.The source of the new cases is not clear, though the government has responded with a series of arrests linked to illegal immigration. Vietnam remains shut to most foreign travellers, and anyone who enters the country must quarantine on arrival.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"New Fortress Energy has said is pushing ahead to develop LNG terminal in Shannon EstuaryTillage has strong environmental benefits compared to other types of farming, report saysFacility means fusion takes step towards generating clean energy source at scale"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317078.1596053193!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"aer lingus to receive almost 30m for collecting ppe from china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA series of Aer Lingus flights to China   to collect PPE supplies required for medical staff during the  Covid-19 outbreak took place between March and June. File photograph: Tom HonanThe Aer Lingus is to receive almost €30 million from the Health Service Executive for the transport of vital supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) to Ireland from China since March in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.The airline operated a PPE airbridge for 14 weeks from March 29th to June 26th between Dublin and Beijing where 259 rotations between the two cities represented the largest cargo operation by air in the history of the State.According to the HSE, Aer Lingus operated up to five flights a day over the 14 weeks and in total flew 4.75 million km and transported 35,000 cubic metres or 4,000 tonnes comprising more than 86 million pieces of PPE.New records released in response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request show Aer Lingus has lodged invoices totalling €30.3 million to the HSE for the 259 flights.The invoices show the €30.3 million includes Russian over-flight charges made to Aer Lingus of €641,814 for the use of Russian airspace during the trips.The records show that the HSE had paid €7.2 million by the end of June to the airline and as of July 22nd, Aer Lingus had invoiced for a further €23.1 million that had not yet been paid.The average cost per flight to the HSE was €114,751 and the average Russian overflight charge was €3,116 concerning 198 of the 259 flights.Providing context to the spend, the HSE FOI unit stated: “The environment in which procurement activity was conducted in response to the pandemic was unprecedented. All global healthcare systems faced enormous challenges in securing PPE necessary to manage and contain the pandemic.“As part of the pandemic response, the HSE concluded an overarching framework agreement with China Resource Pharmaceutical Group for the supply of essential PPE.“The transportation of this PPE in a timely manner was critical and necessary to the pandemic response. The HSE agreed heads of terms with Aer Lingus, our national carrier, to open a standing air-bridge between Dublin and Beijing on a cost plus basis.“A value for money review has been conducted by HSE and the rates proposed by Aer Lingus were considered competitive in the circumstances.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: Getty The Government is unlikely to immediately review countries on its so-called green list or to consider regional travel corridors, in spite of some states experiencing big increases in Covid-19 cases recently, it has been confirmed.It is to stick to a fortnightly review of countries considered safe to travel to. The list was drawn up at a Cabinet meeting on July 21st based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet), and it will be August 4th at the earliest before it will re-examine the list, though some countries significantly exceed the Irish case rate.There are 15 countries on the green list, among them Finland, Greece, Malta, Italy, Cyprus, Monaco and Norway.The latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) confirm the extent of sharp rises in infection rates in some green list countries since July 21st, based on cases per 100,000 people over 14 days. Malta was the safest country, but cases have increased six-fold since then to 6.9 per 100,000, compared to Ireland, which is currently at 5.3.Low populationAs of Wednesday, Monaco has seen an 800 per cent increase to 27 per 100,000, though this is where there is a low population, while Cyprus have gone from 3.7 to 5.1. Finland has increased from 0.9 to 2.Travel to regions less affected by the Covid-19 pandemic within countries that are not themselves on the green list is “unlikely” to be approved by the Government. Liz Canavan, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach, said the Government is making its assessment for inclusion on the green list based on countrywide data. “We have been looking at it at a national level, that’s the most reliable, and once someone enters a country, we don’t really know where they go, so we’re operating on the national data,” she said at a Government briefing.She said the Cabinet may discuss the issue again when it next week considers the update to the list, but Ms Canavan said the criteria being applied includes “the national 14-day incidence rate, the trajectory, and other aspects of testing and tracing, so it was a broader range, but it was never looking at regional level.” A Department of Health spokeswoman said Nphet’s advice remains that all non-essential travel should be avoided. “Like all public health advice, this is kept under constant review. Any updated advice from Nphet is sent to Government for their consideration,” she added. Quarantine listThe UK government, however, has indicated it is prepared to look at a regional travel corridor to the Spanish islands, though it may add Luxembourg and Croatia to its Covid-19 quarantine list. The Covid operations committee will review “the air bridge system” on Friday.Transport minister Baroness Vere of Norbiton confirmed the idea was being investigated after pressure from Madrid over the change to travel advice made by the government over the weekend.The Spanish government has been lobbying their Irish counterparts for the inclusion of the Balearic Islands, including Mallorca and Ibiza, and the Canary Islands, on Ireland’s green list. The ECDC does not provide a breakdown of the Spanish figures to indicate rates of infections on the islands. The national figure was 51.1 per 100,000 people on Wednesday.The islands are currently excluded, along with the Spanish mainland, meaning anyone travelling into the State from these locations is asked to restrict their movements for 14 days on arrival. It has insisted lower levels of infection in the islands mean they are safe to travel to. Meanwhile Ryanair has declined to comment on its legal action against the Government in relation to the list. “We don’t comment on pending legal matters,” a spokeswoman said.Legal action threatenedThe airline has threatened legal action against the Government if it fails to expand the list of countries to which Irish travellers can go, include Britain and all EU member states.“The idea (which underlines Ireland’s green list) that the major economies of Europe are not dealing effectively with C-19 will do huge damage to our relations with those countries,” it said in a submission to the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response this week. “Ireland is an integrated part of the EU economy and if we lose this opportunity to restart, then we will pay for it with economic decline and massive increases in unemployment,” it added.

The High Court has appointed liquidators to St Mary’s Centre (Telford), a south Dublin nursing home, with the transfer of residents elsewhere underway, the care home has said. In early June, the Merrion Road nursing home said it would be closing as it was unable to meet statutory and regulatory requirements, or fund the costs needed to meet them. Last Friday directors of St Mary’s centre applied for a High Court order to enter voluntary liquidation and wind down the service. The care home confirmed liquidators Baker Tilly had been appointed to oversee the closure of the service in a statement on Wednesday. The spokeswoman for St Mary’s centre said it had been a “very difficult decision to make but in the interest of the health and safety of our residents and staff, liquidation remained our only course of action.“This decision was reached by the board following a number of meetings concerning the funding of the nursing home and the disability centre - and the ability to acquire the necessary funding to ensure the highest standards of care and regulatory compliance for the health and safety of residents,” it said.The nursing home has 35 female residents, whose families were recently informed it would close by the end of the year. “The transfer of residents in the nursing home is underway and liquidators Baker Tilly will oversee the winding down of the company’s operation, across all its facilities,” the statement said. The nursing home has been the subject of critical inspection reports from the healthcare watchdog, the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa), in recent years. Reports published in 2017 and 2019 both criticised the governance and management of the centre, and the lack of privacy in one of the home’s units. St Mary’s centre was founded by the Sisters of Charity in 1868 as a school and home for visually impaired girls and women, but the religious order has said it has not been involved in managing the home since 1996. The Health Service Executive (HSE) said it had been involved in discussions around the “financial and infrastructural challenges at St Mary’s” when the centre announced it would close. “These discussions were ongoing with further meetings planned when the HSE became aware that the board of management of St Mary’s were intent on closing the nursing home element of the service,” a spokeswoman said. The HSE had been “awaiting further information and engagement with the board of management to discuss the transition of those services which had been advised would be closing,” she said. “Last Friday evening, 24th July, the HSE found out that the directors of St Mary’s had sought a High Court order for the voluntary liquidation of the service, including elements of which were yet to be discussed,” the spokeswoman said.Staff and residents’ families are to hold a demonstration outside of the Convention Centre on Thursday afternoon, while the Dáil is sitting there. Ann Ryan, a former staff member and spokeswoman for the Save St Mary’s group, said the planned closure of the nursing home was “appalling.” St Mary’s centre was a “viable facility that could be easily taken over by the State”, and the group were appealing for the HSE to step in and run the service, she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316865.1596050534!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pup explainer what s the latest on pandemic payment squabble","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople can now travel to green list countries if they are on the pandemic unemployment payment, or other forms of unemployment assistance. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinWhat happened on Wednesday morning? Firstly, the Government U-turned. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys confirmed saying that those on unemployment assistance can travel to green list countries without their payment being interrupted.How is this different from before? On Tuesday night, Ms Humphreys was arguing the opposite, saying that PUP and other jobseekers’ payments are available only to those in the country. The traditional flexibility for holidays was suspended since July 10th.So now, what’s the bottom line? People can travel to green list countries if they are on the pandemic unemployment payment, or other forms of unemployment assistance. However, anyone leaving the State permanently, or going to a non-green list country for non-essential reasons will still lose it.What about people who have already lost their payment for going on holiday? Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Ms Humphreys have promised a review. Just how the review will proceed, how long it will take, and what refunds it will make, if any, is unclear. However, the Department of Social Protection is asking those who feel wronged to contact it.How many people might be affected by that anyway? We only have Government statements to go on, not published data, but Ms Humphreys has said 90 per cent of the 2,500 or so who have had payments suspended had left the State permanently. That suggests only 250 or so could be holidaymakers. It’s not clear exactly, though, how Social Protection tells the difference between someone leaving permanently and a holidaymaker.And what about quarantining? This issue has receded into the background a little. Earlier this week, Social Protection said people quarantining after holidays could not claim unemployment assistance.Lawyers believe this is a flimsy argument, especially if it is withheld on the grounds that the person is not “genuinely seeking work”, since one could easily be doing that on the phone or internet.Are there any other legal issues? The PUP is being put on a statutory basis at the moment, so that should shore up the Government’s position for future cases. However, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) and the Free Legal Advice Clinics (Flac) all suggest that decisions made up to now could be challenged. If so, that requires someone to challenge them.What about data privacy issues? Earlier this week, there were concerns that Social Protection had harvested passenger data from the airport or airlines. However, it denies that, saying it gathers all of its information from social welfare inspectors working in the airport alongside gardaí.So that’s the end of that then? Not quite. Social Protection relies on a piece of legislation from 2012 which gives it the power to ask people questions at ports and airports, but they must have a reasonable suspicion that someone is trying to cheat the system.Flac has drawn attention to this need for an evidence-based suspicion, amid widely circulating reports of people being asked for their information at the airport.“Checks at the airport cannot be randomised or based on arbitrary criteria or happen by way of blanket checks on all passengers waiting for a flight,” it argues, adding that airport checks should be “quite rare”.Meanwhile, there is the Data Protection Commissioner. It has already asked Social Protection and lodged more after it got the first replies. We have not seen the last of this, not by any stretch.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317032.1596050228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sam mcconkey covid 19 is grumbling around young people","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn Ireland  75 per cent of Covid-19 cases are now among those under 45, with a median age of 33.Covid-19 is “grumbling” around younger people in Ireland threatening a “big explosion” again through the older, more vulnerable population, an infectious diseases expert has warned.Prof Sam McConkey, head of the department of international health and tropical medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland, said less vigilance because of lower numbers of cases risked sending the virus “wild” again.The current trend in confirmed cases is “very similar to what we had in February and March before we had large numbers of elderly people getting it, who sadly passed away from it,” he said.“This is the sort of grumbling of the virus among young healthy people, who are often minimally symptomatic.“The risk is that they inevitably meet with their parents and grandparents and older people and then in two or four weeks’ time it all goes wild in older people again.”Dr Ronan Glynn, the acting chief medical officer, said earlier this week that 75 per cent of cases are now among those under 45, with a median age of 33.While young people are unlikely to die from the virus, they are likely to spread it around, said Mr McConkey.‘Not there yet’“I think we can’t relax. I think some of us feel there are very few deaths now, the numbers are down a lot from March and April, so let’s just relax. I think that is very much the wrong message,” he said.Mr McConkey, who advocates suppressing the virus until there is zero unexplained community transmission, said Ireland is struggling to get to that stage.“We are not there yet. And unfortunately as long as we’ve got unexplained community transmission on the island, there will still be a risk of it going into a big explosion like we had in February and March,” he told Newstalk.Citing New Zealand as an example, Mr McConkey said zero unexplained community transmission could mean sports fans returning en masse to matches and “we get back more to normal”.“It is a matter of the whole population keeping together, keeping our message, social distancing and masks and so on,” he added.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317083.1596056705!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord miche%C3%A1l avoids mention of u turn as pup panto ends on a bum note","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMonaghan’s Heather Humphreys, aka the Sugar Plum Farney, announced the PUP review in the Dáil before the Taoiseach took to the stage.  Photograph: Julien BehalPA WirePanto season already in the Convention Centre and the Wednesday matinee is in full swing.Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Féin’s Principal Boy, strides onstage in a glitzy blizzard of big polka-dots. Slapping her thigh, she stomps to a stop and glares at the Taoiseach, chief bottlewasher among the Coalition’s Three Ugly Misters (Martin, Varadkar and Ryan).“Having issued inconsistent and confused travel advice, you now say that workers on a Covid payment can’t take a holiday - a holiday that they may have paid for 12 months ago, a holiday, perhaps, to one of your ‘green list’ countries,” she cries.O-oh! Mary Lou doesn’t know about the U-turn. But she keeps going.The workers “can’t do those things without fear of losing their income” she choruses, upping the volume.A familiar sing-song voice rises up from the Grand Circle.“Oh yes they can!”For it is Monaghan’s Heather Humphreys, aka the Sugar Plum Farney (a GAA county gag there for sports fans in the audience). Ten minutes earlier, she waved her magic wand out of the blue in the near-empty theatre and banished the Pandemic PUP clause Mary Lou was fulminating about.But Sinn Féin’s Principal Boy wasn’t there to see it so is none the wiser.She waxes on about the disgraceful treatment of the poor Covid travellers. “The billionaire classes and tax exiles have been accommodated - no penalty for them, not a chance. They have been facilitated. The Government’s utter hypocrisy and unfairness is galling,” she roars, slapping her thigh again.Micheál Martin simmers inside his paper fortress of files in front of the proscenium arch. If he had a moustache he’d be twiddling it. Just wait until he gets the chance to triumphantly tell her that the evil PUP restriction is no more.Mary Lou delivers her closing number.“Your lack of understanding, your lack of empathy for people who have been through the mill and have lost their jobs is remarkable. You said, remember, that we’re all in this together but it is clear now that we’re not all in this together,” she hollers, oblivious to Monaghan Heather’s earlier vanishing trick.Micheál must have been laughing inside, although he didn’t show it.But the audience is having a ball, roaring at the Principal Boy: “You’re behind the curve, Mary Lou! Behind the curve!”She sashays off to frown from the wings.This’ll be good.“Deputy McDonald loves throwing accusations about the place and making assertions about this government’s overall policy” he declaims, embarking on a lengthy monologue. He talks tantalizingly about everything but the glaringly obvious: the fact that the PUP regulation Mary Lou is complaining about about has already been dropped. End of.‘Look behind you!’Little eyes widened in the audience. Was there a twist in this panto plot? Could it be that Micheál Martin didn’t know either about the sudden U-turn on withholding the Pandemic Unemployment Payment from recipients going abroad for a few days?He was probably on his way to the auditorium when the Sugar Plum Farney quietly confessed during the dead zone of Ministerial Questions that her department was shelving the controversial clause.“Cathaoirleach,” she ventured sweetly, “I was wondering if you’d mind terribly if I made a short statement to the House?” That’s how it happened.When the Taoiseach didn’t immediately put Mary Lou right on the current state of play, people began wondering if the decision to drop the measure was made by a Fine Gael Social Welfare Minister on a solo run without alerting the Fianna Fáil chief bottle washer. He certainly seemed unaware of it.“Look behind you!” we yelled to Micheál. “Look behind you!”Monaghan’s Sugar Plum Farney, was sitting directly behind him. Expressionless. Didn’t even pass across a note to jog his memory about her surreptitiously changing tack before he arrived in.But Micheál never once acknowledged the axing of the PUP travel clause despite Mary Lou building her questions around it.Meanwhile, one media outlet was tipped off in advance about Heather’s imminent Dáil announcement. When other outlets complained, Fine Gael sources blamed Fianna Fáil sources for the leak. Then Fianna Fáil sources blamed Fine Gael.If Fianna Fáil was the culprit, then it follows that the party leader must have been aware of the PUP rowback. If so, the Taoiseach is quite the actor. He gave no indication, ten minutes after Heather’s Dáil statement, that he knew anything. By loftily talking around it and singing the praises of the PUP scheme, he managed to avoid all embarrassing talk of U-turns.Melodrama kingThe panto went up a gear in the final act with the arrival of thigh slapping crowd pleaser Alan Kelly, melodrama king of the new Dáil.He thrilled the audience with a suggestion that former tánaiste Simon Coveney is driving around town in a swanky car on a politically provisional licence.Simon didn’t put in an appearance, although he is treading the boards these days with Leo Varadkar as one part of popular panto duo, The Grandiosity Brothers. Leo also moonlights with Micheál and Eamon as one of the Three Ugly Misters.Audiences find their act hilarious – Varadkar walks everywhere with a uniformed military attaché who wears a wide gold sash across his chest and carries a swagger stick while Coveney cruises around in an enormous Cuban style sedan with two liveried drivers up front. Some of his Fine Gael colleagues find this rib-splitting because Simon pioneered the abolition of State cars and drivers. The gardaí were very annoyed at the time.But back to Alan Kelly, who wondered aloud about Coveney’s mode of ministerial transport and why he has been given a State car and drivers when Government policy is that only the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Justice are entitled to that privilege.The decision to give out the extra car didn’t happen on his watch, insisted Micheál, washing his hands of the matter. It’s a security matter and he isn’t going to question it.The last minister for foreign affairs was Fine Gael’s Charlie Flanagan, who supplied his own car and had a civilian driver.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316564.1596058343!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pup u turn welfare recipients free to travel to green list countries","story":"Recipients of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) who travel to green list countries will still receive the payment, Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys has told the Dáil. Video: RTÉ Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government  said those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment will not now have this payment docked if they travel to a green list country. Photograph: Collins A review by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection determined that 85 out of the 2,500 people who had their pandemic unemployment payment stopped for leaving the country may in fact be entitled to it. The Department said it would be contacting each of these iniduals in the coming days. The Government u-turned on Wednesday and said it would continue the payment for those who travelled to Green List countries. Several sources insisted last night that Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys’ decision to change tack had been communicated to Taoiseach Micheál Martin, beforehand. However, the fallout from the controversy continued. A spokesman for the department said it defined someone as having left the country permanently when an inidual has “had their payment stopped, not returning to the country seeking to have their payment reinstalled”.A senior trade union source said the change to the rules for PUP recipients should be reflected in guidelines for public servants, who currently face having to take leave on their return from holidays to quarantine. Sources said the Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath is examining whether the advice now also needs to change on foot of the announcement. It is understood he has not yet signed off on any changes.Data protectionThe Data Protection Commissioner also said on Wednesday evening that it had not received responses from the department on the issue. Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said it had sought clarity on Tuesday on the basis of which names and PPSNs were gathered by the Department when policing compliance on travel rules.On Wednesday in the Dáil, Ms Humphreys admitted her department could have communicated more effectively about PUP entitlements for those travelling overseas, and said the cases of all those who left the State for holidays would be reviewed.She told TDs she had asked “people who wish to travel on any of the countries on the green list can do so and continue to receive their payment”.But she said people who travel to the countries not on the green list can only do so for “essential reasons”. She pointed out that of the 2,500 people whose payments have been stopped, 90 per cent were leaving the country permanently.The Minister said that since the regulations relating to jobseekers were signed on July 10th the Government’s travel advice had changed with the publication of the green list.“I have now asked my officials to amend the regulations so that people on jobseekers who wish to travel to any countries on the green list can do so and continue to receive their payments.”The Minister said she had “listened to the concerns expressed in recent days in relation to people whose payment was stopped due to the fact that they were travelling abroad on holiday”. She said there were people who may have travelled abroad and “genuinely not being aware of the travel guidance or criteria which applies to PUP”.ClashesDespite the announcement, clashes continued in the Dáil where Taoiseach Micheál Martin defended the withholding of the PUP from some people leaving the State.Mr Martin didn’t reference Ms Humphreys’ statement but said as few as 100 people had had their PUP payments stopped for holidays abroad and he called for “honesty and a degree of perspective”.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald claimed the Government was “blatantly” discriminating against workers on the PUP. She said they could not go on holidays they might have paid for last year but “the billionaire classes, the tax exiles have been accommodated.“No penalty for them, not a chance” and this was “utter hypocrisy”, he she added. Nobody should be travelling abroad but if they were penalised for doing so the penalties should be universal.She added “it seems to me that you acted outside the law”.Mr Martin said Ms McDonald “loves throwing accusations about the place”. Accusing the Sinn Féin leader of “play acting”, the Taoiseach pointed out that he had already said there should be a review of cases where payments had been cut to any holidaymakers.Rise TD Paul Murphy said the situation was “a shambles”. He referred to the statement by Ms Humphreys and said it appeared to be “at least a partial U-turn on the policy and leaves PUP recipients wondering has the discrimination being ended” and if that money would be reinstated.But, Mr Murphy said, the Taoiseach had just spent five minutes “speechifying” about everything other than the payment. “Can you please provide clarity?” he asked Mr Martin.The Taoiseach said “the assertion of shambles is wrong”. Mr Martin said he was not responsible for operational decisions and that people on the ground had responsibility for social protection.Controversy erupted after it emerged at the weekend that recipients of the €350 emergency payment were having the benefit docked for overseas travel.Last night, the Dáil passed legislation putting the PUP payment on a statutory basis and extending it to the end of March at a cost of €2.2 billion."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317038.1596050455!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach urged to rebuke colleague over lazy public servants claim","story":"A Government backbencher has accused public servants of laziness and claimed that they are using the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to “lie on the couch and watch box sets”. Video: Oireachtas TVSinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin has written to Micheál Martin about the comments by Sligo-Leitrim TD Marc MacSharry which he said were “wrong, offensive and isive”.Mr MacSharry had alleged that public sector productivity had fallen and this was “unacceptable” as he launched a broadside attack on “many elements of our State agencies, Government departments and local authorities” who he claimed were opportunistic in using the crisis “to do nothing”.The Fianna Fáil TD said he had had “dealings” recently with one State agency “where no one will be back in that office until the end of August”. They are working from home and “you have to talk to an answering machine”.In the letter to the Taoiseach, Mr Ó Broin asked if Mr MacSharry’s remarks “are representative of the policies of Fianna Fáil and of your Government? If not I would strongly urge you to make a public comment on the matter distancing you, your party and your Government from such remarks”.Defending the public service Mr Ó Broin said that “both public and private sector workers are doing everything they can in the national interest while at the same time making significant sacrifices”. “To be treated in this manner by a Government TD will undoubtedly impact on morale and cohesion in the public sector. “It also potentially creates ision between public and private sector workers.”Mr MacSharry had praised staff in the Department of Social Protection who had got so many Covid-related schemes up and running and “managed to get money to people pretty quickly, in the main. They deserve much credit”.But he contrasted that effort with “many elements” in the public service who are “using this situation as cover to lie on the couch and watch box sets, returning an odd call here and there and doing the maximum of the minimum to tick over during this period”.Whether it was “opportunism... laziness andor poor management, it needs to be addressed because the country needs all its officials working at full tilt to get productivity levels up to the maximum so we get through this crisis in the best possible way”. He contrasted poor public sector performance with private sector activity much of which was back “at full tilt”.He said staff in his own office “did not stop for an hour since the onset of Covid-19”. Speaking during a debate on legislation putting the pandemic unemployment payment on a statutory footing, Mr MacSharry said he knew Minister for Enterprise Heather Humphreys had “worked at full tilt throughout this time.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireFormer taoiseach Leo Varadkar intervened to ask whether Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney could retain use of a State car, a Government spokesman has confirmed, as controversy over the issue continued in the Dáil.“The secretary general in the Department of the Taoiseach, at the request of the previous Taoiseach, did call the secretary general of the Department of Justice to ask if it was appropriate, on security grounds, for Minister Coveney to retain a security service,” the spokesman said.“An Garda Síochána acted on this request, and this is a matter for An Garda Síochána as it is a security issue.”Earlier, Labour leader Alan Kelly claimed Mr Coveney was using a State car and Garda drivers “without permission” because no Cabinet decision was made to approve the move.Taoiseach Micheál Martin insisted, however, that “it doesn’t require a Government decision” for the Minister to retain the car and security.Mr Kelly put Mr Martin under pressure in the Dáil about Mr Coveney keeping the car and Garda security without Cabinet approval.The Taoiseach said the security assessment was that Mr Coveney - who is also Minister for Defence - should retain his car, adding: “And I’m not getting involved in terms of any security appraisal.”The Taoiseach was responding to the Labour leader and Tipperary TD for the second day in a row about who made the decision to allow Mr Coveney retain his State car and Garda drivers at an annual cost to taxpayers of €200,000, even though he is no longer tánaiste.In 2011, the Fine Gael-Labour cabinet approved a decision that only the taoiseach, tánaiste and minister for justice should retain a State car, rather than all Government ministers.Mr Kelly had said that since there was currently no change in that position, the retention of the car without Cabinet approval raised serious questions.He said: “So now you have a Minister going around in the Garda car that’s costing €200,000 a year without permission because there’s no Government decision.”He asked the Taoiseach: “Were you aware of that and did you give him permission to do so, because it is going to be deeply concerning if you did not?”‘Not getting involved’Mr Martin said he was “not getting involved” in any security appraisal around Mr Coveney retaining the car even though he is no longer tánaiste.He said: “This communication happened before I became Taoiseach.” He was elected Taoiseach on June 27th.Mr Martin said: “The secretary-general of the Department of Justice on Sunday 28th June received a query from the secretary to the Government as to whether or not it was appropriate on security grounds for Minister Coveney to retain his Garda driver.“And the security assessment from the gardaí to Justice is that he should retain it on security grounds.”Mr Kelly had asked: “Where did you ever hear of an audit of the security of a government minister being given orally over the phone to justify that?”The Labour leader had received correspondence in relation to parliamentary questions about the cost of a State car and two Garda drivers, which was put at €200,000."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Najib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:  Colin KeeganCollinsThe public debate in Ireland since the pandemic struck has revealed a prevalent assumption that travelling outside the island means going on holiday.Apart from being age and class-specific, this belief is deeply off-kilter for a nation with one of the highest proportions of its citizens living abroad in the world. One in six, according to a 2016 assessment, the highest level in the OECD.The equation of overseas travel with holidays, evident in statements by both government and opposition politicians, involves two key flawed assumptions.One is an idea that overseas summer holidays are a universal norm, rather than a luxury enjoyed by some. (The adoption of the term “staycation” to mean a holiday in Ireland, rather than the previously more common meaning of a holiday in your own house, is another illustration. Isn’t the quintessential summer holiday in Wexford? For whom is this a downgrade from a “real” holiday?)The other assumption involves a peculiar blindness to the reality that Irish families and work practices are international.“It’s bizarre . . . There can hardly be a household in the country without someone who can’t get home,” was how the disconnect was described to me by Dr Marc Scully, a lecturer in the psychology department at Mary Immaculate College Limerick who studies migration and the Irish diaspora.Flawed framingCoverage in the Irish media is also culpable for the flawed framing of the issue. As one of the Irish stranded abroad, it was jarring and disconcerting to read news about the government’s travel advice framed as a consumer story, and illustrated with photographs of beaches and headlines lamenting the loss of holidays this summer.The equation of travel with holidays was repeated throughout the furore over the Department of Social Protection’s cancellation of benefit payments to people who were found to be travelling through ports or airports.“If a person chooses to ignore public health advice and go on holidays, they are not just unavailable for work for the duration of their holiday, they are also unavailable for the two-week quarantine period on their return,” Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said in defence of the practice.This illustrates an assumption that if people are in an airport, they are there for leisure reasons.I’m a 2009 graduate. Airports don’t mean holidays to me. They mean work, and how I see my family.Dr Scully himself lived in Ireland while working in Britain for six months, taking a plane full of weary commuters each week on the red eye from Cork airport.“If this had happened three years ago, I would have been faced with the decision of: do I resign my job, or do I face not seeing my wife and son for six months? I can only imagine there are people who have had to make that decision,” Dr Scully said.“Or people who are caring for family members, who have suddenly had to make the decision of: do I quit my job, or do I suddenly try to sort out the caring responsibilities elsewhere?”“There’s a way of life there that has suddenly stopped,” he observed.Here are some reasons why people can be in an airport. On their way to collect someone from hospital. Going to a job interview. Seeing a solicitor about a will. On the way to hospital themselves.Airport storiesListen to the stories of those who were stopped in Dublin airport by the welfare officers and this is the reality that is reflected.Roman Shortall was stopped before boarding a flight to Romania with his family. Shortall’s wife, now a naturalised Irish citizen, is originally from Romania, and they were going to see a terminally ill relative. Their child benefit payments were stopped.Ciaran Cooney is a guitarist and singer with the Irish Celtic show who is resident in Ireland but earns 70 per cent of his income working abroad. His pandemic unemployment payment was stopped after he was checked boarding a flight to Glasgow to spend nine days with his partner, who he had not seen for 15 weeks. He had no income for six weeks and had to move back in with his parents.“There is no consideration for people who are in relationships with people who live outside the state or those of us who work abroad for a living but were fully tax compliant in Ireland all the time,” he wrote of the incident.To be absolutely clear: this is not a challenge to the government’s advice on travel. It’s an appeal to ground the debate in the reality of what travel means to the Irish population as a whole, and not the subsection that is primarily concerned about overseas holidays.Prior to the pandemic, Dublin to London was one of the busiest air routes in the world. That’s down to work and family ties, not tourism. This mobility is fundamental to how Ireland has operated as a nation since at least the last recession. Let’s axe the assumption that your two-week holiday in Portugal is the overriding issue at stake.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"\u0026lsquoShield of Israel\u0026rsquo plan devised after government\u0026rsquos response to the second wave widely seen as chaoticGrouping of countries looking east called \u0026lsquoaxis of the sanctioned\u0026rsquoKing Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312065.1595526228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says trade agreement unlikely between eu and uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson holding  crabs  at Stromness harbour during a visit to the Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles. Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

A senior group of Irish-American political and cultural leaders has urged Irish-Americans to boycott the sale of “Irish Lives Matter” T-shirts in the United States.Walmart and Amazon are selling a selection of T-shirts, some in green, emblazoned with the slogan – a rewording of the phrase Black Lives Matter that has become a rallying cry for racial justice in the United States following the death of African-American man George Floyd at the hands of white police officers in May.“While some may try to excuse such tee shirts as merely an exhibition of ethnic pride, we believe at best that they are tone deaf and insensitive, and at worst a deliberate, cynical attempt to trivialize, diminish or denigrate the BLM. We urge Irish Americans to boycott these sales,” the letter states.The Irish-American association, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, has also called out Amazon on stocking the products, accusing the company of insulting “two heritages for one low price”.“The hypocrisy of Mr. Bezos’ publicly virtue signaling on Amazon’s policy of respect and ersity while continually peddling prejudice for profit is cynically hypocritical,” the organisation said, referring to Amazon owner Jeff Bezos.Among the signatories of the letter sent to mark the passing of former congressman John Lewis are current members of Congress Joe Kennedy III, Richard Neal and Brendan Boyle, as well as former ambassadors, academic leaders and cultural figures including novelist Colm Tóibín.Northern Ireland linksOutlining the links between the American civil rights movement of the 1960s and the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in 1967, the letter outlines how senior figures in the peace process including John Hume drew inspiration from figures such as Martin Luther King jnr.The letter also recalls the 2014 visit of John Lewis to the island of Ireland, when he led a march over the peace bridge in Derry and delivered the Frederick Douglass address at Iveagh House in Dublin.“John Lewis is well remembered by our Irish American community for his staunch support for the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and all through the Troubles.”The letter notes that Irish America “still has much to learn about the depths of discrimination faced by our African American brothers and sisters. And we have our own history of racial prejudice that we must examine and acknowledge.”The letter comes amid new initiatives at higher-education institutions in the United States including Glucksman Ireland House and the Irish consulate in New York to highlight the Irish heritage of many African-Americans.Though precise figures are difficult to establish, it is estimated that up to 38 per cent of African-Americans have Irish ancestry.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"belgium luxembourg among brace countries covid rates may lead","story":"Luxembourg and Belgium are at risk of having quarantine reimposed by the Government as their coronavirus rates rise, an analysis by The  suggests.As the Government finalises its weekly review of air bridges, due on Friday, the analysis shows that both Luxembourg and Belgium have seen week-on-week rises in Covid-19 rates to post-lockdown peaks.At least four other countries have rising rates, with Croatia also on an unofficial watchlist following the travel chaos sparked when the Government reimposed quarantine on Spain at the weekend, upturning the holiday plans of up to 1.8 million Britons.On Tuesday, Boris Johnson warned of signs of a second wave of coronavirus in Europe as he defended the 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain.  Belgium has seen its weekly Covid-19 rate rise from 5.3 to 15.1 per 100,000 of the population since the beginning of July, with cases up from 615 to 1,751.The spike in infections has led to Belgium\u0027s government tightening social restrictions to contain the spread of coronavirus.Sophie Wilmes, the Belgian prime minister, said that, from Wednesday, a family or those living together can meet only the same five people from outside their household over the next four weeks. Antwerp has introduced a curfew.Luxembourg, which is bordered by Belgium to the north and west, has seen its weekly rates per 100,000 rise from 45.7 to 114.4, with the number of cases up from 286 to 716 in the same period. Use the interactive chart below to explore the infection rate across Europe:Other countries apparently at risk because of rising rates and post-lockdown peaks are the Bahamas, Monaco, Gibraltar and the Czech Republic. There is concern within the Government about Croatia, a major holiday destination for Britons, which is in the top 15 of the UK\u0027s list of quarantine-free countries with its rate of 12.4 per 100,000. This is, however, down on the previous week\u0027s.Mr Johnson said on Tuesday that the Government had to be swift in its response to spikes in coronavirus, and hinted at further action against other countries if necessary.Speaking during a visit to Nottinghamshire, the Prime Minister said: What we have to do is take swift and decisive action where we think that the risks are starting to bubble up again.Let\u0027s be absolutely clear about what\u0027s happening in Europe. Amongst some of our European friends, I\u0027m afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic.It came as the UK reported a further 119 coronavirus deaths – taking the official number of deaths so far to 45,878 – but the daily figure is typically higher on Tuesdays due to delays in reporting deaths at the weekend.Dr Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation (WHO) regional director for Europe, said there had been a slight uptick in new cases in the past couple of weeks in Europe as a result of an increasing number of countries experiencing localised outbreaks.He said this appeared to be driven by a higher proportion of new infections among young people who don\u0027t want to miss summer and were more likely to be mixing at parties, bars and clubs.They have a responsibility to themselves, parents, grandparents and communities. We do know how important good health behaviours are. Let\u0027s take advantage of that knowledge, he said.It comes as Heathrow\u0027s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, urged the Government to press ahead with airport tests of passengers for Covid-19 to help rescue summer and revive the economy.We need to find a way of getting \u0027red countries\u0027 opened up again. Testing is the only viable way of doing that in the absence of a vaccine, Mr Holland-Kaye told The  in an exclusive interview.A lot of countries which are red listed have millions of people who don’t have the disease and can’t travel. That’s holding back economic recovery.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"five eyes alliance looks expand reach counteract china influence","story":"The UK Government is said to be in talks to resurrect the Five Eye’s \u0027Critical Five\u0027 group to tackle supply dependency on China. Five Eyes is an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US. These countries are parties to the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence.It is understood that “feverish discussions” are in place to see one of the alliance’s bodies – which focuses on critical infrastructure such as communications and energy – sit again after a hiatus of five years.A source told The : “Clearly, everyone is panicked. They haven’t met for five years, but fears over supplies and our ability to secure ourselves have grown so great that the governments are resurrecting this historic body in order to tackle security together. “Many in the Government with long memories remember the early work of the Critical Five and see it as an oven-ready structure to address this challenge on a multilateral basis.” The Critical Five, which was created in 2012, defined critical infrastructure “as the systems, assets, facilities and networks that provide essential services and are necessary for the national security, economic security, prosperity, and health and safety of their respective nations”.However, it is thought that the members have not convened since 2015 because they could not all agree on six sectors they determined to be “critical infrastructure”. The sectors they did agree on to be critical were communications, energy, healthcare and public health, transportation systems  and water.  Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative Party leader, said the group’s resurrection was “the right thing to do”, but cautioned that it was “long overdue”.“It should have been sitting the whole time, it should have never stopped sitting in the first place, it should have been constantly on the game,” he told this newspaper.  Sam Armstrong, communications director for foreign policy thinktank the Henry Jackson Society, said: “Given how strategically dependent the UK has found itself to be on China, it is welcome that we are now working with our closest allies to unpick the worst excesses of this potential threat. Tackling a challenge as complex as China’s artificial dominance of great swathes of the world economy can’t be fixed without finally turning to our allies for help. It comes after Five Eyes is considering expanding its membership to include Japan. Such a move would see it strengthen into a strategic economic relationship that brings together critical mineral and medical supplies.It is understood that “advanced discussions” are underway about a new shared minerals security plan within Five Eyes, due to the gargantuan amount of rare and semi-rare minerals that are sourced from China, such as magnesium, which is used in products such as laptops and cameras, of which China is the leading producer.“There is a concern that, much like it did with Japan previously, it could threaten to cut off the supply of these goods ... which has the potential to cause a security risk,” the source added. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, has welcomed the prospect of Japan becoming the sixth member of Five Eyes. He said it was right that the group “should look at partners we can trust to deepen our alliances”.“Japan is an important strategic partner for many reasons and we should be looking at every opportunity to cooperate more closely,” he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hajj age coronavirus sterilised pebbles face masks no touching","story":"With just a smattering of pilgrims spaced two metres apart and slowly circling the Kaaba beneath coloured umbrellas in small groups, it was perhaps the most surreal Hajj in Islam’s 1,400 year-history. Before the coronavirus pandemic, millions of Muslims would travel to the holy city of Mecca in a spiritually and physically demanding tribute that each believer is expected to carry out at least once in their life. But on Wednesday, just a fraction of that number gathered at the Kaaba, wearing face masks and respecting social distancing rules in a muted version of Hajj that was designed to prevent the mass spread of the virus. Instead of standing shoulder-to-shoulder, Muslim pilgrims stayed two metres apart and were restricted to groups of around 20, identifiable by the colour of their umbrellas, which also warded off the baking Saudi Arabian heat. Touching the Kaaba, the cube-shaped focal point of the pilgrimage, was also forbidden. In response to the outbreak, Saudi Arabia has drastically changed the rules of the Hajj pilgrimage, restricting the number of attendees to just a thousand people, and only allowing Saudi residents to take part. Pilgrims were required to stay within their groups and eat prepackaged meals alone in their hotel rooms to prevent the transmission of the virus. Their movements within the holy city were also closely monitored by the authorities using electronic wristbands, while pilgrims are required to go into quarantine before and after the event. Usually, pilgrims pick up pebbles along the Hajj route that would then be used for the ritual of stoning the devil. Instead, pebbles were collected in bags and sterilised in advance. Hand sanitiser and soap were also in ample supply. All expenses were covered by the Saudi government, including healthcare for anyone who falls ill during the pilgrimage.  Words aren\u0027t enough to explain how blessed I feel and how amazing the arrangements have been, Ammar Khaled, a 29-year-old Saudi resident from India, told the Associated Press. They have taken every possible precaution,” he added. With people based overseas forbidden from joining Hajj, the 1,000 places for Saudi residents were hotly contested. Residents were required to fill out an application form, with around a third of the places reserved for Saudi security and medical staff. Applicants had to be between 20 and 50 years old with no terminal illnesses, and all were tested for coronavirus before they were allowed to take part. As many applications were rejected, there was some grumbling on Saudi social media once the results were announced, and some pilgrims said they had resisted the urge to announce their success on social media for fear of making their friends jealous. The Hajj follows a route the Prophet Muhammad walked nearly 1,400 years ago and is believed to trace the footsteps of the prophets Ibrahim and Ismail, or Abraham and Ishmael as they are named in the Bible.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russian scientists discover bones 10000 year old adult woolly","story":"Russian scientists are poring over the stunningly well-preserved bones of an adult woolly mammoth that roamed the earth at least 10,000 years ago, after local inhabitants discovered its remains in the shallows of a north Siberian lake.Part of its skull, several ribs and foreleg bones, some with soft tissue still attached to them, were retrieved from Russia\u0027s remote Yamal peninsula above the Arctic circle on July 23.Scientists are still searching the site for other bones.Similar finds in Russia\u0027s vast Siberian region have happened with increasing regularity as climate change warming the Arctic at a faster pace than the rest of the world has thawed the ground in some areas long locked in permafrost.Scientists circulated images in December of a prehistoric puppy, thought to be 18,000 years old, that was found in the permafrost region of Russia\u0027s Far East in 2018.The mammoth remains are at least 10,000 years old, although researchers don\u0027t yet know exactly when it walked the earth or how old it was when it died, said Dmitry Frolov, director of the Scientific Centre for Arctic studies.Researchers have found mammoth fossils dating from up to 30,000 years ago in Russia, he said.Yevgeniya Khozyainova, a scientist from a local museum, said it was unusual to find so many bones belonging to a single species and to know where they came from.Of course, we\u0027d like to find the remaining parts, to understand how complete a find it is.

The monument at Avebury is a Neolithic henge containing three stone circles, around the village of Avebury, Wiltshire.The breakthrough came when a piece of core – drilled from Stonehenge\u0027s Stone 58 during repair work in the 1950s – was returned to English Heritage from the US last year, which gave archaeologists the chance to analyse the chemical make-up without damaging the monument.English Heritage historian Susan Greaney said: The bluestones we\u0027ve known come from mid-west Wales from the 1920s, and they were easy to source because there are inclusions and quartz which you can match to the outcrop. The large stones are pretty uniform and just look like a big block, so it\u0027s difficult to interrogate them and find where they are from. The new research used X-ray spectrometry to look at the very small trace elements, and it was found the Stonehenge sarsens matched those in the Marlborough Downs. The sarsens average approximately 20 tonnes but can be as heavy  as 30, and the largest is 30 feet long. There are no sarsens of this size left in the downs, that\u0027s why it\u0027s been such a mystery and some people have suggested they come from elsewhere as you get outcrops in other places where you have chalkland, like Decon and Kent,” Ms Greaney added. The West Wood was overlooked because its under ancient woodland, and a lot of sarsens were removed in the 19th century for roadstones, particularly in Swindon, but there are still sarsens buried in amongst the trees.To be able to pinpoint the area that Stonehenge’s builders used to source their materials around 2,500 BC is a real thrill.While the Preseli stones were probably chosen for ritual or location reasons, the sarsens were likely to have been picked for their size, archaeologists believe. But although 10 times shorter than the journey from Wales, moving 30 tonne stones would still have proven a tricky prospect and the sarsens may have moved on the River Avon for part of the way.We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size – they wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find and it made sense to get them from as nearby as possible, said Ms Greaney. This is in stark contrast to the source of the bluestones, where something quite different – a sacred connection to these mountains perhaps – was at play. Yet again, this evidence highlights just how carefully considered and deliberate the building of this phase of Stonehenge was.Professor David Nash, a geomorphologist from the University of Brighton, said: It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries.”The team is now hoping to carry out more survey work on the Marlborough Downs, looking for sarsen chips and wedges which might indicate where the original location of the stones.The research was published in the journal Science Advances.In 2008, the X-ray spectrometry technique was used to visualise the paint below Vincent van Gogh\u0027s Patch of Grass and pick out the inidual brush strokes as well as the  flesh tones of the hidden head of a woman.Cornell University has also used it to analyse inscriptions from Greek and Roman pottery. Carvings that have been entirely worn away on the surface can still be visible through the tiny amount of iron left by a chisel, allowing words to emerge from seemingly smooth stone.In 2011, an unfinished self-portrait of Rembrandt was discovered under another painting using X-ray fluorescence.Conservation experts used the technique to understand the origins of the 1,400-year-old Staffordshire Hoard, a collection of more than 3,500 Anglo-Saxon artefacts discovered by a metal detector enthusiast in a field in Staffordshire in 2009.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us announces withdrawal 11000 troops delinquent germany","story":"The US has announced it is to withdraw nearly 12,000 troops from Germany, in a move Donald Trump said was intended to punish the “delinquent” Nato member for not spending enough on defence.The US president had declared his intention last month to cut by about a third the 36,000-strong US troop contingent in Germany, faulting its ally for failing to meet the alliance’s spending target and accusing it of taking advantage of America on trade.Of the troops leaving - a mix of Army and Air Force units - some 5,400 will be relocated to Italy and elsewhere in Europe, while 6,400 forces will be returned to the US and will in time redeploy to the continent.As part of the shakeup, which is estimated to cost billions of dollars, the US’s European Command headquarters and Special Operations Command Europe will also be moved from Stuttgart to Belgium.Germany\u0027s Defense Ministry refused to comment on the moves, saying the plans needed to be discussed internally first.Mark Esper, US Defence Secretary, cast the decision as a way to “enhance deterrence against Russia” and strengthen Nato.However, Mr Trump later told journalists: “they\u0027re not paying their bills. It\u0027s very simple. They\u0027re delinquent. He added that he might rethink the decision to pull troops out of Germany if they start paying their bills.“We don’t want to be the suckers anymore,” he said. “The United States has been taken advantage of for 25 years, both on trade and on the military.”The president has repeatedly accused Germany of failing to pay bills, which is a misstatement of the issue. Nato nations have pledged to dedicate 2 per cent of their gross domestic product to defense spending by 2024, and Germany is still short of that goal, at about 1.4 per cent.Defence officials too yesterday insisted that the decision as to where to house the US troops leaving Germany was not influenced by whether the new host country was meeting the two per cent target.Belgium and Italy, the two countries that will be receiving US troops from Germany, spend an even smaller percentage on defence than Berlin does.Members of the Republican Party have criticised the move as a gift to Russia and a threat to US national security. It remains to be seen if Congress would approve the funds for such a major relocation and if the plan would remain intact if Joe Biden, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is elected.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"western liberals covid myopia condemning worlds poorest","story":"Lockdown has polarised British society widening the gulf between the haves and have-nots, in a culture war yielding familiar tropes and characters. “Just stay at home, it’s not hard,” says the lawyer to the electrician. “Don’t sunbathe in the park!” cries Pandora from her Notting Hill townhouse. There is some truth in the caricature. But few have noted how the Pandora effect is also playing out on a monstrous global scale, inflicting unimaginable suffering. Around the world, lockdowns are pushing the already impoverished into outright destitution. Stay-at-home orders – bad enough for employees in countries with welfare states – become lethal for hand-to-mouth workers reliant on a daily income to survive. An estimated one billion people globally depend on money sent home from family members abroad, yet as millions have been laid off and confined, jobless, to their homes, remittances are projected to fall by a fifth this year in what the World Bank calls “the sharpest decline in recent history”. Environmentalists may rejoice at the plunge in air traffic, but the collapse in tourism has destroyed one highly effective way of transferring wealth from advanced economies to developing ones. Farmers in the developing world, unable to sell their produce, face ruin due to the destruction of global supply chains. Restrictions on movement, and a collapse in funding for humanitarian agencies, are blocking the distribution of aid to the neediest people on earth. Lockdown-associated economic turmoil is weighing particularly heavily on the young and vulnerable. In India, destitution is propelling desperate parents into the arms of human traffickers, with their false promises of lucrative jobs for children in mega-cities like New Delhi. According to the UN, Covid-linked malnutrition is causing the deaths of an additional 10,000 children a month. Tragically, lockdowns look set to kill many more youngsters than the virus itself.Such consequences, long predicted, are now too blatant to ignore. Yet the parochialism and narrow-mindedness of our debate has been extraordinary. Obsessing over the possibility of a second wave, our Government seems incapable of computing the economic consequences of not lifting lockdown, domestically and for the world beyond Europe. Despite the wildly differing circumstances, bodies such as the World Health Organisation have largely promoted the same, Western playbook of containment. Their advice ignores what should be core variables such as when stay-at-home orders mean confining millions in cramped, poorly sanitised conditions, or that the exorbitant human cost of an economic downturn will be greater with millions already below the poverty line. Even the comparatively young demographics of developing nations has been widely overlooked. There are alternatives to this clunky template. Primarily to avert economic meltdown, Pakistan rolled back many of its shutdown measures in a modified strategy designed to balance lives and livelihoods – an approach so far vindicated by falling case numbers. President Imran Khan has even broached the question of long-term coexistence with the virus – something few UK lawmakers have been bold enough to do.It may seem an odd concept, at a time of creeping poverty, but there is an air of luxury – even decadence – about our lockdown obsession. In a form of latter-day imperialism, countries that can afford to weather the economic storm (or believe they can) are demanding their model be imposed on impoverished countries for which it guarantees catastrophe. How ironic, yet how unsurprising, that Western liberals, immersed in identity politics and “check your privilege”, have ignored the unequal effects of lockdown on the global economy.It should require little imagination to perceive the colossal humanitarian harm of closing down entire societies and economies. Yet Covid myopia has blinded too many to the fact that decisions, policies and changes in consumer habits cannot be disentangled from the wider world. For months, those who raised such concerns have been shouted down by lockdown fanatics with cries of “one life is too many”. No longer. The developing world cannot afford to hunker down and await the virus’s eradication. Neither can we. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/21/15/5.-kiss-you-video-still.jpg","title":"celebrate 10 years of one direction with spotifys new platform experiences","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Calling all 1D stans!

A man on a neighbouring plot told the agency that the garden had not been used for the last two years.German authorities said last month they had identified a 43-year-old German citizen as a suspect in the case and are investigating him on suspicion of murder.Brueckner, 43, is currently in prison for drug dealing, and is appealing a conviction for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz. The attack happened a year and a half before Madeleine’s disappearance.Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has said Brueckner had a history of child sex offences and other crimes, including drug trafficking and burgling holiday apartments in Portugal.Having spent many years in Portugal since 1995, after fleeing a German prison sentence, he was last registered as living in the German city of Braunschweig, which is about 40 miles from Hanover.Scotland Yard has previously admitted Brueckner was among 600 people previously considered of potential significance during the McCann inquiry, but was not considered a suspect until a 2017 appeal unearthed new information.Additional reporting by PANo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Archaeologists have solved one of Stonehenge’s greatest mysteries — the precise source of the world-famous prehistoric temple’s largest stones.A new scientific breakthrough has, for the first time, allowed geologists to pinpoint almost exactly where Stonehenge’s giant stone uprights and lintels came from.Up until now, all that archaeologists knew with reasonable certainty was that the stones (a type of rock known as sarsen) had been brought in around 2500BC by the great temple’s Neolithic builders from the Marlborough Downs or immediately adjacent areas — a 75 sq miles area, 15-25 miles north of Stonehenge.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut now scientists from the University of Brighton have traced the stones to a small very specific two sq mile part of that range of hills — a patch of woodland just south of the village of Lockeridge, Wiltshire.In prehistoric and indeed later times, that area (now known as West Woods) seems to have been strewn with particularly large sarsen boulders, geochemically identical to those used to build Stonehenge.Humans reached Americas 11,000 years earlier than previously thoughtRecent detailed examination of the West Woods area by Reading University archaeologist, Katy Whitaker, suggests that the builders of Stonehenge probably chose it as their source of stone because of the exceptional sizes and relative flatness of many of its sarsen boulders.New archaeological research about the site has revealed that even 1200 years before Stonehenge was built, the West Woods area’s great sarsen slabs were used to construct a massive local prehistoric tomb.Now that the source of Stonehenge’s great stones has finally been identified, archaeological attention is likely to turn to discovering the precise route used by the monument’s prehistoric builders to move the giant 20-40tn stones from West Woods to Stonehenge (a distance of around 15 miles).There are two main options — an eastern route down the Wiltshire Avon Valley and a western route across Salisbury Plain.The western option would have involved a short segment where they would have had to haul the boulders up a 14 per cent gradient for around 300m.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut the eastern option would probably have involved hauling the giant stones (around 80 of them) for at least six miles along a river valley through relatively dense woodland and scrub. It would almost certainly not have been possible to use a raft on that river (the Wiltshire Avon) because the width of raft required to transport such large boulders would almost certainly have been much greater than the width of the river itself.On the balance of probabilities, it’s perhaps more likely that the builders of Stonehenge opted for the western route, despite the need to haul the stones up a hill.That route would have taken them south from West Woods across the southern part of the Marlborough Downs and down a very steep hill into the Vale of Pewsey. They would then have taken what was perhaps an already ancient trackway past (or indeed through) a huge prehistoric ritual and ceremonial complex (at Marden) across the river Avon and then up onto Salisbury Plain.It was that ascent onto Salisbury Plain, which involved the only moderately steep part of the journey (the 14 per cent gradient). Then they would have crossed the relatively flat and unforested plain to Stonehenge itself.If they did opt for this, on balance easier, western route, then the fact that they (and their massive stones) would have passed by or through the Marden ritual complex is potentially significant.In architectural terms, Stonehenge was destined to be the most impressive religious complex in Neolithic Britain — but Marden may well have been the biggest.Archaeological investigations over recent years (led by archaeologist, Dr Jim Leary, now of the University of York) have revealed that the Marden complex consisted of three great monuments — a vast 500m diameter banked enclosure north of the River Avon, a huge roughly 20m tall, 70m diameter ceremonial mound in the centre of that enclosure — and another banked enclosure, south of the river, surrounded by a 100m diameter circle of massive 1m diameter wooden “obelisks”.Having discovered the source of the giant stones of Stonehenge, archaeologists may soon be in in a position to make another potentially significant discovery about more than 100 fragments of sarsen stone found at Marden.In deploying the same scientific techniques used to pinpoint the source of the Stonehenge sarsens, scientists may ultimately be able to discover where the Marden fragments came from. Detailed preliminary examination of those enigmatic fragments will begin later this year.Those fragments appear to have been gathered together in the Marden ritual complex at around the same time that the Stonehenge sarsens may have been passing through that monument.So if it were ultimately to turn out that the Marden fragments came from West Woods, then it is conceivable that those fragments may have been removed from Stonehenge-bound sarsen boulders — potentially to shape them (and thus reduce their weight) prior to their ascent onto Salisbury Plain.Sarsen stone, the type of rock used to build Stonehenge and Avebury stone circle, may well have been regarded as profoundly mysterious by prehistoric people — because they normally only occur as loose or semi-buried boulders, completely unconnected to any bedrock. Indeed, the bedrock in the Marlborough Downs is chalk — so the presence (back in the Neolithic) of hundreds of thousands of often huge boulders composed of an obviously totally different type of stone (sometimes even arranged in straight lines across the landscape) would have been seen by prehistoric people as unusual.Worldwide, anomalous stones have often been regarded by many cultures as spiritually and physically interchangeable with humans — sometimes with a belief that particular stones contained the souls, spirits or even the transformed mortal remains of the dead. The belief was widespread, occurring on virtually every continent.It is likely therefore that the builders of Stonehenge, Avebury and other stone circles perceived sarsen in both practical construction terms and also in more spiritual ones.In geological terms, sarsen is just a very hard sandstone. It was formed around 50 million years ago when fresh groundwater gradually deposited additional silica while flowing through sand deposits. In some places, that silica then acted as a natural “glue” to bind trillions of sand grains together, thus forming solid rock.When later erosion subsequently removed the surrounding “unglued” (ie loose) sand, all that was left were the sarsen boulders.Because the chemicals in the original sand varied from locality to locality, modern scientists have now been able to develop a way of producing very accurate chemical fingerprints for sarsen stones from different locations. The system has been developed by University of Brighton geomorphologist and geographer, Professor David Nash. He has now used it to solve the mystery of where Stonehenge’s sarsens came from. It’s the first time that sarsen “fingerprinting” has been used to solve a major archaeological puzzle. The new British Academy funded research is being published today by the American on-line free-access journal Science Advances.“It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries,” said Professor Nash.“We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size,” said English Heritage senior properties historian Susan Greaney.‘Astonishing’ discovery of ancient monument next to Stonehenge“The builders of Stonehenge wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find,” she added.As well as the giant sarsen stones, Stonehenge also has a significant number of much smaller stones (the so-called bluestones). Over the years, scientists have succeeded in demonstrating that those smaller (2-3tn) standing stones were brought by Stonehenge’s builders from southwest Wales.Professor Nash was able to analyse the Stonehenge sarsens because a core extracted from one of the monuments giant stones during repair work in the 1950s (and taken to America by one of the engineers involved in that work) was returned to English Heritage last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Activists are working to save the 4,000 goats at a farm where workers were caught brutally attacking the animals in a scandal that led to three people being sacked.Animal-rights group Surge is also pressing farm bosses to accept help in switching to farming plants instead of goats.The owner of Far Marsh Farm in East Yorkshire told The Independent it may have to shut down after secret camera footage revealed workers inflicting agonising injuries on the animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGoats were punched, hit with a pole, dragged by their ears and slammed down, leaving some so crippled they struggled to stand up.The farm is one of a number that supplied goat milk to St Helen’s Farm, the UK’s biggest goat-milk brand, before The Independent exposed the cruelty.Farm at centre of goat cruelty scandal may have to close, owners sayMarks \u0026amp Spencer and all the big supermarkets except Morrisons said they pulled from sale St Helen’s products, including milk, cheese and butter, after seeing the footage.Surge, which obtained the footage – filmed last month – says it has secured spaces at animal sanctuaries for 42 of Far Marsh Farm’s goats, and is appealing to people who could home others to join a rescue operation.The group also wants supporters to contact St Helen’s to lobby for the goats to be handed over.The activists are working with a company that specialises in helping dairy farmers to switch to producing plant milk and convert their land into sanctuaries.The company, Refarm’d, is offering to use the farm infrastructure to set up “vertical” farms – where plants are grown on suspended shelves in stacks. Advocates of vertical farming say benefits include eliminating run-off of polluted water and reducing food air miles.Goats punched, hit and ‘left lame’ at farm supplying supermarket milkThe video footage showed goats at Far Marsh Farm crying out in pain as they were held by their necks, had their ears tagged or had their tails twisted.

We are horrified. We had no idea this was going on. If we had known, we would have stopped it instantly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

He returns to SIS with tremendous experience and will oversee the work of a group of men and women whose tireless efforts are rarely seen in public, but which are critical for the security and prosperity of the UK.“I pay tribute to Sir Alex Younger for everything he has done during his time leading the Secret Intelligence Service.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A gridlock in the UK’s visa processing system has left people unable to work or travel to see dying relatives during the pandemic despite being legally resident, prompting renewed criticism of the Home Office’s privatised visa service.Hundreds and possibly thousands of foreign nationals have been left in a “state of limbo” after being informed that although visa centres have reopened, they must continue to wait before they can proceed with submitting their biometrics.Foreign nationals in the UK are required to submit their biometric information, such as fingerprints, in order to obtain a visa. This process usually takes place in centres across the country run by firm Sopra Steria, which is contracted by the Home Office to deliver the service.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBefore the private company took over the contract last year, applicants could go to their local post office to provide biometric data. Under Sopra Steria’s service, they must attend one of six “core centres” across the country that offer a free service, or one of another 51 that usually charge a fee starting from £69.99.However, these centres were closed in March because of the lockdown, putting the process on hold. A phased reopening of the centres began on 1 June, but nearly two months on, many applicants are still “in limbo”.People left without proof of UK status as visa centre fees soarAt the start of July, the Home Office informed applicants who had previously applied for UK visas that they would be put through a new process which would reuse biometrics they had submitted previously, and that therefore they could not book an appointment at one of the visa centres. But there has been no update since on when this new process will begin.Meanwhile, first-time applicants, who can still book appointments, have found that there are no free appointments being offered by Sopra Steria, despite the fact that all core centres are supposed to provide slots without charge. This has left some unable to afford to submit their biometrics, or having to travel long distances to do so.David Pountney, senior solicitor at Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), told The Independent there would be hundreds, if not thousands, of people in this situation.“Without having that current, valid immigration document, people run into difficulties. People don’t have the documents and they don’t have anything else they can use to prove their right to be here,” he said.“Although in theory an employer or a landlord could contact the Home Office to check their immigration status, they’re not likely to, and even if they do, the Home Office sometimes get it wrong.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Pountney said the lack of clarity around the new system of reusing biometrics was making it “impossible” to advise clients: “Clients keep asking us when something is going to happen, and we just don’t know. We’ve got no clarity on who is likely to be covered by this new system or what the process is, so we have to play it by ear.”Andrew Tingley, partner and head of immigration at Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP, said: “Thousand of applicants are currently in limbo as a result of the Home Office policy of allowing the re-use of biometrics.” He argued that visa applicants should be given the choice on whether to opt into the new system of reusing biometrics.Filipino national Sharon Phillips, 32, moved to the UK in December 2019 to join her husband Hywel on a six-month finance visa. They married in February and applied for her spouse visa in May, but the closure of visa centres meant she couldn’t submit her biometrics at the time.The couple assumed that once the centres opened in June, they would be able to continue with the process, but they are still waiting – and until Sharon obtains her spouse visa, she is unable to work.Sharon, who worked as a domestic worker in Malaysia before she came to the UK, said: “It’s frustrating. I can’t work. I can’t travel. I can’t do anything right now. I was hoping to work in a care home. I know there are vacancies in care homes at the moment. I want to, but what do I do?“Financially I don’t have anything right now. I’m totally reliant on my husband. He’s also supporting my family back home in the Philippines.“I’m just at home. I have nothing to look forward to. I’m hoping none of my family get sick because if that happens, I won’t be able to go back home to see them. We’re just waiting and waiting. I’m just stuck in limbo.”Hywel, 31, who met Sharon while studying in Malaysia, said: “It’s hard to believe that they shut down all visa processing for three months, when it’s such an essential service. And it looks like there was no forward thinking about how to deal with the backlog once it reopened.“We’ve been trying to wait patiently, but there’s so much uncertainty. We’ve now been told we have to go down this path of reusing biometrics, but it’s a new system that hasn’t been tested, and there’s no date for it yet. Will it be one more month? Will it be three more months? We really don’t know how long this will take.”Emre and Elif Gunes said they were feeling “desperate” because, as a result of the delays, they have been unable to travel to Turkey to visit Elif’s father, who has cancer and has been in a critical state since 13 July.The Turkish couple, both of whom work as engineers in the UK, applied for an extension in April as the visas were set to expire on 19 June, but – although the process should normally take a few weeks – they still haven’t been able to submit their biometrics in order to complete the process.They were hopeful when Sopra Steria announced on 1 June that appointments would be allocated by the order of the application submission dates, but they have since been told that they will be going through the new process of reusing previously submitted biometrics, and have been given no time frame as to when it will be up and running.Elif, 29, said: ”I feel guilt and desperation every second of every day knowing that my family needs my support more than ever before, but I cannot promise them I will be there soon. This adds another unbearable dimension to my existing sorrow and fears.“My heart beats fast whenever my phone rings, not only because I am scared to hear any more bad news about my father’s situation but also I do not know what is going to happen to my job and life here if I choose to go home. Do I have to leave my job and life behind just because this visa extension process is not working properly? This is the pressure I am under constantly.”Emre, 31, said that on top of the distress of being unable to see his father-in-law, he was concerned about losing his job and, in the current situation, being unable to find a new one: “It was already too much stress for me. What I am going to do if I lose my job due to the pandemic? Will it be possible to find a new job with sponsorship?”Debasish Dash, a mathematician who has been working in the UK since 2016, has been unable to take up a job as a lecturer at Strathclyde University, which he was supposed to start at the beginning of July, because it has not been possible for him to complete the visa process.The 33-year-old Indian national, who applied for a Global Talent Visa – which the government introduced in February to attract “talented and promising iniduals in specific sectors” – is currently working at Cambridge University in a job that he was supposed to have left a month ago. The university has been able to source additional research funding for him to continue, but this will end in August.“I will be unemployed. Researchers are not paid a lot. Because of the government’s mistake I’ll have to dig into my savings and start paying my rent and my bills from my savings. It just makes no sense,” he said.“It’s nonsense. Everything was in place for me to start the new job in July, but now I don’t know how long I will have to wait because the government is not telling us anything.“Banks and post offices were open. Why were visa centres closed for two months? Even since they’ve opened, why is there a complete lack of urgency? They’re very slow and they’re giving us no time frame. They’re trying to attract talented people, yet they’re putting me through this stress.”Another Indian national, who didn’t want to be named, said he was afraid to go outside in case anyone in authority requested to see his residence permit, which he is currently unable to provide because his visa ran out on 30 May, and he hasn’t been able to process his new one because has been told to wait for the new biometrics service.The 25-year-old, who moved to the UK in January 2017 and works in the IT sector, said: “I find it tough to go out because police may ask for your permit to stay in the UK and I don’t have that. I’ve hardly been out in the last two months.“I’m worried. I don’t have any proof of my status to show I’m eligible to be in this country. I can’t do anything. It’s important to have freedom and to have a visa to show you’re allowed to be in this country. What we’re going through is something no one is noticing.”The young man said he was also distressed by the fact that his sister had recently given birth to her first child in India, and he had been unable to travel to see his family.A Sopra Steria spokesperson said: “We recognise it has been a difficult time for people unable to access appointments because of the global pandemic.”They confirmed that the firm was looking to introduce new measures involving the reuse of fingerprint biometrics that have been recorded in a previous application, and said more information would be provided on this “very soon”.The spokesperson said that since the phased reopening of centres on 1 June, the company had made “significant” progress in reducing the number of customers waiting for an appointment and was working to release new appointments.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on some visa services as we operate with a reduced capacity to observe social distancing. We’ve adapted our working practices in order to clear applications as soon as possible, which includes reusing the fingerprint biometrics of some of our customers to re-enrol and stop people having to attend in person.”UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Zuckerberg may be lying before congress after the Facebook CEO said he wasn\u0027t aware of any instance in which someone was fired for their political beliefs.When asked why Oculus Rift founder Palmer Luckey was fired, Zuckerberg wouldn\u0027t comment on specific personnel.I\u0027ve seen the messages where you have specifically directed Mr Luckey to make statements regarding his politics for the benefit of your company so I think both in the case of these content moderators and in the case of the testimony you just gave regarding Mr Luckey, and firing people over their politics, there is serious question as to whether or not you\u0027re giving truthful testimony here or whether it\u0027s lying before congress, Mr Gaetz said.\u0026nbspZuckerberg dodges questions from Matt Gaetz on Project Veritas expose showing Facebook content moderators that spoke about the culture in Facebook that disadvantages conservatives and leads to content manipulation.I\u0027m somewhat familiar with

have some of their own goals some of the time, and it\u0027s our job running the company to make sure that we minimize errors and that we make sure that the company\u0027s operations reflect the principles that we intend to run it on.\u0026nbspZuckerberg confirms Facebook previously had policies to restrict competitors in response to an email exchange between company product managers discussing restricting Pinterest but not Netflix.We used to have a policy that restricted competitors from using our platform and Pinterest is a social competitor with us, it\u0027s one of the many

CNN said congresswoman Pramila Jayapal cited an anonymous Amazon employee’s testimony that there is a rule against using such data, but that it is not enforced, describing the situation as a “candy shop”.Bezos acknowledged there was a policy that prohibited the use of third-party seller data to support Amazon’s own private-label business.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said.

There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She speaks to Oliver Carroll\u0026nbspahead of next week\u0027s electionThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Over the next two weeks, Alexander Lukashenko faces the fight of his life. It was never supposed to be like this – not in Belarus. Not with a self-styled dictator who has previously declared election victories with 75.6 per cent, 82.6 per cent, 79.65 per cent, and 84.14 per cent of the vote. Not with a sophisticated system of modern authoritarianism, one that made independent political activity the preserve of the brave and foolhardy. This time around, the regime did all the things it usually does. Election officials refused to register the three strongest challengers from the field. Out went Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the US, Viktor Babariko, a banker, and Sergei Tikhanovski, advertising entrepreneur and popular political blogger. The latter two were arrested and jailed for their troubles. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBelarus headed for election confrontation as Lukashenko cracks downDespite all that, the 9 August election is gearing up to be the political story of the summer. Battered by criticism over his Covid-19 denialism, the five-term incumbent Lukashenko appears to be in real trouble: regularly upstaged by opposition forces, with unprecedented protests taking place across the country. Even more embarrassing for the macho leader who claims the presidency is “too much for a woman” to handle, his most obvious nemesis is female. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the wife of jailed Sergei Tikhonovsky, was propelled into politics following the arrest of her husband in May. A former translator, secretary and, for the last 10 years, a shy, stay-at-home mum, she tells The Independent she is no politician. She spent much of the last year persuading her “opinionated” husband to do what everyone else in the country did – lie low. She says she anguished as she witnessed surveillance and arrests step up in line with Sergei’s YouTube popularity and informal campaign around the end of last year. But Ms Tikhanovskaya says she knew she had “no right” to stop her husband, and the last time he was arrested, vowed to continue his work. She registered as a candidate. Extraordinarily for a declared opposition candidate in Belarus, she was allowed to run. Defying predictions the opposition would find it difficult to unite, Ms Tikhanovskaya snapped to common language with Maria Kolesnikova, the head of Viktor Barbariko’s presidential campaign, and Veronika Tsepkalo, wife of Valery, the other barred candidate. The basics of an agreement were hammered out in 15 minutes, and a full oral understanding in under a couple of hours. As the registered candidate, Ms Tikhanovskaya would lead the campaign platform. There would be just three pledges: to free political prisoners, reverse authoritarian changes to the constitution made in 1996, and to run new, free elections within six months. The three women announced their decision with a photoshoot: Ms Tikhanovskaya appeared with a clenched fist, flanked by Ms Tsepkalo with a “V” for victory sign and Ms Kolesnikova, with a heart. The symbolism was “spontaneous”, Ms Tikhanovskaya insists, and one of the very few things the group committed to paper. “Don’t think it was some campaign prepared months ago. It was all about the situation we found ourselves in.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAlexander Lukashenko cannot survive as president of BelarusCoronavirus spreads rapidly in Belarus as leader denies it existsFor some, the optics were too perfect. The instant agreement. The women leaders. The fact Ms Tikhanovskaya was registered in the first place. Elements of the Belarusian opposition converged with an unusual ally, Mr Lukashenko, in blaming the invisible hand of Moscow – an ungraspable law of nature in these parts. Those who wanted evidence found it easily enough. Viktor Babariko made his money as a manager for a bank owned by Russia’s Gazprom. Valery Tsepkalo retains links with the Belarusian elite – and fled to Russia with his children shortly after his non-registration. Nationalistic opponents of Sergei Tikhanovsky have also criticised his production contracts with Russian stars. Ms Tikhanovskaya rejects the criticism as “silly rumours” that are “impossible to engage with”. She couldn’t speak on behalf of the other campaign teams, but as far as her husband was concerned, she was “more than sure” of his propriety. She saw how he had “looked for kopecks” to pay for petrol while campaigning. If they were Russian agents, they’d have a bit more cash in the bank, she reasoned. Mr Tikhonovski was a leader in protests against closer integration with Russia, and spent 30 days in prison for his trouble: “We know all about Lukashenko’s road maps with Russia, which will slowly but surely lead to full unification. Ask yourself who the pro-Russian candidate really is.”  Ms Tikhanovskaya has grown in self-assurance since the unexpected start to her political career. In conversation with The Independent, she delivers weighted positions that disguise the lack of formal political experience. On Russia, the policy was to be “friends with everyone” – but reduce dependence on oil and gas handouts. On the “painful” subject of Crimea, “de jure” it was Ukrainian, “de facto” Russian, and she wouldn’t drive people further apart by committing to either. She would stay middle of the road on the most controversial social issues like gay marriage: “I’m totally fine with same-sex relations and think any love is wonderful, but perhaps our country isn’t ready for a decision on this just yet.” Ms Tikhanovskaya’s campaign has not shied from taboos. As a registered candidate she was allowed a short broadcast on state TV, and she used it to extraordinary effect. For the first time in many years, viewers were told about political prisoners and arrests. She attacked the president’s Covid-19 denialism and alleged low ratings. Quite how popular the president is is unclear, given that independent polling is illegal in Belarus. One unofficial online poll had him at 3 per cent. That figure is likely to be highly misleading given the president’s historical electoral base. But it has become somewhat of an opposition slogan, and was unwittingly amplified by the president himself when he complained about “3 per cent” Lukashenko jokes. On this, as on much else, the old-fashioned autocrat has found himself behind the curve of modern social media and meme culture. David Marples, a professor at the University of Alberta, Canada, and long time Belarus watcher, suggests that a free vote could be quite evenly split. “Coronavirus and economic problems have conspired to undermine a belief Lukashenko can deliver,” he says. For most of his time in office, the president kept his side of an “unspoken contract” – good pensions and living standards in exchange for political submission. Now, the model is broken. “There is no obvious or honest way for Lukashenko to get the 65 per cent any respectable dictator needs,” Mr Marples says. “It’s the beginning of the end for him – perhaps not in two weeks time, but not far beyond. The fear has gone.” In a sign of increasing nervousness, Belarus’s long time leader has started to to hint at the use of force. On Friday, he said he had “learned the lessons of 2010”, when protests erupted following his claimed overwhelming victory, and were suppressed with the help of riot police. “I understand the need to have well-prepared soldiers ready just in case,” he said. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who has evacuated her children out of Belarus, tells The Independent that there wasn’t a moment where she didn’t feel “very, very frightened”. But it was a fear the whole county shared, she insists. “I hope they will listen to their people – and never, ever send in the tanks or soldiers,” she says. “We don’t want blood, we just want change.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But time is getting short now.”A former friend said Christian B fantasised about creating a Josef Fritzl-style dungeon at his home.Christian B’s pal said: “He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.”The sex offender allegedly revealed his fantasy to a pal while living in the German city of Brunswick after ing to his home country from Portugal.Christian Bs pal – who wanted to remain anonymous – led a TV crew to the house where the twice convicted paedophile was living around .He alleged that the now -year-old German had confided in him that he dreamed of turning the cellar of his rented home into a basement liar.Christian B is said to have wanted to create a dungeon like the one Fritzl built with soundproof walls.There is no evidence to suggest the suspect ever followed through on this idea.Christian Bs pal said: “He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.”Madeleine would now be  years old.She was born May , , and went missing a little more than a week before her fourth birthday.Prior to the th anniversary of her disappearance, the McCanns said in an update on their FindMadeleine website: #It is now  years since we were last with Madeleine.#Her th birthday is to follow in the next couple of weeks# the latter tangibly, painfully, bringing it home to us what we have missed and continue to miss as a family.#The investigation to find Madeleine remains open and continues, even though, in a way dferent to the ideal.#We remain grateful for the ongoing efforts and commitment from all those involved in the search to find her and we hope and pray, as always, that our efforts will be fruitful.#Thank you to everyone still offering their support and good wishes for Madeleine and ourselves.#Such solidarity continues to strengthen us.#Investigators were seen pushing a skip onto a fork lt on the land in Seelze, Hanover.Police investigators have been pictured holding drones as they continue the search on Christian Bs allotment in Hanover.Locals near the site of Christian Bs former allotment site where he is said to have lived in a caravan say they saw ers nearby. A e team was reportedly spotted searching the River Leine in the nearby town of Seelze. The river is located at the back of the former property.Wolfgang Kossak, , who owns the plot next to Christian Bs, said many of the plots were sub-let.He recalled the suspect as a stranger who “caused a lot of trouble” visiting the site around .Christian B #had the garden next to mine# and he #arrived in  and left within a year#, he said.#He told me that he living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there,# Mr Kossak told the MailOnline.“Christian is remembered for selling weed when he lived here. The block where he lived always stunk of cannabis, he was the local dealer.”The plot is four miles from his last known address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.He rented a garage at Euro Hobbywerkstatt in Hannover # a few miles down the road from the allotment currently being excavated by German police. He was ­nicknamed “the ­screwdriver” because he always smelled of oil and petrol.The extensive search at the site near Hanover, Germany, began after another allotment holder at the site tipped off cops after watching a Crimewatch TV show. The show features a range of unsolved crimes which included Madeleines case.Christian B previously boasted to the owner of an allotment he rented in Braunschweig, northern Germany, that he wanted to put perspex glass over a hole in the ground at her site.The search of the site # currently in its third day # is due to continue for another two days, cops confirmed.Dozens of officers are taking part in the hunt for clues that might solve one of the worlds most infamous crimes.British police officers are also taking part in the investigation and have reportedly already quizzed a garage owner who rented a workspace to Christian B.Around  officers are continuing to work on the scene of the plot of land once used by suspect Christian B.An area of trees has been cleared and a mini excavator has been used to dig the land.A total of three skips have been taken away for the material to be examined, Sky News reports.A range of tools from metal detectors to ground-penetrating radar equipment and snfer dogs are all being utilised in the search. #They have dug a big hole here, around  metres long and  to ft deep,# Sky reporter Martin Brunt said from the scene.#They are sting and raking through the piles of soil that have been tipped around the edge of that hole and the excavator is now filling the hole.#German police discovered what may have been a basement or a hidden cellar room in the remains of the foundations of a building in the allotment where kidnapping suspect Christian B allegedly lived in , Bild.de reports.Neighbours say the wooden shed was demolished in late  or  – months after Madeleine disappeared.Investigators have been removing slabs of building materials and large square stones were also excavated from the site.Wolfgang Kossack, , who owns the plot adjacent told MailOnline: #At the time there was a building on the garden. It was a small wooden structure with only one room to keep tools and other things but it had a kitchen. #The building was not really a house, you might call it a shed. But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations. This building was destroyed in .#The first photos of what might have been discovered in Christian Bs garden lot has been revealed.

A source close to German investigators admitted “momentum had been lost” in the probe.German prosecutors had boasted that Christian B was their man and they had #concrete evidence# Madeleine was dead.“In an investigation of this kind the first few weeks after the suspect’s name is released are absolutely vital,” our source told The Sun Online. “Detectives remain convinced Christian B was involved in Madeleine’s disappearance but they still need that crucial part of the jigsaw.#THE prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case was called from a phone linked to a paedophile on the night she vanished.Christian B spent  minutes on the mystery call.A Brit private investigator found the number was once linked to another German paedo.Former cop Mark Williams-Thomas, who exposed Jimmy Savile, said: “It is hugely signicant that a paedophile operating in Germany on the dark web, discussing and exchanging child abuse material, held the number that called B.“It is a huge coincidence that the user is — like B — German and also uses the dark web to discuss the sexual abuse of children. The question that now needs answering is did the suspect hold that number in  “And,he did, what were two dangerous paedophiles discussing in a call an hour or so before Madeleine disappeared.”The man who owned the allotment next to Christian B said he once told him he was #living off the grid.#Wolfgang Kossack, , said he only realised the link to suspect when cops started digging up the land.#He told me that he was living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there,# he told the Mail Online.#He never did any gardening. He did not plant anything or try to grow anything. He just sat around drinking beer.#Police are using tools ranging from excavators, shovels and snfer dogs to investigate the plot.It is now the third day of the search in Seelze, near Hannover, believed to be in connection with the  Portugal disappearance of Madeleine McCann.German police officers were seen leaving the digging site with ground radar specialist equipment.Ground-penetrating radar is an instrument used in order to detect electromagnetic contrasts in the soil.It contains antenna to send and detect electromagnetic waves at given frequencies to detect subsurface objects and changes in material properties.When the energy encounters a buried object or a boundary between materials it can be reflected or scattered back to the surface. Police carry a container towards the site where they started digging in an allotment area in Seelze, near Hannover, Germany.Suspect, Christian B, is said to have lived there for a while some years ago.The plot is four miles from Christian Bs last known fixed address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.The suspect is said to have been living at the site in around  or  in a caravan after ing from Portugal, Haz.de reports.An unnamed source told Bild that Christian B had once lived on the site in a caravan for a short while.One neighbour was said to have recognised him from the photo, and recalled seeing his yellow and white VW Camper van, which German police last month appealed for information on.They added Christian B was often seen with the VW at the allotment where he also had two dogs and where he had often rowed with locals.German police searching a garden today on the outskirts of Hannover, northern Germany, are using excavators, snfer dogs, shovels and rakes to investigate the plot. Investigators put up two tents and continued to dig even further into the ground after they had cut down trees and bushes earlier this week, the German news agency dpa reported.Prosecutors did not say what the investigators were looking for. At the garden plot, investigators even removed parts of the foundation of a former cabin from the ground that once stood there, dpa reported. A man on a neighbouring plot told the news agency that the garden, where blackberry bushes and a cheery tree grow, had not been used for the last two years.The site was previously home to a German suspect linked to Madeleines disappearance.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged.

Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask.

German researchers now claim they have trained dogs who can also detect coronavirus from someones saliva. The potentially ground-breaking study was piloted by the University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover, the Hanover Medical School and the German Armed Forces.They found that,properly trained, dogs were able to discriminate between human saliva samples infected with SARS-CoV- and non-infected samples with a whopping success rate of  per cent overall.There is hope that this could help prevent further outbreaks due to the rapid nature of the testing. It could also lead to instant testing at sporting events and airports, allowing countries to scrap some quarantining measures and empty stadium rules.To conduct the study, researchers trained eight dogs from Germanys Armed Forces for one week. The trained canines snfed the saliva of more than , people that were either healthy or infected with the virus. Samples infected with Covid- were distributed at random and neither the animal handlers nor the researchers on site knew which ones were positive.In a Youtube video on the project, Maren von Koeckritz-Blickwede, a professor at the university who conducted the study, says researchers think dogs can do this because the internal processes of an infected person completely change.She said: We think that the dogs are able to detect a specic smell of the metabolic changes that occur in those patients.Ms Von Koeckritz-Blickwede says the next step is to train dogs to dferentiate Covid- samples from other diseases like the flu, while other research will also need to be carried out.

What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people.The Spanish flu pandemic - the deadliest outbreak of the virus in history - emerged in March  with the hallmarks of a seasonal virus.As it coincided with the First World War, the virus spread through army troops from across the globe.  Cases appeared to drop off over the summer - and there was hope at the beginning of August  that the virus had run its course.But from September to November of that year, the death rate skyrocketed and unlike the first wave, this strain affected young, healthy people too.Experts describe it as W curve - where there are high numbers of deaths among the very young and old, as well as a huge spike in the middle, with otherwise healthy  to -year-olds being struck down.The pandemic ended by the summer of , as those had been infected around the world had either died or developed immunity, according to History.In , scientists revealed that they had solved the mystery of how the Spanish started and why it became so deadly.A study by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that people born after  had not been exposed to the kind of virus which devastated the world in .This explains why the deadly pandemic largely targeted young adults while older patients, who had built up some immunity, would often make a full recovery, reports National Geographic.Prof Kirby stressed that people who are overweight may also be at a higher risk of a second wave of coronavirus.He said: We do have a massive problem with weight in this country and we do need to address it. A message that came from this conference to patients all over the world isyou want to protect yourself against the second wave that is coming down the track then getting fit and losing weight is absolutely crucial.Earlier this week, the Government announced its strategy to tackling the obesity crisis in the UK.The new “Better Health” campaign, run by Public Health England, calls on everyone to “embrace a healthier lestyle”.Supported by the NHS, the scheme will allow GPs to refer more patients to the likes of WeightWatchers.GPs will also prescribe exercise, such as cycling and gym classes, and patients will be given access to weight loss apps.Staff in doctors’ surgeries will also be trained as “healthy weight coaches” to give people advice on how to stay trim.Meanwhile, shops will be banned from offering Buy One Get One Free deals on junk food and placing treats near store entrances and tills.Large restaurants, cafes and takeaways must put calorie labels on menus, so customers can make informed choices.And adverts for food high in fat, sugar or salt will be axed from TV and websites before the pm watershed.Ministers will consult on expanding this to cover all times of day and night.Health charities last night welcomed the “world-leading” plans.But critics said it will push up food prices and see cash-strapped families losing out on supermarket bargains.Evidence of a link between obesity and increased risk from Covid was a “wake-up call” to ministers.Mr Johnson has lost over a stone by exercising and watching his food since his brush with the virus. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People have been asked to work from home where possible, avoid unnecessary travel, and socially distance. The government also banned gatherings of more than  people, banned visits to nursing home, and closed secondary schools and universities. Primary schools have stayed open, in part to ensure more healthcare workers could continue going to work. At the peak of the outbreak, the country was seeing , cases of coronavirus diagnosed per day, but that figure has now fallen into double digits. There has been speculation that the lighter-touch approach will allow Swedens population to develop herd immunity, but the extent to which recovered coronavirus patients enjoy immunity remains uncertain. Speaking to reporters in Stockholm on Tuesday, Tegnell said: The curves go down, and the curves over the seriously ill begin to be very close to zero. As a whole, it is very positive.He also addressed the question of face masks, which the World Health Organisation continues to recommend people use when social distancing isnt practicable. “With numbers diminishing very quickly in Sweden, we see no point in wearing a face mask in Sweden, not even on public transport,” he said.Swedens death toll, currently ,, has been high in comparison to neighbouring countries of a similar size. None of Denmark, Norway, or Finland, each with a population roughly half that of Sweden, have seen their tolls rise above ,. Many of the European countries that have begun to reopen their borders to foreign visitors are still yet to allow entry to people travelling from Sweden. The countrys healthcare system also initially struggled to cope with the impact of the virus, with  people at one point being admitted to intensive care every day, though that figure has now fallen to only a handful of people each week. In cases per capita, Sweden now has a similar rate of infection to the UK, and its government has argued that its strategy will be easier to maintain in the long-term. Speaking to Euronews this week, Jan Albert, a professor of infectious disease control at the Karolinska Institute and the author of a recent study on coronavirus in Sweden, said that the issue of herd immunity remained a big unknown. There are so many unknown factors about how many actually develop antibodies and other types of immune responses after going through the disease, and how many will be required to have had the disease in order to see herd immunity, he said. Speaking to Unherd about his countrys response last week, Tegnell said: “It is better to have a more complete discussion around this in say  months, after next summer.

The way this kind of scam works is businesses will create fake customer accounts, buy their own products, and send them to your home.While the online customer accounts may be fake, the addresses are legitimate. This means that the mischievous sellers can now use those accounts to register real deliveries, post nice product reviews, and improve their rankings on e-commerce sites like Amazon or eBay.CBS News confirmed that residents in all  states have now reported receiving suspicious packages of seeds.No one really knows for sure, though USDA is collecting seed packages from recipients and testing their contents.The agency will determinethey contain anything that could be of concern to US agriculture or the environment.In the meantime, authorities strongly advised those who received the seeds to not plant them.Instead, report it to USDA and maintain the seeds and packaging until USDA instructs you what to do with the packages and seeds.The seeds may be needed as evidence.Agriculture officials in the states below have issued warnings about the seeds, according to NBC News.Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington state, West Virginia and Wyoming.Meanwhile on Reddit, people are determined to find out the kind of seeds.Some say the seeds say they look citrus-y and a lot like lemon seeds.

According to one measure, the number of positive tests each day has risen % since the start of the month.That will worry many people as more rules are lted on August  - with people in England encouraged to go back to work, and the vulnerable no longer needing to shield. So what do the statistics say  We look a few of the figures that will be worrying the PM - and the nation. Boris Johnson said yesterday: Clearly we now face, Iaposm afraid, the threat of a second wave in other parts of Europe and we just have to be vigilant and we have to be very mindful.A Downing Street source later told the Daily Mail : The PM is extremely concerned by what heaposs seeing abroad and fears we could be seeing the same thing here in a fortnight.A No spokesman declined to comment today on the report in the Mail. But askedthere could be a second wave in the UK in two weeks, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Breakfast: There is always a risk. We have been clear all along that there is a risk. Hereaposs why they could be worried. . New case numbers are no longer falling in England  The number of new coronavirus cases is no longer falling in England, official figures showed on Friday. The Office for National Statistics announced a steady decline in number of people testing positive for Covid- over recent months has now levelled off.The watchdog estimated that in the week to July , around one in , people in had coronavirus in the community in England. The previous weekaposs bulletin put the figure at one in ,.And there were an estimated , new cases per day, compared with , the previous week.The ONS stopped short of saying cases actually rose - because each weekaposs statistics cannot be directly compared. There are also very high levels of uncertainty, because the ONS is uses a model to estimateallcoronavirus cases in England - not just people who test positive.We explain the separate data on people testing positive below.  The number of people testing positive for Covid- in England has been slowly creeping up for weeks. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in England had fallen to  on July , the lowest since March. But since then the number has gradually ticked up and hit  on July  - a rise of %. The data, issued by Public Health England, could of course be due to more people getting tested for coronavirus - therefore more people testing positive. But whatever the cause, it shows confirmed cases are certainly not levelling off below , and could indicate rises or outbreaks in parts of the nation. The Daily Mail reports there has been an even higher % rise in new cases over a similar period. We used Public Health Englandaposs recommended method to calculate the number of new cases per day - looking at the dates tests were taken, not the date the results came back. But both methods - ours and the Mailaposs - show a steady rise in confirmed cases. For comparison, the rolling average of confirmed cases hit a peak of , on April . . Cases have surged in Oldham - and itaposs only one area where there are problems  Oldham, Greater Manchester, was the latest council yesterday to announce local restrictions after a coronavirus outbreak. It followed Leicester, Luton and Blackburn, all of which have barred residents from exiting lockdown at the same speed as the rest of England. The figures in Oldham show just how quickly the virus can spread. The council saw  cases in the week to  July - up % from  the week before. In Blackburn, the number of new people testing positive per , residents rose from  to  to  over the most recent three weeks. Over the same three-week period in Luton, the number of new positive tests per , residents rose from  to . Spain has been an example to the rest of Europe of how quickly a second wave could descend from where in Europe. The number of Covid- cases in Spain being reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control almost doubled last week. The public health body registered , cases in the week to July  and , in the week to July . While the figures canapost be directly compared to the UKaposs - for example, they record zero Spanish cases on weekends - they were worrying enough for the UK to clamp down with new rules on quarantine. Boris Johnson said: Letaposs be absolutely clear about whataposs happening in Europe, amongst some of our European friends.Iaposm afraid you are starting to see in some places the signs of a second wave of the pandemic. Spainaposs PM Pedro Sanchez has insisted the outbreaks are confined to particular regions, claiming most of Spain has case numbers lower than in the UK. .

The Labour leader urged ministers to consider testing people at airports when theyto the UK and then testing them again a few days later.British tourists in Spain faced chaos when the Government abruptly decided to scrap quarantine-free travel with the country at the weekend - forcing people to isolate for  days on ing home. Cabinet Minister Oliver Dowden said there was no viable alternative to the two-week quarantine period for ing tourists, and insisted testing people at airports was not a silver bullet. However Mr Starmer pointed to evidence suggesting the -day isolation period could be reduced with multiple tests. Speaking on a visit to Falmouth, the Labour leader said: Thereaposs some evidence it could be shortened to  or nine days but that depends on really effective testing and that is why we have pushed the Government so hard on testing. Thereaposs the capacity to test, the Government needs to use that to test on arrival and then after a short interval becausethat period of  days can be brought down to eight, nine or  then obviously thereaposs a huge benefit in that. Mr Starmer said Labour supported the need for quarantine measures but he added: Itaposs really unfortunate for those in other countries and I really feel for them but it is necessary that we take all preventative measures to prevent a second spike.  Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye pleaded with the Government to allow tests to ease restrictions - and said the airport would be ready to go in two weeks. He said: Weaposve started to mobilise on that so we can be ready as fast as possible. The speed really depends on the Government and them putting the legislation in place to allow people to come out of quarantine earlythey have passed two tests, and deciding whether the second test has to be after five days or eight days or some other time. Heathrow is working on a system where passengers would be charged £ a head for a test.Ministers are worried that testing people at airports will not work, as coronavirus can incubate for a period of time before it is detectable."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioners set out catalogue blame","story":"NewsPensioners set out catalogue of blame and shame against the BBC over free licencesCampaigners plan to force ministers to rethink ending free licences for millions of over-s by gumming up the systemShareCommentsByOliver Milne:,  JUL NewsPensioners have vowed to paralyse the TV licencing system ahead of the end of free licences for the over-s \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Silver Voices campaign group has pledged to force ministers into a rethink by “gumming up” the work of the TV licensing system. It claims that the BBC “has been lazy and cynical in agreeing exemptions only where pension credit is claimed” as only % of those eligible for the benefit currently claim it and those who just miss out on the top-up cash will be left struggling to pay for their licence. From August  the free licences for over-s will only apply to those who receive Pension Credit. The Mirror has called on the Government to keep its manesto promise and agree to fund the free licence fee.  It comes as pensioner led protests against the changes were due in half a dozen towns and cities across the UK. Socially distanced protests are planned in London, Newcastle, Oxford, Norwich, Liverpool, Irvine and Belfast. The disruption plan calls for over-s to stop Direct Debit payments to pay the licence fee, and tell the BBC that in future they will only correspond with TV Licensing by post, and only pay by cheque. It is aimed at making the cost of administering and enforcing the licence fee “much more expensive than keeping the free licence for a relatively small group”. From Saturday an estimated . million over-s who currently receive free licences will have to pay £. a year to watch their favourite shows. The Conservatives pledged at the  election to protect free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run until .No has blamed the corporation for introducing the charge - and called on them to reverse course. The BBC has said that keeping licences free for all over-s would cost £million by -. Dennis Reed, Director of Silver Voices said: “The BBC has had years to budget so that it could continue to provide free licences for the over s but now it is pleading poverty. “The only real poverty from this decision is for millions of older people who will struggle to pay the licence fee of £-, which is approximately equivalent to one week’s state pension. “Scrapping the free licence during a pandemic which has hammered the physical and mental health of the over s is beyond belief. “From Saturday our direct action against TV Licensing will reflect the fury of older people about this decision”. Jan Shortt, General Secretary of the NPC said: “The free TV licence for all over ’s is a universal entitlement to supplement our poor state pension.

This follows fresh outbreaks in Spain and other countries, with signs suggesting the arrival of a second wave in continental Europe. Meanwhile Brits ing from Spain were suddenly and without warning told to quarantine for  days, in an announcement at the weekend.And Professor Kirby says we could be right to be worried, as he held a conference for doctors and top experts to discuss what has been learnt about Covid- since it took hold in Europe. And he warned that younger people could be more at risk as the virus changes in the second wave. While Covid- affected mainly older people, ethnic minorities and those with underlying health conditions, younger people could be more at risk, in an echo of a previous pandemic.The  Spanish Flu pandemic claimed the lives of  million people across the world.It broke out in March  and mainly affected the elderly and infirm during the First World War. By August , it was hoped the pandemic was coming to an end, but the death spiked again in September to November. But the virus had developed into a new strain, and this hit young, healthy people. Speaking on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, Prof Kirby said: The winter is coming and almost certainly a second wave of this virus is coming.  What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people. Pandemic experts fear Covid- could go through a similar aposW curveapos as the Spanish Flu - the deadliest pandemic in history. The Spanish Flu first saw a aposU curveapos - two major spikes in deaths among the very old and very young. But this became a aposW curveapos - as death rates spiked among healthy  to -year-olds.Doctors in America are also said to fear death trends will be similar to those documented in the Spanish Flu, NY reports.Dr. Raul Vasquez, CEO of the Greater Buffalo United Accountable Healthcare Network, told the news site that the Spanish Flu came in three waves, with the aposU curveapos representing the first two waves. But in the final wave, the curve on the graph became a W shape as a third demographic of those aged  to -years-old saw disproportionate deaths, and not just the old or very young. In the Spanish Flu pandemic, it was all over by the summer of . The brutal reality then was that everyone who had caught the virus had either been killed, or had developed immunity to it. Retired Surgeon Prof Kirby also said obesity was a massive problem and overweight people are at higher risk of the second wave. He said: We do have a massive problem with weight in this country and we do need to address it. A message that came from this conference to patients all over the world isyou want to protect yourself against the second wave that is coming down the track then getting fit and losing weight is absolutely crucial.

Meghan is suing Associated Newspapers Limitedafter it published parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her father Thomas in August . The case continued today as her legal team bid to keep the identities of friends, who gave an interview to People magazine in February last year, secret in reports of the proceedings. In the People article, the friends spoke out against the bullying Meghan said she has faced, and have only been identied in confidential court documents. The duchess, , says her friends gave the interview without her knowledge, and denies a claim made by ANL that she caused or permitted the People article to be published.  In court documents for the hearing, before Mr Justice Warby, Meghanaposs lawyers argued that the friends - referred to as A to E - have a right to anonymity both as confidential journalistic sources and under their own privacy rights. Justin Rushbrooke QC, representing the duchess, said in written submissions to the court: To force the claimant, as the defendant urges this court to do, to disclose their identities to the public at this stage would be to exact an unacceptably high price for pursuing her claim for invasion of privacy against the defendant in respect of its disclosure of the letter.

Given the close factual nexus between the letter and the events leading up to the defendantaposs decision to publish its contents, it would be a cruel irony were she required to pay that price before her claim has even been determined.  Mr Rushbrooke added: The friends are not parties to this action, but unwilling participants. At this early stage of the litigation it cannot be said with certainty that they would be witnesses at the trial. He told the court that ANLaposs case is that Meghan had compromised her friendsapos right to privacy by putting their names into a public court document. He said: We say, on any analysis, that is actually a grotesque perversion of whataposs actually happened. Mr Rushbrooke added: It is bad enough that the position was taken in correspondence, but it is disappointing to see it persisted with in written submissionsput before the court. The true position is, let there be no doubt about it, that the claimant has done nothing of the sort. It was the defendant who made the interviews with People relevant.  It was the defendant who forced the claimant to identy the names of the five friends in a court document by serving a request for further information that required those names to be given and, for her part, we submit that the claimant has done what she reasonably and sensibly could to protect their confidentiality and privacy rights. Meghanaposs lawyers also argue that Associated Newspapers has already demonstrated a willingness to publish articles based on the contents of court documents. Mr Rushbrooke added: There can be little doubt that, in addition to defending this case through the courts, the defendant is seeking to maximise the publicity surrounding this case, which it has repeatedly dubbed aposthe trial of the centuryapos. ANLaposs lawyers are resisting the application to keep the identities of Meghanaposs friends secret, claiming the duchessaposs friends brought the letter into the public domain when it was referred to for the first time in the People interview. In written submissions, Anthony White QC, acting for ANL, said: The friends are important potential witnesses on a key issue. Reporting these matters without referring to names would be a heavy curtailment of the mediaaposs and the defendantaposs entitlement to report this case and the publicaposs right to know about it.  No friendaposs oral evidence could be fully and properly reported because full reporting might identy her, especially as there has already been media speculation as to their identities. Mr White also said the present order sought by the duchessaposs lawyers would leave Meghan entitled to disclose the identities to anyone - including the media - who could publish it, while ANLaposs titles would remain barred from doing so. In a witness statement submitted as part of the application, Meghan said: Associated Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, is threatening to publish the names of five women - five private citizens - who made a choice on their own to speak anonymously with a US media outlet more than a year ago, to defend me from the bullying behaviour of Britainaposs tabloid media. These five women are not on trial, and nor am I. The publisher of the Mail on Sunday is the one on trial.  It is this publisher that acted unlawfully and is attempting to evade accountability, to create a circus and distract from the point of this case - that the Mail on Sunday unlawfully published my private letter. Each of these women is a private citizen, young mother, and each has a basic right to privacy. Meghan is suing ANL over five articles, two in the Mail on Sunday and three on MailOnline, which were published in February  and reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her father in August . The headline on the article read: Revealed: The letter showing true tragedy of Meghanaposs rt with a father she says has aposbroken her heart into a million piecesapos. The duchess - who announced the launch of the legal action in October last year - is seeking damages from ANL, the newspaperaposs publisher and operator of the website, for alleged misuse of private information,infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act. ANL wholly denies the allegations, particularly the duchessaposs claim that the letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning, and says it will hotly contest the case.

Phoebe fell while visiting the Ceunant Mawr Waterfall in Llanberis on the edge of popular tourist destination Snowdonia. The six-year-old was pulled over the edge of the waterfall and down into the pool below, where thankfully a stranger managed to save her.She was left with just minor bruising and a scrape, the BBC reported.Phoebeaposs motheraposs partner Liam Bolland jumped into the water to try to save her before she was sucked away by the current. He was taking photos from the waterfallaposs viewing area when he heard a aposhorrible, horrible screamapos from his partner.  Liam spun round to see a look of terror on his partneraposs face, who then told him Phoebe was in the water.  Despite not being able to see her beneath the bubbling water he launched himself into the pool, only to be hit by its breathtaking coldness. Liam explained how he struggled to reach her while keeping himself above the water, before hearing Phoebe tumble over the edge. I could hear the screaming from my partner and son and the water bashing down next to me, he told The BBC.  Liam managed to pull himself up out of the water using some roots. While he did, other family members began shouting down to people by the lower pool where the water lands. One man managed to throw himself into the water and pull the young girl out.  While she was in a state of shock she was mercully unharmed. She is an amazing little girl, Liam said. She has a couple of small bruises and a bit of a scrape on her arm. Phoebe was taken by ambulance to Bangoraposs Ysbyty Gwynedd to be checked over. Liam thanked and hugged the man who saved her. In the days since the accident the family have revisited the waterfall to try and work out what happened.  It is unclear how Phoebe, who was standing a couple of feet from her mum, tumbled into the water. Liam has called for the area to be assessed for safety. Gwynedd council said warning signs were already in place. A member of Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team was near the waterfall when the incident unfolded. A spokesman for the group said: The Good Samaritan who entered the bottom pool was a very strong swimmer and used to cold water, they did however, experience the effects of cold water shock with a noticeable reduction in muscle power. While beautul, Llanberis waterfall has been the scene of several fatalities and very near misses.

The -year-old motorcyclist was killed in a road crash in August last year, and has since been the subject of an international row. His mother Charlotte Charles and father Tim Dunn said they had decided to scatter his ashes in Weymouth, Dorset, where the Dunns took their annual family holidays. The teen was last in his favourite town in July  and Mrs Charles described today as the hardest day weaposve ever had to face in our lives. Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn, alongside their partners Bruce and Tracey and other extended family members, travelled down to say goodbye to Harry.Mrs Charles said that although it will feel like they are setting him free, the fighting will continue to get US suspect Anne Sacoolas back to the UK. Askedher sonaposs funeral provided any closure, Mrs Charles said: No, and we were really numb back then - very much a bunch of zombies, to put it mildly. We donapost remember a lot about the first few weeks at all. Obviously weaposve been through so much since then - weaposve been to hell and back on many, many occasions. Weaposre not numb any more, we just hurt all day every day. The hurt is there constantly and it never, ever goes away. But now,  months on, today is going to be the hardest day weaposve ever had to face in our lives, and I canapost imagine it getting any harder. You shouldnapost have to scatter your own childaposs ashes. Mr Dunn said he hoped the family could have peace after scattering the ashes. Asked why they picked Weymouth, he said: From a very early age, Tracey and I first came with Harry and Niall to Weymouth on our first family holiday back in , and every year we would come back on the same week. It became a tradition, and as we know poor Harry died last year and today is exactly the last day he was here - he came for a night with his friends... so itaposs a year to the day since he was last in Weymouth and weaposre here to scatter his ashes and let him ride free.Mrs Charles added: We can rest assured that heaposs definitely out there riding the skies and going everywhere that he wants to go. Weaposve found a beautul spot where we are going to take him and weaposre sure that the wind will carry his ashes and the waves will be splashing up on the rocks to help him travel too. So weaposll feel like weaposve set him free. Commenting on what is next for the family, Mrs Charles said: Proper closure. Which is to make sure that Anne Sacoolas goes through the UK justice system. That has to happen. You and I would have had to have done it - in my view she is no dferent. So we will keep fighting - today is going to be extremely tough, but the determination never wavers, ever. It doesnapost matter what today takes out of us, tomorrow will be yet another day of fighting. Today is just for us but the fighting will continue.

Michael Seed, , known as Basil the Ghost, was living on an average of less than £, a year before the  heist, a court has heard. The frugal alarm specialist was arrested in , two years after the rest of the gang were jailed, and got  years for his part in the , £.million burglary. Prosecutor Philip Evans QC told the confiscation hearing that the court has to decideSeed had a criminal lestyle, what the benefit was and whether he gained from it. Mr Evans told Woolwich Crown Court: There is simply no supporting evidence of the defendantaposs assertion that he was running a jewellery business. Richard Sutton QC, defending, said his client had been living on around the same amount as the state pension. He said: “It does not suggest that this is a man living on the proceeds of crime. This is small beer indeed.” Seed was one of two raiders who climbed into the vault to loot  safe deposit boxes after the ageing criminals had bored through the thick concrete using a diamond-tipped drill. He is the son of a DNA pioneer who inherited his fatheraposs brilliant mind, but used his talents to further a career in crime. Seed evaded capture for three years before police raided his flat in Islington, north London - around two miles from Hatton Garden - in March . He denied any involvement in the heist, but was found guilty of conspiring to burgle, handle stolen goods and convert or transfer criminal property.  Judge Christopher Kinch QC, during the March  sentencing, told Seed: Your role was a central one. You were at the heart of the core activities that had to be carried out. You were not just there to fetch and carry. In my judgment this must rank among the worst offences of its type. Seedaposs fellow Hatton Garden ringleaders Brian Reader, , John Kenny Collins, , Daniel Jones, , and Terry Perkins, who died in prison last year aged , were all jailed in .

Police Scotland and Scottish SPCA have launched an investigation into the incident filmed by a fellow driver near Lochgelly in Fe, Scotland. The short clip shows the lurcher-type dog running just inches from the car’s spinning wheels before getting a fright and attempting to run away.The sickening act has sparked fury amongst animal lovers including local dog walking company GeoPaw, reports the Daily Record. A spokesperson said: “I almost cannot believe what I’m seeing. “This may look funny to some folk but going by comments from those who have seen the video the dog was absolutely terried. “It’s also extremely dangerous and just the height of stupidity. It’s unbelievable that any human can treat animals like this in this day and age. It’s just sickening.”  A spokesperson for the Scottish SPCA said the matter had not been reported to it, but that Police Scotland would act as the lead agency for any investigation. Officers have confirmed that an investigation is underway after the incident was reported to them.They added that an officer was sent to the scene - known locally as the stock car road - but the offending driver and vehicle could not be traced. Some dog owners suggested police should be treating the incident with greater urgency since the vehicle’s number plate was clearly visible. Dog owner Jenner Sterritt said: “I’ve seen time and time again, people complaining about all types of animal abuse, but they are letting the animals down big time.” The incident comes amid concerns about the treatment of greyhounds or other dogs used for racing across parts of Europe.

The immortal bird has stunned diners at the KFC in Blackpool, Lancashire, where it has been feasting on scraps of chips and chicken since the end of May. It seems unfazed by the cm arrow pierced through the middle of it. Despite it attracting the attention of worried customers who want to take it to the vet, the plucky gull, which is still able to fly, has so far evaded capture. Residents of the seaside resort are now living in fear the thug who shot the poor gull may strike again and calling on visitors to be vigilant. Blackpool-based property developer, Mark Leech, , first captured the bird on camera at the end of May during a trip to KFC with his family. The dad-of-two said: “I was very alarmed when I first saw the seagull. “The injury looked le-threatening to such a small animal. “I tried to lure it over with a chip to catch it and take it to the vets, but it wouldn’t take the bait.  “If there was a big cage with some food in there, I think it could be caught. “What’s disturbing is there’s someone out there willing to shoot innocent animals. “It makes you think – who will be next ” The seagull is thought to have been shot straight on with the cm arrow, the feather end of which is sticking out near the bird’s head. Mark said that several people had contacted the RSPCA about the injured seagull but so far no one had come to rescue it."},{"url":null,"title":"lottery draws jackpot prize win","story":"AdvertorialLast chance to enter Thursdays incredible £million le-changing jackpot drawThe deadline for the new Health Millions Super Jackpot draw is : this Thursday - dont miss out!ShareByDave Masters:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Advertorial\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Christian Brueckner lived off-grid at the vegetable garden near Hanover, Germany in , locals have claimed. The convicted sex offender reportedly had no interest in growing vegetables but lounged around drinking beer and told people he was a car mechanic while living in a van. The gazebo has since been destroyed but German media reports today that police digging up the site have found the cellar and are searching it for evidence about Madeleineaposs disappearance. Wolfgang Kossak, who lives in a neighbouring property, said the search was “ominous”.  He said many of the plots were sub-let and he recalled a stranger who “caused a lot of trouble” visiting the site around  and . According to local newspaper HAZ, detectives discovered and searched the cellar of a gazebo which had once stood at the garden. Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Kossak said: Christian Brueckner had the garden next to mine. He arrived in  and left within a year. He told me that he living off the grid, that he had not registered with the authorities – no one knew he was there. The building was not really a house, you might call it a shed. But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations.He said the buildings on Brueckneraposs plot of land were demolished in . He added that Brueckner would talk of his preference for southern Europe due to the climate and that the rapist had a VW Transporter van and parked it next to the allotment and lived in the vehicle. Police have said a camper van that was spotted in the Praia da Luz area in early  is vital to their investigation. Mobile phone records proved Brueckner was in Praia da Luz on the night she disappeared.  German detectives have not saidthey are looking for Madeleineaposs remains or simply evidence against Brueckner. German prosecutors have said they believe the missing youngster, who vanished from her Portuguese hotel room in , is dead. Police in Portugal have also renewed search efforts based on reports that the German suspect stayed in the area in a beat-up RV at the time Madeleine went missing. They have unsuccessfully searched around  wells for human remains. Mr Kossak said that Brueckner disappeared in  and he never saw him again.

They claim that Meghan was upset by the call, saying that she said very little while on the phone, instead choosing instead to simply listen to the counsel. They write: But after hanging up, she felt frustrated and emotional. While she knew the aide had good intentions, the surreal experience of having someone from her boyfriendaposs office tell her what kind of jewelry to wear or not to smile at a photographer was too much.  They said she felt distraught, and damnedshe did, and damnedshe didnapost. Meghan reportedly discussed the incident with a friend, saying: I canapost win. They make out like Iaposm to blame for these pictures, that it looks like Iaposm encouraging them, that me even acknowledging the cameras may not be sending the right message. I donapost know what to say. It was only yesterday that people online were saying I look miserable in pictures, because I was trying to just ignore the [photographer]. The necklace is the latest in a number of claims to emerge from the book, which will be released next month. It discusses a reported fallout between Harry and William, saying the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotheraposs snobbish attitude to his bride. Harry was offended by Williamaposs unwanted advice to take as much time as you need to get to know this girl, it is alleged. It also claims that things were tough between Kate and Meghan, saying the strain was evident at the King Power Royal Charity Polo Day last year. “While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word,” write the authors. Tensions peaked at their final joint engagement, the Commonwealth service at Westminster, in March. It’s claimed: “although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her”. The book also features details of the coupleaposs first date and the night news of their relationship was leaked. They write: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours.

Naomi Hubbard, , was forced to give birth to baby son George as husband Jack, also , rushed them to hospital in their Mazda CX on July . The couple had been sent home by Peterborough City Hospital, where Naomi works, just hours earlier after staff told them their fourth child wasn’t ready to be born. But Naomi’s waters broke almost as soon as they ed back home to Stamford, Lincs., and they rushed straight back out at am. Jack hit speeds of more than mph along a dual carriageway and ran through red lights as he made the  mile journey back to the hospital. As they were four minutes away from AE, Naomi called over to her husband from the front seat to tell him: “The baby’s head is coming out.” Naomi, who said she used tips picked up from watching One Born Every Minute, managed to deliver little George there and then as they sped along the A. She even calmly untangled the umbilical cord which got wrapped around his neck. The pair then continued on their journey to the hospital where medics took over and checked over healthy George, who was born weighing lbs oz. The couple believe Naomi’s love of the Channel  documentary series One Born Every Minute helped during the impromptu front seat delivery. Mum Naomi, an orthopaedic nurse, said: “I do like One Born Every Minute and watched it a lot. I’m quite a big fan “I felt him coming and grabbed his head and then his body like I had seen midwives grab them on the show. “It is quite embarrassing in a way because I’m a nurse, but I don’t deal with babies in my profession because I’m not a midwe. “But my training must have helped in some sort of way, because as a nurse it’s important to keep calm in highly stressful intense moments. “One Born Every Minute may have helped but you just act on instinct in moments like those because it all happened so fast. “I hadn’t had a natural birth before and wasn’t expecting there to be so little time between my waters breaking and the baby coming out. “We left home at about am and George was born at .am. “Once I’d untangled the umbilical cord and heard him cry that was an immense relief. “That is the first thing you listen for when you give birth to know the baby’s alright. “He’s settling in at home really well. His brother and sisters Poppy, Harry and Millie are besotted with him and want to cuddle him all the time. “It’s a good story to tell him when he grows up - the rest of my family didn’t quite believe it. They were shell shocked by it.” Jack, a tennis coach, said hospital staff didn’t believe him at first when he arrived at AE to tell them his we was in the car with their newborn baby. He added that he hadn’t received any penalty points yet for speeding or running through red lights - but was keeping George’s birth certicate ready just in case. He said: “I was rushing to get her to the hospital and as I was driving along she said ‘the baby’s head is coming out’. The next thing I knew, I heard a baby cry. “I was driving as fast as I could. I put my foot down to the floor. I didn’t dare look across at Naomi in the front seat. “I kept going as fast as I could and phoned the ambulance to say we are very close to the hospital and need some assistance when we get there. “It was probably a pretty lively speed, but it was a smooth, straight road and we weren’t bumping around. “When it happened we were going quite fast, at least mph. There can’t be too many babies who have been born at mph. “At one point I went through a red light and the driver started beeping me. I thought ‘you don’t know what’s happening in here mate’. “I haven’t received any penalty points yet, butI do I’ll send a letter showing George’s birth certicate so they know my we was having a baby in the car. Around  doctors and paramedics rushed out of AE to help when they arrived. “My we was in the front seat and the seatbelt had tangled with the umbilical cord, so one of the medical staff had to cut through the belt. I’ll have to get a new one,” said Jack. “It was our fourth child and the other four have been more strenuous in terms of birth. “In a way, it was probably the easiest out of the four. George didn’t fall on the floor of the car and there were no complications in the birth. “The medical staff were all shocked. “People were saying how calm I was, but she was so calm she casually untangled the seat belt and umbilical cord. “I just had to keep my foot down and go through a couple of red lights to get to the hospital as fast as I could.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new healthy london tube map","story":"NewsNew healthy London Tube map shows how long it takes to walk or cycle between stationsThe aim of the the Healthy London Transport Map is to get people exercising more and relying on public transport lessShareCommentsByAdrian Hearn:,  JUL NewsThe map shows you healthier ways to get about \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Online sports retailer Decathlon created a unique take on the iconic London Underground map, which looks at the benefits of walking, running, cycling and scootering, instead of using public transport. The Healthy London Transport Map tells you how long it will take to get one from station to the other compared to travelling on the tube.It also tells you how many calories you would burn, the amount of CO you will save and how much it would have cost to have taken the train. For example, taking the tube from Paddington to Oxford Circus would typically take around eight minutes and cost £.. But on a bike, it would take  minutes, burn  calories and save g of CO. Getting from Wimbledon to Westminster takes around  minutes on the tube but on a bike it would take approximately  minutes, burn  calories and save g of CO. The map was designed by Decathlon after a study revealed  per cent of workers are worried about ing to the workplace during the pandemic, with the idea of using public transport again a big concern. As a result,  per cent of Brits are going to avoid getting on a bus, train or taxi. The survey of , adults also found that  per cent did more exercise during lockdown than before. Walkingwas the most popular way to keep fit, while  per cent worked out while gardening,  per cent did floor exercises,  per cent went running and  per cent got out on their bicycle. Just over one in took part in online and on-demand fitness shows while  per cent did yoga and weight training to keep in shape.  More than halfof the adults, polled for Decathlon by OnePoll, are going to maintain their fitness regime when normality resumes. And  per cent want the government and local authorities to do more to encourage people to walk, run, scooter and cycle to work. Eric Mazillier, cycle-commuter and CEO of Decathlon UK, said: We created the Healthy Transport Map for London to encourage those living and commuting in and around the city to find healthier, safer and more sustainable ways to get around. Our goal for the creation of this free, easy-to-use tool, is to be used as a helping hand for people, their families and communities to achieve any ambitions to become happier, healthier - whether physically or financially - or to reduce the impact of their travel-habits on our environment. We hope this small but important development will be the little push that many people want and need, to find accessible and alternative ways to be where they need to be, without using those emission-heavy forms of transport.

Ebony Gooding, , her sister Tamara, , and cousin Rosie Trumpet, , have told how they were ganged up on by the youngsters while a five-year-old boy screamed racist abuse. The trio of childrenaposs entertainers had been booked to play at a garden party for a four-year-old.Ebony told the Sun that the children immediately began punching and kicking them.The women were dressed as the characters Marshall, Chase and Sky from the popular Channel  cartoon show, but Rosieaposs Chase costume was knocked off her by the childrenaposs blows. Ebony says five children took hold of her and pulled down on the head of her Sky costume. She was unable to see and was easily pushed around by the mob before one of the children took hold a microphone and racial slurs were repeatedly shouted, they claim.Ebony said: “We kept doing crying gestures to get them to calm down. No one was controlling them and they were just being allowed to attack us.” The women fled but parents closed the gates to stop them getting to their car, telling them they were not going to be getting out of the site. Demands were made by the parents of the boy whose birthday they had been booked to perform at. They wanted the £ deposit back - the trio intending to charge £ in total, money they have yet to receive - and the women were warned by another adult present that the dad was a complete lunatic so they should do as he asked.  The friends called the  emergency number and a massive police presence descended on the site near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Ebony said there were at least eight police officers, three riot vans and three police cars. The petried woman added: It was surreal and felt so over the top for a four-year-old’s birthday party but I can understand why they did not want to take any chances.

Lissie Harper had been married to PC Harper for just a month when he was killed by Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , as they tried to steal a quad bike. PC Harper, , was dragged for more than a mile along the country lanes of Berkshire when he became entangled in a tow rope attached to the teenagersapos getaway car. An Old Bailey jury acquitted all three defendants of murder on Friday, instead convicting Cole and Bowers of manslaughter. Long had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge.In an open letter posted on her Facebook page on Tuesday evening, Mrs Harper wrote to Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Lord Blunkett urging them and others to right such a despicable wrong for our country. She wrote: I implore you to hear my words, see the facts that are laid out before us, and I ask with no expectations other than hope that you might help me to make these changes be considered, to ensure that Andrew is given the retrial that he unquestionably deserves and to see that the justice system in our country is the solid ethical foundation that it rightly should be. Not the joke that so many of us now view it to be. The original trial was abandoned on the day the country went into lockdown in March, while for the retrial Mr Justice Edis ordered extra security measures amid fears of potential juror intimidation.  A female juror was discharged just a day before the remaining  started deliberating on their verdicts after she was seen by a prison officer to mouth Bye boys to the teenagers in the dock.

Full-time mum Laura Tucker, , had applied  nails, fastened the top on the glue pot and put it on a shelf before she went to take the bins out. Primark say the glue complies fully with EU standards for safety, quality and product labelling. But -month-old Santi Haines managed to reach the bottle from his highchair and removed the lid. He then got out of the highchair and onto the settee before pouring the contents over himself when his grandfather turned his back for a second. Laura and her dad Peter rushed Santi to the sink to wash the glue off, but were horried to find it had spilled on his arm and reacted with his pyjama top, causing a large burn. Santi was taken to hospital with third-degree burns so severe he had to have a graft operation - with surgeons removing skin from his bottom and transferring it to his left arm. Distraught Laura claims shocked nurses told her the ingredients in the nail glue were the same as the hospitalaposs surgical glue.

But while she was in the garden with the bins, her dad Peter popped into the kitchen for a matter of seconds and ed to find Santi on the sofa playing with the open bottle.  Laura noticed her toddler son was scratching his arm and removed his top to find burns just below his elbow. The little amount Santi had spilled onto the sofa was also starting to smoke. Nurses at Royal Berkshire Hospitalaposs AE department were astonished by Santiaposs injuries and couldnapost wash out all of the glue, even after two attempts. Santi was transferred to Stoke Mandeville Hospitalaposs specialist burns unit in Aylesbury, Bucks., where he underwent a skin graft operation. Laura was unable to be with her son when he was being put under anaesthetic or when he came round later due to social distancing measures. She said: We were worried because babies put everything in their mouths!  I have no problems with how we were treated in hospital, but it did make it lots harder. Fortunately, Santi was allowed tohome immediately after the procedure. Laura informed Primark but is yet to hear back from the company. She also posted about her experience on social media, and was appalled when she received numerous messages from people who had also been burned by the product. Laura discovered that some of the people who had also complained to the brand had only received a £ voucher in compensation. A Primark spokesperson said: We were very sorry to learn of this customeraposs experience and we are in touch with her to investigate her complaint.

Police say Jerry David Thompson took his roommate and landlordaposs head off before refusing to talk about the horric crime in Connecticut, US.

The victim, -year-old Victor King, was a professional bridge player and described as one of the good guys — one that would never hurt a soul. The former IT worker for Travelers insurance had recently taken Thompson in as a tenant for his spare bedroom. An arrest warrant states Thompson had threatened his landlord with the huge sword in a row about him not paying the rent. Mr King had reported this to the police a day before he was decapitated, on Sunday. He claimed Thompson waved the blade at him.

When Thompson was pulled over in his car in the city after a manhunt, he refused to speak.

Thompson, who has previous convictions for robbery and assault, has remained silent. Thompson, who has previous convictions for assault and robbery, was arraigned Tuesday in Superior Court,  and was held on  million bail.

It is not known how the man knows the two children. The video, which has been shared thousands of times on social media left  parents shocked at the harshness of the punishment. One person tweeted: This is gross and anyone condoning it is disgusting as well. If you have to hit your kids to make them listen, you’re the problem. Another condemned the behaviour. They tweeted: Yes, it’s wrong. Hitting solves nothing. It makes you fear the hell out of someone. That kind of fear isn’t parenting. Just because your parents did this to you, doesn’t make it right. There are better ways to communicate than putting hands on someone, especially a child.  That is far too much, another wrote. Kids are learning and growing still. Theyaposre not full adults who understand everything. This kind of hitting is abuse. Wrong, another commented. If you have to resort to hitting a child then you’ve lost control. It’s no longer a teachable moment. I’m okay with spanking but this was VERY hard and too many times.  But disturbingly many didnapost see an issue with the punishment. One person tweeted: Right.

For years, Japanaposs north coast had been the site of the disturbing phenomenon, with rickety fishing vessels arriving more than ,km from where they set out. In  the numbers were unprecedented with more than  damaged boats landing, containing a total of  bodies, compared to  vessels the year before. Some have speculated the weather that year was to blame and that North Koreaaposs aging fishing population had something to do with the problem. But a study by non-profit Global Fishing Watch and published today in journal Science Advances has been able to shed some light on the matter. Researchers used satellite technologies to analyse marine traffic in northeast Asia in  and , and discovered hundreds of dark fishing fleets - believed to be Chinese - have been operating in North Korean waters - apparently illegally. This meant ushering out North Korean boats and forcing them on ill-advised ventures into Russian and Japanese waters, poorly equipped for long distance travel.For foreigners, fishing in waters off the North Korean coast or trading fish caught there internationally is against the law - but it doesnapost appear to have deterred the huge swathes of rogue ships, according to the report. The paperaposs authors estimate in  and  alone these ships caught more than , metric tons of Pacic flying squid, a particularly valuable seafood - worth £ million. Jaeyoon Park, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch and co-lead author of the study, said: It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by vessels originating from one country operating in another nationaposs waters. Another author, Jungsam Lee, said the North Korean vesselsapos decision to try their luck in distant foreign waters would have proved catastrophic for many of the fisherman.  It is too dangerous for them to work in the same waters as the Chinese trawlers, he explained. Thataposs why theyaposre pushed to work in Russian and Japanese waters and that explains why some of North Koreaaposs damaged vessels showed up on the beaches of Japan. Northeast Asiaaposs waters are some of the most contested seas in the world, but fish stocks are in dramatic decline. The Pacic flying squid stocks have dropped  per cent in South Korean waters and  per cent Japanese waters since , according to Global Fishing Watch.

We expect that there will be strong legacy from our partnership approach with our private, voluntary and independentproviders that will continue to change the way we perceive ELC.”Zoe Williamson, manager of VIP Childcare in Elgin, said of the funding: “This funding has come at a welcome time for our nursery and others like us. While we already incorporated outdoor learning as standard this will enable us to invest in outdoor play equipment and expand our outdoor provision to allow more time outside.”Leann Cairns, a childminder in Lossiemouth, said: “We know the benefits to children of being outdoors, both in their health and learning, so this funding will enable me to develop more activities to enhance the time spent outside.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society. Now that it is realised how our inidual decision making makes a dference, whatever our age, we have no need to feel helpless.It is time to ask for the information and support we need."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSimon Macdonald from Kilmichael Glassary submitted this week#s featured image.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

company would run the drive-thru coffee shop however, an image of the proposed outlet shows a logo for Starbucks.He said it was hoped the work would be completed within a yearplanning consent was granted.A landscape design report, submitted with the planning application, said the ldquoenhanced car park arrangement would provide nine accessible parking bays close to the building entrances and five electric car charging points.It added: ldquoWith the proposed coffee shop there is an opportunity to provide two areas of external seating ndash these have been carefully sited to maximise a

drive-thru.ldquoTo the front of the retained Travelodge building, we have proposed another plant bed, planted with native trees ndash birch and rowan ndash and robust groundcover.ldquoElsewhere in the new car park, we have looked to punctuate the space with street trees these trees will help to provide vertical structure to the space.ldquoThe proposals look to retain the dense group of semi-mature trees to the west of the site.ldquoTo the north of the site there is a row of sycamore trees that will also be retained.ldquoWith the demolition of the building, there will be a gap in these trees and it is proposed that an additional four sycamore trees are planted to complete the row.ldquoThese trees will work as a buffer between the new car park and the road.ldquoTo make way for the development we are proposing to remove five small trees within the car park that have failed to establish.Other tree planting will take place around the site.Irene Tait, chair of Musselburgh  Inveresk Community

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!DURING lockdown, I was trying to make the most of my free time ndash going on daily walks, working on my website, editing photos from before lockdown, designing my first book and completing A LOT of jigsaws .After the lockdown restrictions started to ease, I was able to spend even more time outdoors than I would normally do. I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes. These dogs were just wonderful, not every day you see dogs as well behaved as these two!My first and, I hope, not last experience with the rosy starling was unforgettable!

Nobody knew what to expect.ldquoGala day itself was amazing, from the glorious weather to the great response we got from the locals as we travelled around in convoy tooting and waving, visiting many streets of the town which the normal gala parade doesnrsquot visit. The people of Prestonpans certainly came out to show their support and for that we are truly grateful.ldquoWe would like to take this opportunity to thank the future Queen Lily [Bennion] and her royal court, as well as their families for their patience and understanding.

initiative to provide additional space for physical distancing to protect public health, work has started on a temporary cycle route between Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton which will run parallel to the main B Edinburgh Road.The three-metre wide path will be created by laying hard surfacing down on the grass verge on the north side of the carriageway between the two communities.The path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these to be carefully collected prior to the start of the works and they have been relocated on the other side of the road."},{"url":null,"title":"column-job-figures-worrying","story":"Furloughing has

Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set. Theyre clear dots that extract impurities while also creating a protective layer over the pimple so nothing  can irritate itrsquo. Jessica also says that she makes sure to focus on her chin and lower face when washing her face since thats the area covered by a mask.The product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next.

Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Then came the threat of a global apocalypse, which Five managed to help his family escape, using his powers.Now, in series two, we see the impact of that Five warned it was risky, and indeed, thats how theyve ended up in dferent periods of time .Some of the siblings have been stuck in the past for years, and have built lives for themselves, while the last to land is Five - bang in the middle of a nuclear doomsday.Over the  new episodes, we will see the Umbrella Academy attempting to reunite with each other, stop a doomsday from happening, and get back to the present day, all while facing other dangers along the way.One word used to describe this show a lot is \"weird\", something Tom Hopper, who plays Luther, is happy to be part of.\"Weird stands out, doesnt it \" enthuses the Leicestershire-born star, , whos also appeared in TV shows Black Sails and Merlin.\"If its not been done  times before, then its something that people could relate to in a dferent way.\"\"Weird is just a new normal that hasnt arrived yet,\" points out kooky Sheehan.\"You could say that about anything really... electricity.

The timing is quite timely.\"Not only are Hopper and Sheehan co-stars, but the chatty, fun pair also seem like good friends and, while shooting season two, birthed the idea of making a podcast together, called The Earth Locker.\"It was great, it gave us a brilliant avenue to focus on in between shooting,\" recalls Hopper.\"There are so many hours in the day that can just be wasted, or you can make them productive.\"Me and Rob started this project that eventually has now become The Earth Locker which is, ultimately, to bring light to a lot of the problems that are on this earth that we dont recognise as problems, and actually are, and theyre all something we can do something about.\"There are experts in the world that are doing things about these problems, and thats who were interviewing in The Earth Locker podcast.\"The Umbrella Academy is available on Netflix."},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-empty-space-veg-patch-boost-soil-green-manure-crops","story":"If youve spare room on your allotment, or in your garden, for crops that will fill empty spaces and boost your soil, consider plants that can turn into green manure.You may have harvested potatoes and onions, but plant some fast-germinating replacements and youll stop weeds from growing, keep the goodness in, and help soil structure.What are green manures They are crops that can help improve your plots structure, stop nutrients from being washed out by rain, and provide good ground cover to stop weeds emerging. Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"food-chef-tom-kerridge-shares-passion-bbqs","story":"Barbecues at the ready because chef Tom Kerridge, holder of two Michelin stars, has a trove of summertime cooking treats to share.During the course of his new show, Tom Kerridge Barbecues - on the Food Network, the chef will be showing off some old and new recipes using charcoal, smoke and fire.He talks about his favourite dish from the series and why everyone - including professional chefs - are prone to barbecue disasters from time to time.How did this series come about \"I filmed with Food Network last year, a big series for the States, they gave me a call and said listen do you want to do something with barbecues... it was actually a really good, fun thing to do.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain.

In Edinburgh, the accused is behind a sheet of glass and the camera is on the other side so the sound quality isnrsquot great on the video link.

Agents have been in court and theyrsquove been able to hear other agents consulting with their clients where.ldquoWe are concerned that in some cases this is causing a breach of EHRC rights. Clients are entitled to consult with a solicitor and that consultation should be confidential. Being able to hear what is going on in court is also part of their right to a fair trial - they should be able to effectively participate and, in some cases, they havenrsquot been able to do that.The custody courts deal with people who have been arrested and are being held by Police Scotland.At present, most cases involve the accused being taken to court by security staff, but virtual hearings have been brought in to deal with people with suspected or confirmed Covid-.This has now been expanded to a handful of non-covid cases and the court service aims to roll it out so that virtual custody hearings become the ldquonorm in Scotland.However, lawyers believe there needs to be investment in infrastructure and technology before this can happen.Stuart Murray, president of Aberdeen Bar Association, said: ldquoWhat theyrsquove done in these cases is removed face to face contact with a solicitor and substituted it with a remote access conversation when the technology just isnrsquot up to scratch.ldquoThe video link we were supposed to use rarely worked, and on occasion it can take as many as  phone calls to get through to the police station in order to speak to a client before they appeared in court. And then on the occasions when the link did work, most clients couldnrsquot hear what was going on in court.

This included: pregnant women: being put on sick pay rather than being furloughed, which affected their statutory maternity benefit entitlement being made redundant before going on maternity leave and being pressurised into working in unsafe working environments. Similarly, as the lockdown has been lted, pregnant women have found that they are being encouraged toto unsafe workplaces and are still being treated unfairly.\"SNP Shadow Chancellor Alison Thewliss MP said the governments plans to end the furlough scheme in October were \"premature and reckless\",She said: \" In just under a weekrsquos time, the Tory government will plough ahead with its premature and reckless plans to cut back support through the Job Retention Scheme ndash despite warnings that this could lead to a jobs bloodbath.\"If the Chancellor is serious about protecting jobs and businesses, and ensuring a strong economic recovery, then he must strengthen and extend the furlough schemes into  ndash including closing the gaps that see seasonal workers, freelancers, self-employed people, and others getting little to no help during this unprecedented crisis.ldquoFailing to do so could lead to redundancies on a level not seen since the s and force many more businesses to pull down their shutters for good.\"Jamie Stone, Lib Dem MP, said it should not be on employers to support freelance workers, after the BBC announced that it would offer financial support to  freelancers they regularly employ.Mr Stone, who chairs the crossparty parliamentary group fighting for people excluded from government schemes, said: \"Freelancers are of immeasurable valuable to our arts and screen sectors.ldquoMillions of people across the UK have been left in bleak situations with no income and no support throughout the pandemic.

Irsquove on occasion actually refused to engage in questions that I judged would have taken us into political territory.Referring to Ms Forbesrsquos point about borrowing powers, she said: ldquoSometimes one personrsquos political issue is another personrsquos very legitimate issue part and parcel of dealing with Covid, and the fiscal flexibility of the government to deal with the overall consequences of Covid I would put into the latter category.ldquoI accept that others with a dferent view of that will see that as political.ldquoBut the idea that our ability to deal financially with the economic impact of Covid is not a part of the handling of this doesnrsquot bear much scrutiny.She went on: ldquoI think these briefings are important. We are not out of this pandemic yet. This pandemic, to use the language of the World Health Organisation, is still accelerating globally.ldquoWersquore in a very good position, relatively speaking, in Scotland right now, but we cannot take it for granted.ldquoMy biggest concern right now is that there things all of us can do to keep this under control that wersquore all maybe getting a bit lax at doing.ldquoIrsquom trying to strike a balance here - I donrsquot want to talk about politics here, Irsquove refused to do that on more occasions that I can remember right now - but Irsquom also trying to strike a balance between not doing that but doing the courtesy that I owe to journalists of answering the questions you pose to me.\"I might not get that right at every occasion.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing.

According to NHS Orkney#s interim chief executive, Michael Dickson, this is because the new positive test was conducted by an industrial lab which had not been validated by the NHS.The inidual, who is not currently in Orkney — but has been in the county during the past week — has been asked to self-isolated. This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board. He added that, like in Shetland, he would be working to see whether some industries which have been testing their staff for the virus could do so through an NHS veried lab.#What we do is presume the person is positive,# Mr Dickson continued.#We kick in all the our well-rehearsed contact-tracing mechanisms and we instruct the person to self-isolate where they are.#When this happened in Shetland, the second test came back negative. It#s dficult, but we have to err by the side of caution.#Mr Dickson said that he understood that there would be an element of anxiety around this new possible case, and advised that all those who have come into signicant contact with the inidual in question will be contacted and asked to self-isolate for  days. If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.#If you do not receive a call from our contact tracing team, then basically you#ve not been in signicant contact with this inidual,# the interim chief executive said.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The gradual easing of restrictions will hopefully ensure that our ious activities can continue to take place.“As District Chair, I have chosen Special Olympics as my Charity for this year and I look forward to engaging with all of our Clubs in supporting this particular group – as well, of course, as the myriad of local charities which our members support over the years. I look forward to working closely with our friends across the Rotary family. I am also indebted to the members of my local Club for all of their encouragement and support.” Patricia took up her new role on  July and will continue for  months.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

Two, David Hilditch and Trevor Clarke, denied it represented a challenge to Mrs Foster but said they would make no further comment on their reasons for abstaining.Thomas Buchanan said he had no comment to make while the remaining eight abstaining MLAs - Alex Easton, Paula Bradley, Joanne Bunting, Jonathan Buckley, Paul Frew, William Humphrey, and former ministers Mervyn Storey and Michelle McIlveen - have yet to respond.The controversial bill gives ministers more inidual powers, and was eventually passed by  votes to , with  abstentions.The rebellion from DUP MLAs followed warnings from former First Minister Peter Robinson#s adviser Richard Bullick, who said it would effectively remove the DUP#s ability to veto decisions it disagreed with. He claimed the DUP was sleepwalking into making profound constitutional amendments and shedding gains negotiated in the  St Andrews Agreement.He said he was concerned about the danger of the DUP rebellion being interpreted as a challenge to Mrs Foster#s authority, but it turns on a few moving parts. These issues are more grey than some current arguments suggest, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe DUP’s Thomas Buchanan FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe DUP’s Thomas BuchananRadio Ulster#s Nolan Show reported that senior DUP figures had urged Mrs Foster to pause the bill, including MPs Sammy Wilson and Jeffrey Donaldson as well as former MP Nigel Dodds.A DUP statement has since called the bill a very technical piece of legislation, which was the subject of considerable legal input from senior government lawyers.It added: Bills would not normally be accelerated but in recognition some members would have like more time to debate this bill we relaxed our whip on the matter.The new law was introduced following a court judgment two years ago, which overturned the Executive#s approval for a waste incinerator near Mallusk.Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said he regretted that the Assembly had passed poor and badly thought-out legislation.The fact that the Junior Ministers admitted that no changes in planning, which this Bill was supposedly about, can be enacted until the revised ministerial code is brought before the Assembly in either the autumn or early winter, shows that not only was there ample time to give this bill proper consideration, but also that the flaws highlighted in this process re-emphasise that no lessons have been learnt since RHI, he said.While we did not manage to defeat the bill, the fact that some DUP MLAs chose to abstain in person shows the considerable disquiet that there is across much of the Assembly in this process. I fear that the flaws in this bill could haunt us for many years to come.Sinn Fein junior minister Declan Kearney denied the legislation would allow ministers to go on #solo runs# and said it was necessary to progress key planning decisions.

However, Mr Weir has now indicated that having children ing to all , schools here full-time in the new academic year, with appropriate safeguarding and mitigation measures for staff and pupils, is quite achievable. Mr Weir confirmed on Wednesday that he will be discussing a new plan around the full resumption of schools across the board with his Executive colleagues in the coming days. Speaking to the Belfastat an event at Cregagh Primary School, Mr Weir added: We#re on a trajectory for theof schools.

Mr Allen says any new plans will require updated guidance as soon as possible. At present the school will essentially be split into two groups with some pupils in school for the first week of September and following their timetable for a week, while the others remain at home doing remote learning. That will be flipped for the second week and rotated on a week-in, week-out basis because we see no other way to do this while social distancing restrictions are in place. In my opinion, for all schools to be back as normal we need to see the total removal of social distancing restrictions. Currently for me to fit pupils into classrooms at a one-metre distance would allow roughly for half or two-thirds of pupils, teachers and classroom assistants. Neil Megaw is principal of Newtownhamilton High School in south Armagh, which has an enrolment of  pupils with  staff.He said: We have provisional plans in place for our restart on August  but are continuing to monitor the situation on a daily basis before we share final arrangements with our pupils, parents and staff in early August.As a father of two children, I fully understand the position that parents face in relation to child care, and it is trying to balance this issue with the provision of a safe environment that prevents the spread of Covid-.A €m package was announced in the Republic earlier this week to get children back to school at the end of August.It includes funding to hire new post-primary teaching staff - including  guidance posts,  extra teachers, and  posts for schools having the most dficulty reopening.Mr Weir is also facing growing pressure over funding to ensure a safeto classrooms here can be achieved. But he has said the Executive would have to decideit could make more money available for schools.He added: In terms of resourcing, I#ve already indicated there might be some additional costs that will be incurred in terms of restart.Mr Weir said his department would undoubtedly need to seek additional financial support to accommodate the fullof schools.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandMums# school masks plea over kids with hearing impairmentsTwo mothers of children with hearing dficulties have urged Education Minister Peter Weir not to impose the mandatory wearing of face coverings when pupilsto classrooms next month.Most ReadSacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Revealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportNora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsBelfast nightclub owner left with £ in bank account pleads for Stormont#s help,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They say masks will make it impossible for the children to lip read what their teachers and friends are saying. Lissa, whose four-year-old Penny is due to start at Ballyclare Primary School in September, says she is concerned about her daughter#s future development. Penny lost her hearing when she was a year-and-a-half but we didn#t know until her speech failed to develop, Lissa explained. With her speech delayed, she had her implants fitted last year so she had already lost quite a lot of development time, and then her nursery was closed for months due to the lockdown. It will be challenging enough for Penny entering school in terms of communication on top of all of this uncertainty around the virus. I#m concerned but I still want her to thrive as best she can and she needs an educational setting to do that. While Penny has the implants she still doesn#t hear everything, so she relies on facial expressions and lip reading to piece together what#s being said just like a jigsaw puzzle.

He relies completely on lip reading and sign language to communicate. Obviously he has missed out on speech therapy, which he would have got in school over the past few months but for the lockdown. My main concern is getting Emmett back into school because he has missed out on so much and home schooling has been very hard over recent months due to his speech and developmental issues.He was in hospital recently and the staff had to wear face coverings, but at times he couldn#t understand what they were saying, as they cause mumbling.

Throughout the crisis we have continued to draw down mortgages and are currently lending up to % loan to value.As a responsible lender we consider a range of factors to assess the affordability of the mortgage in the long-term. At this time we are not accepting mortgage applications from customers who are on furlough but we will keep this under review.Nationwide Building Society said it will consider applications from people who have been furloughed but added those on furlough are not eligible for the society#s recently launched % loan to value first-time buyer mortgages.Bank of Ireland said: We are lending to customers who are furloughed. We#ll ask customers to provide some information about the terms of the furlough during the application process.Lender AIB said: All our lending is based on the customer#s ability to repay.

Applications are dealt with on a case by case basis.Ulster Bank said it was “strongly committed to lending to all kinds of mortgage borrowers - this includes those on furlough and those ing from furlough”.“As always, they base lending decisions on affordability and ability to repay and they take each case on an inidual basis.”A spokeswoman for Progressive Building Society said it is “a responsible lender and reviews and assesses every case on an inidual basis including the income and expenditure of all applicants”.HSBC said it will not lend to furloughed workers whoseto work date is further than three months away or there is nodate at all.Mortgage broker and advisor London  Country said: “Mortgage lenders have sought to support those on furlough through the lockdown period and in the main have continued to accept furloughed income when considering how much they can offer to borrowers. “That would of course often mean a reduced income and consequent reduction in the size of borrowing available but at least most lenders would be able to consider lending.  “As we move closer to the unwinding of the jobs retention scheme borrowers should expect to see more questions aboutto work and some lenders are now stipulating that they will want some confirmation. “Getting employer confirmation may not be possible for all at this stage but on the upside those that can, may be able to use theirto work income for the affordability assessment.  “That approach will be consistent whether for first time buyers or next time buyers as lenders will need to be able to demonstrate that the mortgage is affordable and will remain sustainable. “However the market is still light on deals for those with small deposits which is often a bigger issue for first time buyers and some of the lenders that have ed to the % LTV market will potentially set a higher expectation when it comes to credit score.”Belfast Most ReadSacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Revealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportNora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsBelfast nightclub owner left with £ in bank account pleads for Stormont#s help,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The teenager#s body was discovered on August  beside a small stream about .km from the resort.Although her family believe there was a criminal element to what happened, police have said there was no sign the -year-old was abducted or raped.A preliminary post-mortem examination showed she succumbed to intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.An inquest into her death is due to begin on August  and last until September .Denis Barror, the Dublin-based solicitor acting for Meabh and her French father Sebastien, declined to comment on the proceedings.Ms Brennan denied defaming the couple and said she was surprised that they were taking a case. I will be defending myself. I don#t believe they have a cause of action against me, she said.Ms Brennan said that while she wrote very extreme things on the social media , she believed them to be true. Facebook declined to comment.Ms Brennan is a former partner in a Dublin law firm, and specialised in employment and equality law. She retired in  due to an illness.She confirmed her Facebook account was suspended for  days last September but was reinstated and remains active.The case is the second set of proceedings initiated by the Quoirin family since the tragedy occurred. They are also suing the owner of the resort for alleged negligence.Confirming details of that case last January, Sankara Nair, a lawyer for Nora#s parents, said the family strongly believed she was abducted as she had mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.The lawsuit alleges a cottage window was found ajar, with its latch broken, on the morning she disappeared.It is also claimed the resort gate was left open without any security and there was no surveillance camera except for the reception area.According to the claim, Nora had poor motor skills and needed help to walk. Although in her mid-teens, her mental age was about five or six years.Mr Sankara said the resort was not safe for Nora and that anybody could have come in and taken her. In an interview with RTE News last December, Meabh and Sebastian Quoirin said they were determined to get truth and justice.I think we will seek justice in so far as we can. We have to find peace in our own hearts, said Meabh Quoirin.We will carry Nora with us forever. She#s with us here every day. I talk to her every day. She holds my hand. We hear her. We see her in all that we do at home.

We need a single island system of protection as that is the only way we can get ahead of this virus.”Mr Martin said the Republic of Ireland has stricter travel restrictions in place, with people advised to only visit an approved list of  countries, while Northern Ireland allows .He said while the issue of travel restrictions will be discussed, there are challenges when it comes to adopting an all island approach.“We do have to have a reality check in terms of what is possible and what is not possible and we need to be honest with people,” he said.“I think I have to make the point because we have had a much stricter guidance in the Republic with regard to travel – stricter in terms of what is going on in the North at the moment.“I think it important to recognise the dangers travel can present in terms of creating spikes on the island of Ireland. We have to work towards a joint approach in relation to that.”Elsewhere, People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, whose party has representatives on both sides of the border, said a united Ireland will not be possible due to the dferent health services.“Why would anyone from the North want to be part of a united Ireland when we have a dysal, two-tier health service,” he said.“They won’t do it. We need a national public health service.”Mr Boyd Barrett also called on the Taoiseach “to separate Church and State”.He added: “Why on earth would people in the North join the State when % of our schools are controlled by the Catholic Church ”Mr Martin said the Government has set up a “Shared Island” unit which will work towards a consensus on a shared island, but has ruled out a poll on a united Ireland.He said he took Mr Boyd Barrett’s point in relation to the health service and added that one of the elements of the Shared Island unit will be to see how the two jurisdictions can use each other’s health services.Mr Martin said Brexit will also feature highly on the meeting’s agenda.He said: “We’re having the meeting for the first time in three-and-a-half years and I hope it will help us to create a structure that will help us deal with the undoubted dficulties that Brexit has brought about.“We do need to navigate and manage the island in a post-Brexit situation.”PAMost ReadSacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Revealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportNora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsBelfast nightclub owner left with £ in bank account pleads for Stormont#s help,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He opened his conference speech saying it was always good to start the day with a healthy breakfast while holding a carton of yoghurt.In the aftermath of his comments the then Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams caused offence when talking about the Trojan horse in the republican strategy for outreach to people on the basis of equality and how that was the way to break these bastards.The point is to actually break these bastards - that#s the point. And what#s going to break them is equality.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge.

The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor McGintys latest single Home To The Heartland recently topped the iTunes World Music Chart and has won praise from some of the citys most famous sons and daughters. After being sent a preview of the song footballer James McClean described it as brilliant, while Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson said it was a soulful and heartfelt tribute to Derry.This is without doubt the proudest I have been about any song I have ever released or recorded and to make it even more special I wrote the song myself, said Conor.I penned this song as a modern day Derry anthem along with the exquisite musical skills of Eamonn Karran.It has a Celtic pop twist to it and people seem to really like it.“Home To The Heartland” is written from the perspective of a Derry emigrant ing home and mentions many local landmarks such as Shipquay Street and Ebrington.Conor had been due to marry his fiancee Aisling this year, but the wedding has now been cancelled twice due to lockdown.Writing this song is probably the only good thing to come out of lockdown for me, said Conor.Ashaving to cancel your wedding once wasn’t hard enough to take, having to do it for a second time two months later was even worse.I think this year will be remembered by so many as an absolute kick in the teeth for so many dferent reasons.Conor says entertainers are struggling to find work due to the current government restrictions. googletag.cmd.push Something needs to be done to prevent the arts and entertainment sector falling through itself in the next few months, he said.It provides work to so much more than just the singer or musician. We all have bills, we all need to find ways to make an income and there is only so much adaptation you can do. We are applying for jobs but when you have been a self employed musician for years it is hard to get your foot in the door anywhere that isn’t in the entertainment sector.Id like Stormount to please try and think outside the box - It has become desperate times for many. googletag.cmd.push We will look forward to our wedding next year in September but in the meantime it would be great to be able to go back to work and provide.Put a screen up in front of me while I sing for all I care!‘Home to the Heartland’ is currently available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March .

We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced.

Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in. You dont hear people talking about squeezing the Munster championship into the fixtures, do you ”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation. Take a trip with confidence Northern Ireland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. googletag.cmd.push The national tourist organisations of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation. Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.  LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner. “There are a lot of positive health implications of being outside and on the water.”  LOCH LOMOND: Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened self-catering properties and cruises For more information on staying safe, please go to www.discovernorthernireland. _CoronavirusPHutm_mediumdisplayutm_sourceMediaForceutm_contentxframingdclidCOvM_IeoCFQzwQodkcEARw\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener\" --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history. We will not let this happen..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"MoT centres open  ","story":"DRIVERS across the district are heading back to Downpatrickrsquos MoT centre this month.The Driver and Vehicle Agencyhas begun a phasedof MoT tests, with driving tests also set to resume.MoT tests for what are being described as ldquopriority vehicle groups began on Monday and testing for other vehicles is due to recommence in August.There are also plans to reinstate some driver testing services in July, but these will only be allowed to proceedthey can be done safely and social distancing requirements can be met.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon said ldquoofficials have been working hard to find solutions to help customers.Ms Mallon said the DVA has carried out ldquoa full review of risk assessments and developed new MoT processes that comply with all the published government public health advice and guidance.The minister continued: ldquoA number of measures have been put in place including a range of exemptions and extensions so that, as far as possible, vehicles can be kept on the road safely and most people can keep driving.ldquoCovid- has caused unprecedented dficulties for all of us and I thank our customers for their patience at this very challenging time.Ms Mallon also confirmed that new lts have been installed at  of the provincersquos test centres.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.

I fully understand, and support the need for language ersity.”Complaints have been made about the post to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards by Conradh na Gaeilge, an advocacy group for Irish language speakers, and a -year-old boy.Conradh na Gaeilge alleged the post is a breach of the House of Commons code of conduct, saying it was “offensive and insulting in nature to those who speak the Irish language”.In a complaint letter shared on Twitter, Adam Mac Giolla Easbuic, who attends an Irish Medium School in Dungiven – within Mr Campbell’s constituency – requested the commissioner investigates “racist undertones to both Germans and Irish speakers”.He wrote: “I find Mr Campbell’s comments extremely offensive and disrespectful.“It is clear that he learned nothing during the Acht na Gaeilge campaign for an Irish Language Act that me and all my friends took part in.“I don’t think his comments are suitable for an MP to make.“Thank you for taking the time to read my complaint. I hope that you will investigate this.”Disagreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein over an Irish Language Act for Northern Ireland was a sticking point in political talks between the parties last year, ahead of the New Decade New Approach deal.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It also means our business isnrsquot efficient.The Vale council says the measures were implemented based on government guidance and discussion with representatives of tradersrsquo groups in Penarth, as well as the town council.Shoppers have said they have been going where due to the restrictions, and it is deterring them for shopping locally, while others have said it could be a good thing for the town.Cllr Lis Burnett, Vale of Glamorgan Council Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, said: ldquoThe safety of shoppers visiting town centres in the Vale is our number one priority and so measures designed to promote social distancing and protect people have been introduced in these locations.ldquoThis has involved removing some parking bays in order to create more safe space for pedestrians at pinch points in the towns.ldquoThe new more stream-lined fixed bollards are less overpowering in the street scene and after the most recent review the number of parking bays affected has been reduced to specic pinch-points.ldquoWe continue to meet with town councils and business representatives and will regularly review the measures to ensure they reflect the changing situation in our shopping centres. In this way we hope to support local businesses while encouraging shoppers towith confidence to town centres.Mr Lush says to add salt to the wound, since parking restrictions have been put in place, he has seen a noticeable decrease in sales, and this Saturday was one of the quietest he has seen.       ,params: .pushldquoWersquove tried our best through lockdown to remain open and serve the town as well as we can, and I find it very sad that this is how wersquove been repaid by the council, he added., compared to now\" alt\"Penarth Times: Glebe Street two weeks ago , compared to now\" class\"editor-image\"Glebe Street two weeks ago , compared to nowEmily Hillier, a resident who regularly drives into the town centre to shop, said she was ldquostunned by the bollards when she arrived to do some shopping on Wednesday.ldquoI wasnrsquot the only one either, she said. ldquoSo many people were saying the same thing ndash stood around just bemused by these plans.ldquoI try to use local shops as much as I can, but Irsquove never felt so discouraged to support local shops as a consumer.ldquoItrsquos so sad that we are being discouraged at a time when these local shops need all the help they can get.Ms Hillier said she believes the council should be using the money to fund parking in the town instead, and should allow Penarthrsquos residents to ldquouse their common sense to socially distance.She added that her friends have driven to the town centre this week, and have gone to the supermarket instead because they couldnrsquot find a parking space.The restrictions have garnered some support in the town too, however, and earlier this week members of Penarth Civic Society and Gwyrddio Penarth Greeningsaid they backed a partial pedestrianisation of some of the major pinch points in the town, to allow eateries to operate outdoors.The topic was on the agenda at a town council meeting two weeks ago, and a survey has been rolled out on the council website asking for residentsrsquo views.Gideon Calder of GPG said: ldquoOur town centre needs our support, and whats vital is that people feel safe to visit, spend more time in our town centre, and make the most of our local shops and cafeacutes.Anne Evans of Penarth Civic Society added: ldquoThese proposals would provide safe pedestrian zones to help increase footfall in the town centre, ensure that there is vital outdoor space for cafeacutes and restaurants, and increase the amount of town centre parking. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Robert Rennie whose address was given as Malmesbury, Wiltshire, had registered himself as the owner of the Common and Crosscommon with Glamorgan County Council.It is believed in some quarters that the claim may be a hoax.But the Parish Council is treating it seriously and has asked the Association of Parish Councilsrsquo solicitors to take up the matter on their behalf.The Parish Council will certainly have unprecedented support from the villagers and many people outside, in their fight.The Common is the home of organised sport in the shape of local rugby and cricket clubs and widely used by local residents and visitors as a popular recreation area.It was at one time owned by the Lord of the Manor, General H. H. Lee.But it has been maintained by the Parish Council out of the local rate fund, ever since they took it over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
