Lithgow will join an all-star cast that features Charlize Theron (left), Nicole Kidman (center) and Australian actress Margot RobbieAccording to Variety, the project is still untitled but other likely characters may include former anchor Greta Van Susteren, media mogul Rupert Murdoch and fired host Bill O\u0027Reilly. Annapurna Pictures will reportedly finance and produce the project and have confirmed that Jay Roach will be directing the piece.  Theron will produce the film alongside Roach, Randolph and Margaret Riley. Lithgow was recently praised for his work as Winston Churchill on Netflix\u0027s The Crown.   It was announced earlier this month that Kidman and Theron will be leading the all-star cast in the movie about former Fox News hosts Carlson and Kelly, who spoke up about sexual harassment at the network before the #MeToo movement kicked off.Trump says hush money payments to porn star and Playboy...Michael Cohen will REFUSE a pardon from \u0027corrupt\u0027 Trump says...Glamorous Egyptian woman who filmed \u0027stalker\u0027 inviting her...Share this articleKidman is to play Carlson, the Stanford and Oxford-educated former Miss America and prominent Fox News anchor who accused Ailes of sexual harassment, the entertainment press reported.\u0027I hope the true story is depicted.

The company routinely loses money and is burning through cash as it ramps up development of its Model 3 sedan, a less-expensive electric car it hopes appeals to the mass market. A large number of investors known as short-sellers have bet against the company.Musk has added to those pressures with lofty projections for profits and production that the automaker often fails live up to.

This was a six-fold increase on the 3,403 children born to Polish mothers in 2005.It was followed by Pakistan (17,099), while Romania (13,717) moved into third place for the first time, fuelled by a surge in adults from the Eastern European arriving in the UK after the employment restrictions were lifted in 2014. It overtook India, which was on 13,476.Some 71,472 babies were born to mothers from the EU in 2017 - up from 44,022 in 2008, or 62 per cent.Including foreign-born fathers, around 1 in 3 babies had at least one parent from overseas. Pakistan was the most common country of birth for fathers born outside the UK with 18,513, followed by Poland (15,610) and India (13,715).Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of think-tank MigrationWatch, which campaigns for tighter controls on migration, said: ‘This is another factor indicating how migration is contributing huge numbers to the population.‘The sound another warning bell about the impact of mass immigration. The consequences of this are increased pressure housing, schools and the NHS and the changing nature of our society.‘This is indicative of the scale and speed that it is all happening and it can’t be in the interests of this country and it is certainly not what the majority of people in this country want.‘The Government must honour its manifesto commitment to reduce net migration to sustainable levels.’Nicola Haines, a statistician for the ONS, said: ‘Just over a third of the babies born in England and Wales in 2017 had at least one parent who had been born outside the UK.          Office for National Statistics numbers for foreign mother births in the UK in 2017 ‘This will include parents who moved to the UK as children and have lived here most of their lives as well as those who have recently migrated. The proportion of live births to non-UK-born parents has been growing since 1990 and is now the highest on record.’The bulletin said: ‘The increases in births to Polish and Romanian-born mothers are driven mainly by the increasing size of the Polish and Romanian-born populations living in the UK.’The ONS said the figures showed that fertility levels were higher among foreign-born women and such women were more likely to be of childbearing age than the rest of the population.In some parts of the UK, 75 per cent of children were born to foreign mothers in 2017. In Brent, North-West London, it was 75.7 per cent while in the East London borough of Newham, the proportion was 74.1 per cent.Slough in Berkshire had the highest percentage outside London at 62.8 per cent followed by Luton with 59.3 per cent.However, the ONS paper also revealed that the Total Fertility Rate - which predicts how many children a typical woman would have in their lifetime on current patterns - fell to 1.71 children per foreign-born woman, the lowest level since 2005.Yesterday  the Mail told how a new report claimed that babies born to foreign-born migrants had contributed to the unprecedented surge in Britain’s population this century.Some 82 per cent of the huge rise from 2001 to 2016 could be attributed to the arrival of immigrants and, subsequently, their UK-born children, according to an analysis of ONS data by MigrationWatch.It claimed that of the 6.6million extra people added to the population during those 15 years, 5.4million were the result of mass immigration - the biggest ever wave of incomers.Because the ONS failed to count 2.3million children born to foreign parents as migrants - giving a lower total of 3.1million, or 47 per cent of the rise - the effect of migration policy was not calculated correctly, it said.The ONS said that in accordance with internationally recognised definitions, children born in the UK were not counted as migrants.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/08/4F59916B00000578-6093755-image-a-2_1535096838074.jpg","title":"Bull flaming horns gores woman Spanish festival","story":"    A bull gored a woman (pictured above) during a traditional Spanish event where the animal\u0027s horns are set on fire          Footage from the scene shows the animal charge at the woman (pictured above), who has not been named, and lifting her into the air by the horns before she crashes to the ground          The toro embolado town festival, translated as \u0027bull with balls\u0027 in Sumacarcer, in the eastern Spanish region of Valencia, involves the animal being fitted with wooden balls on its horns which are then set alightFootage shows event organisers cruelly lighting the bull\u0027s horns and setting it loose within the arena as spectators look on from behind metal fences.As the bull runs across the arena a young woman, who was reportedly taking photos, emerges at the far end of the arena and is tossed into the air by the animal.Man dies after trying to protect his wife from a rampaging...Sickening moment tourist is gored by enraged bull after...Share this articleAs the audience screams in horror, several spectators are seen running over to the aid of the injured woman who now lies on the ground and cautiously move her out of harms way.The injured woman was attended to by local paramedics before being rushed to the Lluis Alcanyis Hospital in the nearby city of Xativa.           The Spanish festival is celebrated in many towns across the country but is particularly popular in the Valencian and Southern Catalonian community          As the audience screams in horror, several spectators are seen running over to the aid of the woman who now lies on the ground and cautiously move her out of harms way.

It was something to do with filling that loss. She was my  angel’My grandmother, who raised me, was a stern woman of very few words. She believed in strong discipline. But she was also a devoted caregiver. Growing up, she would dress me in Baby Jane ruffled dresses and braid my hair into two twists with ribbons and hair ballies. On the morning of this photo, which I took in 2005, she did my hair again, just like she did when I was a child.Every Saturday afternoon, around the same time each week, she would tend to her porcelain dolls. She must have had hundreds, all in different sizes, different outfits, different nationalities. It was like the UN of porcelain dolls in her living room.She began collecting them when my aunt – her daughter – was murdered. It was something to do with filling that loss. But it was also about pride. Despite growing up in a hard, industrial town like the one I grew up in, I never felt poor. The care she expended on them taught me that, no matter what the circumstances outside were like, we should always take care of ourselves. She taught me that we had value.I set up the camera and the moment she came into the frame, I moved in, sat next to her and asked her to look at the lens. I had no idea what her expression was, I just turned and pressed the shutter release – you can see it in my right hand. In 14 years of documenting my family and my home town, this was one of thefew times my grandmother cooperated. For that alone, this shot is immensely special to me.To this day, I’m profoundly grateful to her. She was a  and an angel to me. She had the foresight and knowledge of how to keep me alive and safe during a very tumultuous, difficult time.Braddock is an industrial town in Pennsylvania, nine miles outside of Pittsburgh. By the time I was born in 1982, most of the steel mills had already closed. The unions were broken up, most companies had gone overseas and the town was abandoned, on every level: local, state and federal. Yet the land bore the marks of what had gone before: it had been poisoned by industry, and the men and women of Braddock were paying the price. They still are.My grandmother died of cancer, my mother has battled cancer and I have lupus. Much of my childhood and my grandmother’s later years were spent looking after my step-great-grandfather who worked in the factories. It ruined his body, it ruined his health, and the only healthcare he received was from the women of my family.It’s a story that rings true across America. Women create the very possibility of a workforce, not only by giving birth to the men who work in heavy industry, but by caring for them when that industry destroys them. Their story gets written out of history, doubly so when they are black.Today the working class is, once again, being spoken about as if it were exclusively white. And yet African Americans have always worked in these industries. They have never been deemed deserving of representation by most of the photographers whose work has lasted.If you want to talk about America or US politics, you’ve just got to look at this little town. Despite the hardship, people from Braddock, including my grandmother, are proud of where they come from. It’s the belly of the beast, it’s the backbone of this country. It’s home to Andrew Carnegie’s first factory and his first library. People in these small towns are always much further ahead than people in the cities – or the media – assume. For the first time in Braddock, an African-American democratic socialist woman in her 30s has been elected to the state legislature of the 34th district. Her name is Summer Lee. She unseated a white man from a political dynasty which had been dominant since we were born, and she won by a landslide. By the end of my life’s work, I hope to have created an archive that shows just how erse the working class is and who the workers are. I want to show how their lives have been impacted by the fact that corporations have more rights than human beings in this country. I want to show the fullness of the working class, because it’s not just synonymous with whiteness.Studied: “Master of fine arts, Syracuse University.”Influences: “Allan Sekula, Martha Rosler, Carrie Mae Weems and Dawoud Bey.”High point: “Receiving the MacArthur fellowship in 2015.”Low point: “When my mentor Kathe Kowalski passed away in 2006.”Top tip: “Let your photographs be your compass, always follow where your photographs lead you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/080463030db1e78e5a89d1ce4782751ffe53d5f8/0_729_5392_3236/master/5392.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ba441e711bd58db836e1e3602b60709","title":"ashmoleon spellbound anish kapoor the week in art","story":"The Ashmoleon is conjuring up dark magic, Anish Kapoor is tricking the eye and the cosmos reveals its unfathomable beauty – all in our weekly dispatchSpellboundA delve into the dark world of magic and witchcraft, full of strange and curious objects including the paraphernalia of Elizabeth I’s conjurer Dr John Dee.• Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, 31 August to 6 January.DragRobert Mapplethorpe, Cindy Sherman and others star in a survey of self-portraiture as the fashioning of identity.• Hayward Gallery, London, until 14 October.The Art of CampariFancy a drink?

Overhead locker space has failed to match demand, with an increasing number of passengers adapting their packing habits to escape baggage charges on budget carriers. Passengers will still be allowed to carry on one small bag that can fit under a seat in front, free of charge. A limited number of passengers who book priority boarding – which costs £6 or €6 per flight – will be able to take on a small case as hand luggage.However, Ryanair is introducing a lower rate for smaller, checked-in baggage. Passengers will pay £8 – rather than £25 – for any case weighing less than 10kg.Ryanair said the change would be revenue neutral, as many people would switch to checking in a cheaper, smaller suitcase, and was aimed purely at reducing delays to flights caused by too much luggage at the boarding gate. The overhead lockers on Ryanair’s Boeing 737 fleet can accommodate about 100 suitcases, while the number of priority tickets sold will be capped at 95 – roughly half the maximum passengers per flight. The size limit of the small, free bag has also been slightly increased, but anyone who fails to fit that bag in the sizer at the airport will be charged £25 or €25 and have the bag put in the hold. Ryanair has long grappled to find the best solution to its baggage issues. Its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, imposed high checked-in baggage fees for many years in an effort to keep down handling costs, claiming to be doing customers and the environment a favour by encouraging passengers to travel light. The first change imposed in January saw small carry-on cases taken at the gate and put in the aircraft hold for free, with only passengers who had booked priority boarding, then £5, allowed to put cases in the cabin’s overhead lockers. The move was accepted with equanimity by passengers but did not solve the gate delays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e6ffe5507f18bcd2c93792b22f5612ff7aab3c/12_246_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b3afd74c2c71d6e461a911c8cbc5d19","title":"mortgage lending fell in july before rise in interest rates","story":"Mortgage lending in Britain dropped last month before the Bank of England raised interest rates above the level set since the financial crisis, new banking industry figures show.

Peter Tyler, a director at UK Finance, said: “The broader economic outlook remains mixed, with households continuing to see their incomes being squeezed by rising inflation.”House-price growth across the country has been slowing in recent months, with property values in London falling for the first time since the financial crisis.

However, a government-appointed commission has rejected the proposal, warning that a less erse investment strategy would have major consequences for the fund’s returns.“A sale of energy stocks would challenge the current investment strategy of the fund, with broad ersification of the investments and a high threshold for exclusion,” the commission said on Friday.The Government Pension Fund Global was built off the oil and gas revenues that have made Norway rich.It also has major holdings in international oil firms, including $6.14bn in Shell, followed by billions of dollars invested in other oil majors such as BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total. It has smaller stakes in the Italian oil firm Eni, the US oil firm ConocoPhillips and the US oil services group Schlumberger. Most oil company share prices have climbed in the past year along with crude prices.Divesting those stocks was “not an effective insurance” against the “substantial” hit Norway faced to its tax take if its oil and gas sector was hurt by an oil price crash, the commission argued. The commission, headed by the economist Øystein Thøgersen, said the fund’s existing investment strategy was “simple, well founded and has served the fund well”.Nicolò Wojewoda, the Europe team leader at the climate campaign group 350.org, said: “This summer Nordic heatwaves, wildfires in the Arctic Circle and alarming news of the thickest Arctic sea ice starting to break up, have brought climate change so close to home for Norway. It seems unthinkable to continue to invest in companies that have caused this chaos.”The government said a final decision would be made this autumn.Norway’s state-owned oil company Statoil earlier this year rebranded itself as Equinor, to reflect what it said was its new role as a “broad energy company”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234180e7b5a58efdaf9333d98ddb9820bcecbca6/716_947_4468_2680/master/4468.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b02c72253d5e077bc14aaef7a35da6e1","title":"uzbekistan secret underground tashkent metro in pictures","story":"After the ban on photographing the Tashkent metro in Uzbekistan was lifted this summer, Amos Chapple, RFERL’s photographer went underground to reveal the art, architecture and nuclear-blast protection in Central Asia’s oldest subway system"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3f7b7a1b11d191ab7ffc64f2bcdb1933764190/0_0_4734_2841/master/4734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bded5516e88724442a0025cd4498e936","title":"calm amid the concrete britains best urban green spaces","story":"From shopping centre beehives to grand hidden gardens, there’s respite from the madding crowds in Britain’s towns and citiesDalston Eastern Curve Garden, LondonThis leafy lifeline, situated slap bang in the middle of Dalston’s lively chicken shops, boutique bars and technicolor nail salons, is a vital addition to one of London’s most densely populated boroughs, where few people have access to their own garden. Created in 2010 on the site of the old Eastern Curve railway line, it has a vegetable and herb patch, a pizza oven and a greenhouse used for workshops in the winter months.Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden, LeedsDespite the name, Hyde Park in Leeds has one of the lowest ratios of green space to grey (built-up environments) in the UK, which is why the Bedford Fields Community Forest Garden is so loved by students and locals alike. Whether edible or medicinal, all of the plants here have a use, and visitors are encouraged to take what they find – with a request that they give something back to the initiative in their spare time. A word of advice: take one of their foraging courses before you go picking the mushrooms.Crook Hall, DurhamFirm favourites of Dorothy and William Wordsworth, and John Ruskin – and those guys knew a thing or two about nature – the wild garden of one of the oldest houses in Durham has two hectares of wildflower meadows, an ivy-hung courtyard, a maze, and even a moat.

Brexit secretary Dominic Raab launched the first of the government’s “technical notices” on Thursday, explaining how to prepare for Brexit in the event of no-deal with the EU, but was greeted with a renewed chorus of panic from the CBI, the TUC, farmers, NHS, financiers – all but those blinded by Brexitmania.Raab was eager to pretend these 24 documents would have little effect on ordinary people. “These are for business,” he said, sounding like Harold Wilson making his notorious reassurance that “the pound in your pocket has not been devalued”. But the notices make clear that if no deal is reached by the time we leave on 29 March 2019, the UK faces a mountain of crisis, wrapped in burgeoning blankets of new bureaucracy. Look what businesses need to do: as well as customs declarations for goods from the EU, they must employ customs brokers, freight forwarders and logistics providers with all necessary software and authorisations. Each must register for a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification number, with higher costs and slower processing times for euro transactions. And yes, there will be new tariffs.This hardly encourages all those businesses Liam Fox urges to start exporting. Nor will it “only” affect business when lorries are backed halfway up Britain. Add in 1,000 extra border staff and 9,000 extra civil servants, and where is that bonfire of red tape the Brexiters promised?However carefully Raab tries to cotton-wool these warnings, today brought an avalanche of reminders of the dire Brexit effects we have already been told about. Supermarket CEOs say shelves will be emptied as a third of food is imported from the EU. Health secretary Matt Hancock tells drug companies to stockpile an extra six weeks’ worth of drugs – but warns hospitals and patients not to panic-buy, for fear of running short. The City is rumbling with Brexit warnings amid movements to other EU capitals. The 300,000 expat pensioners living in Europe are warned that no deal may threaten their pensions and healthcare. Even small parcels from the EU will incur VAT, and credit card charges will rise for visitors to the EU. Police warn of the risk of losing data exchanges on EU crime. Who knew until these notices that no deal means a stoppage of Danish sperm bank donations? Jacob Rees-Mogg calls all this “absurdly overstated”, yet Raab has admitted that even “no deal” needs basic agreement on ports, banking, data – or disaster follows. Naturally, Northern Ireland’s border remains unresolved. Traders must consult Dublin. “We will provide more information in due course.” Ah! We are still full steam ahead for the Irish iceberg on which Boris Johnson’s “titanic success of Brexit” will founder.Raab is treading a wobbling tightrope. Believe it or not, he like Jeremy Hunt is a Tory leadership supplicant, he an original leaver, Hunt an erstwhile remainer, both now zigzagging. All they say is refracted through the distorting mirror of pleasing the tiny band of decrepit Tory party members. So zigzag Raab promises no change to worker rights, yet hastens to add that regulations will “erge over time”, “when it’s right for the British people”. On the one hand they both want to sound prime ministerially pragmatic, unlike the irresponsible madcap fanatic Johnson. They want to bring home the Brexit bacon – even if Danish is off the menu – with a deal to satisfy the mouth-foamers, without causing economic cataclysm. This, as Theresa May now knows, is impossible.That impossibilism is now becoming clearer to most voters. The more ministers parrot May’s nonsensical claim that “no deal is better than a bad deal”, the more obvious it becomes that every brand of Brexit deal is far worse than no Brexit.Why this change of mind? The Brexit threat has been hammered home by the misjudgment of the Brexiters themselves. It was they who demanded the government publish plans for “no deal” damage limitation, as proof to the enemy across the Channel that Britain can go it alone. But as soon as the government started laying plans out, Brexiters cried foul: the mandarins are launching Project Fear again! There’s no pleasing these insatiables – and there never will be. Because every Brexit outcome will be bad, they will always need to blame the betrayers, the appeasers and she who the ranters call Treason May.As a tactic, Brexiters have reprised the cold war dilemma. When nuclear policy depends on the principle of mutually assured destruction, it has to be unthinkable to both sides that anyone would ever press the button. Yet at the same time, the other side must believe you just might. In 1980, as Russia was invading Afghanistan, the government sabre-rattled by publishing civil defence leaflets telling citizens how to prepare for a nuclear war: what to do when the warnings sound, how to construct a fallout shelter or a fallout room, what food and water you need for 14 days and what makeshift toilet arrangements. It didn’t frighten the Russians but it terrified enough citizens here into a great CND revival.No one suggests the cataclysm of Brexit compares to nuclear annihilation – but the tactical thinking is the same. In trying to frighten the enemy, all the Brexiters have done is terrify their own side. People are at last hearing the news of what no deal – and indeed almost any kind of Brexit – will really mean for everyday life, rather than the sunlit promised land of Brexlandia. Even Rees-Mogg has admitted we may not reach that place for half a century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eded7aab67ed649f2bbab36ec284e82cb024397/0_31_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dbfb0cd95f540d15f87a93ea79d3ed4","title":"class bias media cv spectator jeremy corbyn interns","story":"Jeremy Corbyn may have a point about class bias in the media, but publishing social class audits of staff, as he suggests the BBC should do, is unlikely to achieve much. There are better ways to address the issue.At the Spectator we have discovered that internships are key. We see about two dozen interns a year and we don’t ask for their CVs or conduct interviews. Winning a place is down to aptitude alone. We set tasks (writing blogs, doing research) and pick the best entries.The first of this year’s interns arrived in our office last month. Two stood out immediately – a woman who had decided to retrain as a journalist in her mid-30s and a teenager. Both had submitted first-rate applications that were, frankly, better than anything I’d be able to do.Like most of our interns, they were dazzlingly bright, with a scary knowledge across a wide range of subjects. The first turned out to be an Oxford-educated classics don and the teenager, we discovered after selection, had scored three Es at A-level.It was soon apparent that the teenager’s exam results reflected nothing more than the fact he had been going through a tough period. But that’s the problem with judging people by academic output: this A-level snapshot – a handful of grades taken from just a few short months of your life – decides university and, perhaps, the path you then take. British universities produce some of the best graduates in the world, but they are only a fraction of the talent available in the country.We rejected CVs so that we can hire people from a deeper pool of talent, not out of a sense of do-gooding. No one, ever, is hired as an act of charity or social outreach. Journalism is about reflecting and reporting on the wider world, so it makes sense to avoid going for the same sort of person with the same sort of background. Of my senior colleagues now, one was a King’s scholar at Eton. Another left school at 16. It has never tended to matter. Frank Johnson, a former editor, had very little formal education. Accountants and medics need professional training, but many lines of work only require enthusiasm and an ability to learn. Our aptitude test helps us pick out the people who can do just that.Crucially, the test aims not to discriminate in any way – and that includes reverse discrimination against the wealthy. Attempts to analyse anyone’s social class are, anyway, notoriously hard. Take the latest recruit from our internship scheme, Cindy Yu, our podcast editor. She was a store manager at Lidl before joining the Spectator: does that give you a mental picture of her? But before that she completed a master’s in Chinese studies at Oxford. She went to an elite grammar, which might underline another prejudice. But only for sixth form: she was at a standard comprehensive beforehand, after emigrating here from China at the age of 10.This is why we don’t seek to assess interns for social class after they arrive: it’s hard to pin anyone down. Not to say intrusive. And the biggest surprise to me has not been the schools people have gone to or their social class, but their age. One of our best interns last year was a 48-year-old mother of three who had sacrificed a career to raise a family. But as her children grew older, she wanted to see if it was too late to start something new. She was brilliant and now works at the Sunday Times: a career she might not have launched had she been judged by the CV credentialism that narrows the recruitment choices of so many employers. Another great intern was a former teacher, who wanted a career change. After lighting up the sky with the articles she wrote while with us, she now works at the National Review in New York.There is no doubt that the media does tend to recruit from the upper-middle class – and that, if you see two writers with the same surname, the odds are that they’re related. There are a great many reasons for this, but one is the way in which internships are handed out informally as a favour to friends, contacts, or someone in the management. These internships are golden opportunities, a chance to make contacts if you have none. Yes, ours are paid – but unpaid internships are not as much of a problem as unofficial ones. The right to give them out – for example, to a friend who may be looking to help their own child – is a perk of the job that quite a few people high up in all kinds of organisations would defend to the death. It’s not uncommon to see internships sold at charity auctions to the highest bidder.The Spectator does have a few rules. We only take interns who might be available to work in two years, because we’re serious about seeking to hire them. We take teenagers through the Social Mobility Foundation (on whose board I sit). We throw out anyone who, in their application letter, drops a hint that they are at Oxbridge, thinking it might help (“I write for my student newspaper, Cherwell”). But our aim is like any other employer: to attract the best talent Britain has to offer.It’s quite right that newspapers and television companies, who use the same old recruitment schemes, worry about ersity. They need to widen their net. Ditching CVs might be a good way to start.• Fraser Nelson is editor of the Spectator and a columnist for the Daily "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/297a29251f1dfbeffd42cffde3e632cd471fd715/0_488_4700_2821/master/4700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fae9043ee13996de4742f8dc289e5b31","title":"labour party split sdp tories england","story":"I know a thing or two about new parties. I joined the SDP as a founder member a few days after my 18th birthday in 1981. I was a councillor, activist and parliamentary candidate for the SDP and its successor party, the Liberal Democrats, for 14 years before joining Labour when Tony Blair became leader and abolished Labour’s old clause IV – committing to general nationalisation – in 1995.The SDP’s founder, Roy Jenkins, was my hero and later mentor. The most transformational liberal home secretary ever, he legalised both homosexuality and abortion in one of the most skilful ministerial manoeuvres of parliamentary history. Roy was a standard bearer of a generation of pro-Europeans, Britain’s only president of the European commission, and a brilliant biographer. I read his awesome Asquith at the age of 14 and still regard him as the best prime minister Britain never had. There is no potential leader of a new party today with remotely comparable credibility.But in retrospect the SDP was born to fail. Roy would have done better simply to have joined the Liberals and become their leader in 1981. In its only serious contest – 1983 – the SDP, in alliance with the Liberals, did only marginally better than had the Liberals in their Jeremy Thorpe-led surge in 1974. It was rapidly downhill thereafter as Labour regrouped under Neil Kinnock and John Smith.“Breaking the mould” – the SDP’s slogan – is hellishly difficult in Britain’s first-past-the-post parliamentary system because the hurdle is so high. Ignore the apparent lessons of Macron – the French have a presidential system, and he had the luck of the gods. Ignore Labour’s rise – that took 50 years, two world wars, a split in the Liberal party, a disastrous coalition between half of the Liberals and the Tories and even then the Liberals refused to die and Labour has only infrequently, and fairly precariously, held power since the 1920s. Ignore too Scotland, where the SNP – another party with a 50-year rise – is a regional force in a nation where the Tories have historically always been weak.Focus on just one thing: the Conservative party in England. Unless the Tory party splits – which it has done but once in the last 200 years, over the repeal of the Corn Laws 170 years ago – a new party is doomed because the Tories are England’s dominant nationalist party and a supremely successful cultural and electoral behemoth. Consider. Since 1900 the Tories have been in office for 78 of the 118 years. In that time there have been 14 Tory prime ministers, three Liberal and six Labour – and two of those Liberals and one Labour ended up heading largely Tory governments and were destroyed by them.Labour and the Liberals have never joined in a coalition without the Tories also in the mix. Since 1945 the Liberals have been in office once, with the Tories, and that consumed Nick Clegg and nearly his party too.For those toying with a centre party because of Brexit – Brexit is happening because of an extreme English nationalism unleashed by the Tories’ most dominant leader since 1945, Margaret Thatcher, and nurtured by disciples including Nigel Farage. Split the opposition and Brexit is certain. The Conservatives are by far the most successful democratic party in Europe, apart possibly from Sweden’s social democrats, because they have synthesised democracy and nationalism to a unique degree in Europe’s historically largest homogeneous nation, England.There are very deep social roots. England’s dominant schools, universities, professions and enterprises are largely in the ideological and filial grip of the Conservative party. This isn’t always obvious but it is emphatic, especially when they are threatened. In England, new parties don’t work, but reverse takeovers of existing parties sometimes do – Thatcher of the Tories, Blair and Corbyn of Labour, Clegg and his orange-bookers of the Lib Dems. Ukip is essentially a Farage reverse takeover of the Tories, so successful that I would not bet against Farage yet becoming a Tory MP and the party’s leader.The Conservatives have been unusually badly led by David Cameron and Theresa May. But May will be gone soon. Unless the Tory party splits – and I see no sign of it – a new party will almost certainly fail to break through.Roy Jenkins understood this. He told me after 1983 that the failure to attract Tory MPs – only one joined – was the SDP’s crucial weakness. Ironically one of his closest friends was the leader of the Tory wets of the 1980s – Sir Ian Gilmour – but Gilmour was a baronet, his wife had been a bridesmaid of the Queen, and it was socially impossible for him to leave the Tories. It is the same today with Tory “wets” such as Tom Tugendhat, Philip Hammond, Dominic Grieve and David Lidington.A footnote.

This will culminate in a huge show of political and public strength in central London, where more than 100,000 people marched for the same reason back in June.Our joint cause focuses on the political ascendancy. Polls are now consistently showing that more people support a vote than reject it – and the gap continues to grow. This is despite what we all know, that the nation is fed up with talking about Brexit – a word that the lexicon of British daily life cannot relinquish a moment too soon.What we are urging is one last big push to secure the vote this country sorely needs, a vote that includes the option of a U-turn on Brexit.In 2016 the referendum result set us on the road to Brexit. What the destination looked like was never seriously explained we only had the wildest dreams of the most extreme leave fantasists to go on.Destination Brexit is still a matter of dispute, a subject of bitter disagreement even among the Conservative ideologues themselves. But as we draw closer, authoritative figures and bodies have become more convinced of the economic damage that will be wrought. Concerns have been raised over hospitals that will be shorn of medicines and staff, and preparations for the grim prospect of food shortages. What’s more, no one voted for the fudged Chequers compromise that the government finally cobbled together to get past a fractured cabinet.David Cameron was willing to risk our country’s future on a referendum to settle the Conservative civil war over Europe that had raged for decades, a gamble that set us on the road to Brexit. Theresa May, and for that matter Jeremy Corbyn, must now have the courage to let the British people have the final say when we have some idea of what Brexit looks and feels like.We must, though, learn from the 2016 referendum. Neither side covered themselves in glory, and talk of immediate Armageddon over a leave result was preposterous.But some statements made by the leave campaign were misleading at best, and calculated lies at worst – the most infamous being the £350m Brexit idend for the NHS, and that hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Turkey, which is far from even joining the EU, would somehow overwhelm the UK.What will be necessary for the People’s Vote is an independent arbiter to be appointed who can rule on whether such claims are correct and valid. Those found to be conjuring “facts” from thin air would be forced to publicly withdraw them and apologise. Moreover, now that we know there was Russian interference in the 2016 referendum, we must make sure this vote is fought cleanly, and is completely untainted.Both sides would, of course, have to agree to this appointment.We do not claim that people weren’t smart enough to make up their own minds about Brexit in 2016. They were, and the country was clearly ided fairly evenly.But those who were torn between the arguments, whichever way they ended up voting, rightly feel cheated by the mess the government has made of Brexit. Any vote on the final deal – or, heaven forbid, no deal – is for them.Those of us of differing political hues must work together to make sure we secure that vote. Tribal loyalties are being put to one side to fight for this common goal.This is why we have written this article together: a Liberal Democrat whose political training began in the rough and tumble of 1970s Glasgow as a Labour councillor, and the only modern-day Conservative MP whose office boasted a picture of Edward Heath rather than Margaret Thatcher.Conservative, Lib Dem, Labour, Green or whoever else wants to join us: we are in this together and will secure the People’s Vote you deserve.• Vince Cable is leader of the Liberal Democrats Neil Carmichael is president of Conservatives for a People’s Vote"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34e906e0c4f301a92a0ea4edd72552e58decc293/0_34_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35cb76817a2312938b7fe9b80c139e0f","title":"kalashnikov takes on tesla with retro look electric supercar","story":"Russian arms maker says cutting edge elements will ensure it can take on Elon Musk’s brandThe Russian arms maker Kalashnikov has unveiled its new electric car, inspired by a rare 1970s model, saying the technology will rival Elon Musk’s Tesla.The brand, best known for the AK-47 machine gun, on Thursday presented the retro-looking pale blue prototype, the CV-1, at a defence expo outside Moscow.The look was inspired by a Soviet hatchback model developed in the 1970s called “Izh-Kombi”, according to a statement on the Kalashnikov website.Its holding company, Kalashnikov Concern, said it had developed cutting-edge elements for the “electric supercar”, including a “revolutionary” inverter. The vehicle can travel 217 miles (350km) on one charge.“This technology will let us stand in the ranks of global electric car producers such as Tesla and be their competitor,” RIA-Novosti quoted the Kalashnikov press office as saying.“We were inspired by the experience of global market leaders in developing our concept.”Kalashnikov has long been trying to expand its brand, recently launching lines of clothing and other civilian merchandise ranging from umbrellas to mobile phone covers.Its foray into electric vehicles, however, was met with mixed reactions from Russians. Comments to the news on the company’s official Facebook page ranged from “cyberpunk” to “Izh-Zombie”.“Your tanks are great, but it would be better if you stayed away from cars,” one user wrote.Earlier this week, online users ridiculed Kalashnikov’s new bipedal combat robot.

Significantly, climate change is happening almost twice as fast in high mountains as compared to the rest of the planet.“Whilst there are many theories as to why this is happening, we don’t fully understand what’s going on,” says Mourey. What is not disputed, though, is that many climbing routes have been drastically altered by climate change.“A 1970s climbing and mountaineering guidebook to the 100 best routes around Mont Blanc isn’t useable any more as most of the routes have changed and can’t be used,” he says.The trails to the high mountain huts around Mont Blanc which are used by climbers are becoming more dangerous too, forcing the authorities to adapt and take action.In 2012 the trail to the Conscrits hut was judged to have become too dangerous following increasing numbers of rockfalls, so a 60m Himalayan-style suspension bridge was built to make access to the hut safer.A completely new trail, including the installation of fixed ladders, has recently had to be built to the Charpoua hut following the melting of glaciers which made the previous trail too difficult and dangerous.Given Chamonix’s status as the cradle of modern mountaineering and alpine pursuits, the authorities are now making a determined effort to adapt to these changing conditions to ensure that climbing can continue.“We want to support the idea that alpinism and its values are not dead and we must keep on climbing safely,” says Claude Jacot, a Chamonix councillor and head of mountain safety for the region.But for some, the area is already becoming too dangerous.“This year we’ve deliberately reduced our programmes on Mont Blanc due to the increased rockfall caused by higher temperatures over the last few years,” says Ed Chard from trekking operator Jagged Globe.So what will happen to climbing around Chamonix in the coming years? Mourey is optimistic that the sport still has a future in the Alps, but future mountaineers will have to adapt.“You’ll still be able to climb in the future – you’ll just have to change the way you climb,” he says. “If anyone doesn’t believe that climate change exists, they should come to Chamonix to see it for themselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3208be3b469da1f21e2ce3dfe39f5e9f6f7d83db/0_167_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=456be87989f8a73be3c5f004941ef7cf","title":"kelp dredging proposal criticised by conservationists scotland","story":"Use of mechanical device to pull kelp plants from beds would destroy local ecosystem, say campaignersA proposal to mechanically dredge kelp forests off the coast of Scotland has led to an outcry from conservationists, who say it would destroy local ecosystems.Ayr-based company Marine Biopolymers has approached Marine Scotland to apply for a licence to use a comb-like device that pulls entire kelp plants from the bed. In order to inform the environmental appraisal required by Marine Scotland, Marine Biopolymers has published a report describing the potential environmental impacts to be researched further for a full assessment. Public comment on this report is open until Friday 24 August, and various stakeholders have expressed concern over the proposals. “Kelp habitats are vital ecosystems that absorb the power of waves along stormy coasts, lock up millions of tonnes of carbon every year and provide shelter for hundreds of species,” said Calum Duncan of the Marine Conservation Society.“This scoping report is only the first stage of an extensive consultation process,” said a statement issued by Marine Biopolymers. “The next stage is the full environmental survey, which will be carried out by internationally renowned scientists.”Ailsa McLellan, who harvests kelp by hand, is concerned about the precedent set by granting a licence to Marine Biopolymers, given the lack of legislation protecting wild seaweed from unsustainable harvesting: “Even if they’re the most careful company in the world, there’s no pressure on anyone else to do it that way.” There is also a conflict with the strict rules applied to hand harvesters, she added: “I have to record every single invertebrate bycatch. It can’t be one rule for us tiny operators and they’re allowed to go at it with a dredge.”The Marine Conservation Society supports the exploration of more sustainable alternatives to dredging. “Mechanically stripping swaths of pristine kelp forest clean from the reef at the scale proposed simply cannot be considered sustainable,” said Duncan. “We would urge a complete rethink and lower impact alternatives, such as managed hand-gathering and seaweed culture, to be explored instead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d993923fda3e588b16025126bc66e3fc1b9358f/0_0_2893_1735/master/2893.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c6c3872d74c357ddc7af726653fd737","title":"divine bikini emoji fashion trends","story":"What’s hot and what’s not in fashion this weekDivine For hanging out posthumously with Frank Ocean.

They seem to be attracting big audiences – but are they any good?The death knell of the Hollywood romcom has sounded repeatedly over the past few years, as contrived meet-cutes, airport-based declarations of love and Kate Hudson have become conspicuously absent from cinema screens. Its decline has been pinned on various culprits: the disappearance of the mid-budget movie, young actors’ reluctance to star in them (old actors, too: earlier this year Hugh Grant announced his retirement from the genre) and the glut of below-par abominations at the turn of this decade (Just Go With It, Couples Retreat, When in Rome, The Back-Up Plan, to name a few). But whatever the reasons, it is clear that the studio romcom’s heyday is over.It doesn’t mean people stopped craving warm, fuzzy, slightly dotty depictions of romance. As Hollywood disassembled its romantic machinery, Netflix was keenly observing the viewing habits of its subscribers, and noticed that 80 million of its users had watched a romcom in the past year. Cue its self-proclaimed “summer of love”, a torrent of romcoms that continues the streaming platform’s strategy of flooding the market with new content (it plans to release 80 original films in 2018 and has 700 shows in the works) with seemingly little care for what that content contains.It may be a wise move: viewing figures certainly look swoonsome. But Netflix’s scatter-gun approach – whether you are in the mood for Christmas, crying or cruises, it has a romcom for you – feels cynical and crude. Is it in danger of dragging an already-maligned genre deeper into the dirt? Wading through its offerings seems to be the only way to find out.It is, however, refreshing to have a blossoming relationship between an Asian-American woman and African-American man as the focus of a romcom, a genre hitherto populated almost exclusively by white people.Judging by its current roster, Netflix movies don’t need star power in the way big studio projects tend to, which means the platform is able to foster new talent. To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before, an adaptation from a YA novel, starring Lana Condor as an Asian-American girl whose stash of secret love letters are mysteriously sent to her crushes, has received breathless acclaim. But this praise feels strangely out of step with the film: a bland story of a sweet adolescent girl’s search for love. It is a sign of how low the bar is set for Netflix’s romcom rescue.Once I have seen the next film on my list, however, I would happily front the To All the Boys Oscar campaign. The Kissing Booth is so banal that its repeated references to the oeuvre of John Hughes (including a Molly Ringwald cameo) feel alarmingly deluded. It has nevertheless been crowned “movie hit of the summer” by the New York Times, while Netflix head honcho Ted Sarandos depressingly revealed it as “one of the most-watched movies in the country, and maybe in the world”.Following a teenage girl whose crush on her best friend’s older brother turns out to be reciprocated, it is dull – the non-storyline drags on for what feels like centuries – and offensively sexist in the way it casually objectifies its protagonist. In fact, The Kissing Booth’s existence only starts to make sense once you hear that it is based on a story by a 15-year-old girl from Wales: it’s a cringeworthy American high-school fantasy that reeks of adolescent wish-fulfilment.But at least it was clearly written by a human – which is more than can be said for A Christmas Prince, which seems to have been generated by a computer exposed to The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. Plot-wise, it follows Amber, a wannabe reporter sent to cover royal upheaval in the kingdom of Aldovia. Faced with little access, she disguises herself as the princess’s tutor (a wise child who spends most of her time in a wheelchair and seems to have been beamed in from the 1940s) and soon grows close to the future king. In December, Netflix caused controversy with a tweet that read: “To the 53 people who’ve watched A Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days: Who hurt you?” If the film is so bad that Netflix can troll its own users for watching it (and it is), objective quality is clearly not something the streaming giant is concerned about a sequel subtitled The Royal Wedding is set to be released this Christmas.While the Hollywood romcom has declined, the genre itself is thriving elsewhere – in indie films (The Big Sick, Obvious Child) and in TV series, thanks to shows such as Love, Catastrophe, The Mindy Project and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. While the latter are able to mine emotional depths and explode the happily-ever-after formula with their extended run-times and slowly unravelling characters, Netflix’s by-the-book romcoms tend to adhere to a strict structural rhythm, and often seem engineered to pretend those kind of developments never happened. But they are influenced by the small screen in a different way.Martha Shearer, a film professor of King’s College London, thinks Netflix is attempting to draw on the continued success of made-for-TV movies, particularly in the case of A Christmas Prince and the similarly trite Christmas Inheritance. Which prompts the question – is a Netflix romcom even a proper film? It has been cattily observed that the site’s original movies all have one thing in common: they aren’t good enough for release in cinemas. Or, as Vulture put it in a review of romcom Ibiza, these are films “one can’t imagine possibly being written to be exhibited on any other platform”.That’s not strictly true – one Netflix summer of love offering, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, is now in cinemas across the UK (with Netflix presumably banking on the fact that the British find posh people of the past so overwhelmingly appealing that they will pay to see them stutter when no one else will). But, in general, these films do make more sense if one thinks of the Netflix romcom as a separate entity from conventional cinema – a free product churned out to fill a gap in the market and an hour in the day, rather than something to lure people into expensive cinema seats.That the Netflix romcom has no need to mark itself out from the crowd may explain why many of Netflix’s “originals” feel almost deliberately derivative.Like Father, which features Kristen Bell and Kelsey Grammer bonding on a cruise ship, does subvert the genre by subbing in a love story between career-obsessed protagonist Rachel and her estranged dad for the traditional romance, but so many parts of it are familiar (Bell playing a heartless protagonist, the luxury holiday setting, Team Apatow supporting cast members) that it feels like a knockoff of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Bell’s bona fide 2008 romcom hit. In Ibiza, about one girl’s quest to bag an attractive Scottish DJ, Gillian Jacobs’ dysfunctional, drug-addled character seems to be lifted wholesale from her TV series, Love. And with its scrambled timeline and Zooey Deschanel-alike lead, Happy Anniversary is eerily reminiscent of 500 Days of Summer.These similarities suggest that Netflix is happy to focus on the outward signifiers of the genre’s success at the expense of the harder-to-nail emotional core. Because what is common to almost all Netflix’s offerings is a conspicuous lack of emotional intelligence – which is strange for a genre driven almost exclusively by feeling.Nowhere is this more apparent than in Irreplaceable You – a light-hearted romp through a couple’s lives as one of them is slowly killed by cancer. It will still make you cry – a 30-second Tesco advert could do that – but its tone is so spectacularly odd that it feels as if it were made by a confused bot. Too many films have too much in common for it to be totally coincidental, with repetitive ingredients including: a character dramatically quitting their job, a sad interlude about a dead mother and a brief appearance from a past-their-prime Hollywood star.Soon, however, the Netflix romcom doesn’t simply seem ersatz – it also feels strangely infantile, whether or not the film is explicitly aimed at teens. When We First Met follows a group of twentysomethings who behave with the wide-eyed mischief of children half their age. Ibiza casts its lead trio of friends as immature, hot mess-style party animals, while in Christmas Inheritance, about a woman primed to inherit her father’s company, the protagonist shames her family by doing a cartwheel for a dare at a glitzy function.Perhaps Netflix is deliberately catering to younger audiences who have tended to swap traditional TV for streaming – but it may also be playing into a wider trend that has seen the age of romcom protagonists fall across the board, according to Shearer. The financial crisis, too, stymied what was once a key part of the genre: aspirational lifestyle. “All the films before then were really preoccupied with people in very glamorous, grownup jobs, and living in lovely apartments in New York or wherever,” says Shearer. “Part of what the genre is about is experiencing that kind of luxury.” As that luxury has evaporated, so, it seems, has any attempt at sophistication.In many ways, romcoms are perfect for the streaming age. Cheap, easy to produce and mentally undemanding, they require minimal investment from all parties. They also fit neatly with the changing way films are watched – unlike broad comedies or horror, they don’t benefit from the outsized reactions prompted by communal viewing. The phrase “Netflix and chill” may have morphed into a euphemism, but the meme began as a straightforward sentiment – people tend to use the platform while horizontal in the comfort of their home. Romcoms are uniquely suited to people watching from their beds – and films such as the hypnotically gentle To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before seem custom made for the purpose. The romcom is also a genre that has thrived in spite of bad reviews and bad quality. Films widely panned at the tail end of the romcom boom, such as 2009’s The Ugly Truth, went on to earn hundreds of millions at the box office, and Netflix can console itself with the fact that classics such as Bringing Up Baby and When Harry Met Sally attracted a fair amount of derision when they were first released (although if A Christmas Prince ever ends up in the Criterion Collection, it will be a very sad day indeed for cinema). Yet, ultimately, Netflix seems less concerned with winning over users with smart scripts and quality than simply wearing them down – the number of impending releases are already in double figures, with doubtless many more to come. When it comes to romcoms, Netflix is staging a war of attrition: if you’re one of the 80 million who haven’t yet fallen, it’s surely only a matter of time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec410d714deddf3291a21a39563281320a27e83/0_0_3868_2321/master/3868.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=753baf6005e25062572d10d7a387b510","title":"james bond film delayed until 2020 daniel craig danny boyle","story":"Sources close to the production confirm that the next 007 movie will miss its scheduled release date, after disputes between the director, producers and star Daniel Craig It now seems likely that the 25th 007 film won’t be seen cinemas until a year later, as few Bond films have opened in the summer, and the fallout from Boyle’s departure is likely to mean the script he wrote with longtime collaborator John Hodge will be replaced with one by Bond veterans Neil Purvis and Robert Wade.Major logistical reorganisation will be required in order to hit a 2020 release date, given that Purvis and Wade’s script differs in all respects, including plot and characters, from the one by Boyle and Hodge. Speculation has been rife that the “creative differences” behind Boyle’s departure, which was announced by the franchise producers and star Daniel Craig on Monday night, hinge on this script. Some people have suggested that its apparent topicality – referencing the #MeToo movement and potentially Russian involvement in geopolitics – could have proved too hot a potato for Bond head honcho Barbara Broccoli’s palate.Such a theory was backed up by one-time Bond villain Jonathan Pryce, who told the Daily Mail: “They obviously couldn’t take a socialist Bond.” Pryce, who co-starred with Pierce Brosnan in 1999’s Tomorrow Never Dies, continued by suggesting Boyle was a fundamentally bad fit for the position: “There are the Dannys of this world and then there are people who do the blockbusters.”A source told the  that the crunch point was a dispute involving the casting of the villain, with Boyle preferring Cold War star Tomasz Kot, while the producers and Craig felt he would be too left-field a choice. The actor Mark Strong has also been linked to the role.Rumours have also circulated that Craig and Boyle clashed over other casting issues. The former has apparently signed off on all major new signings – including Bond girls – since he began his tenure. If true, this makes the possibility that Craig, 50, will remain in the role, despite Boyle’s exit, more likely. Yet a gap of five years between Bond films is so far unprecedented without a change of lead actor.The tumult triggered by Boyle’s exit is also said to be jeopardising multimillion pound sponsorship contracts, as brands linked to Bond scramble to delay and repurpose massive tie-in advertising campaigns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a6efd36cdbe5cf25bbe5137a93c543f653cfd9e/0_18_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=623f8b8b2e9202561f596a648e5b288d","title":"james bond on film ranked","story":"With the news of Danny Boyle’s departure as director of the next 007 instalment, we rank the big-screen outings of Britain’s finest, from 1962’s Dr No to 2015’s SpectreWrong.

David Niven saunters unsexily as the retired “Sir James Bond” in this chaotic film.Oh lawdy. The Bond franchise was looking lost in the grim and joyless new “war on terror”-era, and this movie featured the worst gadget in the history of 007: an invisible car.

He was supposedly there to give Bond a hard and gritty new seriousness, but always just looked a bit humourless. This was during the Aids era of sexual restraint, too, so Bond only cops off a couple of times.Bond goes rogue, and Dalton stays dull. This one is notable for the young Benicio del Toro as a humble henchman. After this, legal copyright rows caused a six-year production hiatus during which Dalton quit.You can hear a whistling and a crackling in the air as Roger Moore begins to tune out.

In this film, the distinction between villain and henchman seems to collapse with three bad guys: Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane and, erm, Goldie, who was very big in those days.Was it a Bondaissance? A Brosnanaissance? Whatever. Stylish yet assertive smoothie Pierce Brosnan had already made an impression in the TV caper Remington Steele. He took to Bond like a duck to water: virile, cool, nice suits. Judi Dench made her debut as M. Bond was back!Quite unexpectedly, Moore pulled it back a bit for his last hurrah. (It was also, sadly, the last hurrah for Lois Maxwell’s Miss Moneypenny.) Christopher Walken was always destined to play a Bond villain and it came to pass in this film, as the evil electronics mogul Max Zorin. A good note for Moore to bow out on.A whopping, megabudget Bond in its day, clearly influenced by the Star Wars-led sci-fi revival. It is all about the theft of a space shuttle, but this excursion into space can’t conceal the fact that Moore is looking a bit jaded.George Lazenby’s sole appearance wasn’t a bad Bond. Had he done more, Lazenby might have become a favourite. Diana Rigg played the woman who shows 007 is no commitmentphobe. They marry, before gunfire poignantly restores Bond’s eternal singledom.Uh-oh. Connery was tempted back to the role with a big pay packet, now looking craggier and toupeed. Ernst Blofeld, boringly played by Charles Gray, wants to use diamonds to focus his space laser. Bond girl Tiffany Case was played by Jill St John, whose real-life boyfriend, Henry Kissinger, would have been better as the villain.It took a king from Titanic at the box office, but this is a good, underrated Bond: one of the very few films (or plays or books) to satirise Rupert Murdoch and his Chinese expansionist plans – a rather taboo subject in 90s media. Jonathan Pryce has great fun with the role of the villainous mogul.Outrageously daft, but silly and fun. Roger Moore wears a gorilla costume.This has a well-loved Bond song, Carly Simon’s Nobody Does It Better. It also introduced us to the exotic henchman Jaws. The action opens with that staggering skiing-off-a-cliff stunt, just after Moore is seen supposedly skiing in front of an obvious back projection.Despite iffy reviews at the time, this has one of the very best villains, wonderfully played by Christopher Lee: Scaramanga, he of the creepy third nipple. It is a preposterous 70s fuel-crisis drama about a solar energy device. There’s some funky martial arts, too.An excellent, intelligent Bond which shrewdly expanded the role of Judi Dench’s M, developed her relationship with 007 and created a plausible, sympathetic backstory for him. Javier Bardem got his teeth into the villain role.And so began the reign of Roger Moore, tacitly conceding the campness that many saw as unavoidable for Bond. Moore was witty, sprightly and a mature 46 when he took over (Connery had started at 32.) This movie has a great song from Paul McCartney and Wings.The evil organisation Spectre had its first appearance in Fleming’s Thunderball novel, but we were used to it by now, this being the fourth outing for 007 on the big screen. Good stuff here, but the franchise faltered a bit, with long underwater sequences.Boom! Craig and director Sam Mendes bring off an absolutely storming 007 extravaganza, kicking off with a head-banging action sequence in Mexico City. Léa Seydoux has a Veronica Lake-type sultriness and Ben Whishaw almost steals the show as the geeky Q.Daniel Craig had to face a lot of internet bickering when he was cast, but he blew everyone away with a performance that was just right: cool, cruel, ruthless, yet sardonic. It was great at the time and looks even better now. One of the best Bonds.Sean Connery’s first outing in the Bond role. It gave us the gun-barrel titles and the Monty Norman theme. There was Ursula Andress in the bikini and the exotic Johnny Foreigner villain with an outrageous island lair.Weirdly ungadgety and downbeat. Connery searches his hotel room for bugs for what seems like 10 minutes, with the theme music playing deafeningly. There’s a great train fight with Robert Shaw’s Red Grant.“You eckshpect me to talk?” “No, Mr Bond, I expect you to DIE!” This introduced us to Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 and the weird spectacle of Shirley Eaton suffocating in gold. It established the convention whereby the villain leaves 007 time to escape some elaborate automated death.This great action movie put Connery’s Bond right back on top and introduced us to the Nehru-suit-wearing, cat-stroking master criminal Spectre chief, Blofeld, played by Donald Pleasence. Connery announced his intention to quit after this. Perhaps he knew it could never be this good again?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5409a5d1b8bcb13c30faa581cf098f0a4c2bc4ff/145_212_4627_2775/master/4627.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=901a661a2521867a7ad8dcc3d166f92f","title":"unbroken path to redemption unofficial movie sequels","story":"With the release of Unbroken: Path to Redemption an odd history of unsanctioned sequels, from Never Say Never Again to Titanic II emergesNext month will see the release of Unbroken: Path to Redemption, the follow-up to Angelina Jolie’s 2014 biopic of Olympian-turned-PoW Louis Zamperini. Considering how successful the first Unbroken proved (it grossed $163m off a budget of $65m, with the third largest Christmas Day opening ever) you might be wondering why this sequel isn’t getting more attention. The answer is simple: it isn’t an official sequel. Aside from producer Matt Baer, none of the original cast or crew are returning for the new film, and Pure Flix, the faith-based distribution company behind the film’s release, hopes that brand recognition alone will be enough to draw audiences.Iffy as such a marketing campaign may sound, Unbroken: Path to Redemption actually fits into a long tradition of unofficial sequels – films attempting to capitalize on popular properties despite having no actual connection. It’s a bizarre subgenre mostly filled with cheap knockoffs, ignored or forgotten by all but diehard completists and tapeheads. However, within this cinematic outland, there are more than a few diamonds in the rough. Here are some of the more notable entries in the canon of motion-picture apocrypha:The only two James Bond films not made by Eon Productions, each of these entries, though adapted from Ian Fleming novels and featuring the iconic secret agent front-and-center (portrayed by David Niven and Sean Connery, respectively), are generally considered to stand outside the series’ established continuity. That’s an easy enough designation when it comes to Casino Royale, as it is as much a spoof as it is spy thriller, but Connery’s return to the role after a 12-year absence is harder to dismiss, especially since what it all boils down to is petty squabbling between rights holders. Thanks to loose copyright laws, Italy is the greatest source of unofficial sequels. Italian producers have long exploited this system, generating countless knockoffs of American movies – especially American horror movies – oftentimes attempting to pass them off as legitimate sequels. While most of these movies turn out about as shabby as you’d expect, one particular example stands out from the rest: Zombie 2, Lucio Fulci’s provisional sequel to George Romero’s Dawn of Dead (reedited by legendary horror maestro Dario Argento for Italian audiences, and retitled Zombi 2).The film attempts to tie itself to Romero’s original film with two quick bookends, but otherwise it’s all Fucli’s show, a grand guignol maelstrom, overflowing with visual and sonic flourishes, faint-worthy bodily carnage and a suffocating air of cosmic dread. As if that weren’t enough of an endorsement, there’s a scene where a zombie fights a shark underwater. Twenty-three years before Peter Jackson brought his epic Lord of the Rings trilogy to a close (or so we all thought), smashing box office and Academy Awards records alike, there was this television production from animation studio RankinBass. A very truncated version of JRR Tolkien’s concluding novel, the movie is a continual source of confusion: while many viewers assumed it to be a direct continuation of Ralph Bakshi’s roto-scoped adaptation of the Lord of the Rings two years prior, it was actually meant to serve as the follow up to the beloved 1977 animated version of The Hobbit. Out of the three, The Return of the King is the least memorable, but at least it afforded Tolkien nerds some measure of closure at a time when the notion of any legitimate adaptation seemed utterly impossible.  Returning to horror, Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is opposite from most unofficial sequels – while it’s technically part of the larger franchise, it has zero connection to the other films beyond its tacked-on subtitle. Conceived and produced as an entirely original film, The Haunting of Hamilton High was renamed in order to capitalize on the success of the first Prom Night.Unlike its by-the-numbers predecessor, Hello Mary Lou is a legitimately compelling movie, a tightly constructed supernatural thriller with a handful of clever set pieces and bursts of startling artistry. Mostly forgotten since its release, the film has received critical reappraisal over the last couple years, giving it a reputation as The Godfather 2 of 1980s slasher flicks. Often held up as the best worst movie, Troll 2 is another Italian production, although in the case of this eco-minded horror oddity, it was American distributors who attempted to connect it to the moderately successful Troll of four years earlier. Originally known as Goblin (no trolls appear in the film, nor are they ever referenced), the complete disconnect between title and content is but one of many baffling qualities that elevated the film to cult status, earning it a place alongside other tried-and-true – some might say “tired” – classics of the “so-bad-it’s-good variety”, such as The Room and Plan 9 from Outer Space.Asylum Studios’ entire modus operandi is to produce bald-faced knock-offs of recent andor upcoming blockbusters as fast as possible, for as little money as possible (some of their titles include Transmorphers and AVH: Alien v Hunter), so it should come as no surprise that they’d just outright call their Titanic rip off Titanic II.A new luxury cruise liner, christened, obviously, Titanic II, sets sail along the same path as the first, only to be met with catastrophe when a massive tsunami sends a giant iceberg hurtling … well, you get the gist. What follows is a by-the-numbers rip off of James Cameron’s mega-melodrama, with less than half the run time and action entirely supplanting the romance. Viewers who consider the Birdemic movies high entertainment might get some ironic pleasure from this but others should probably avoidPart spoof, part remake, part experimental film, this unsanctioned sequel to Paul Verhoeven’s misunderstood trash classic – from writerdirectorproducerstar Rena Riffel, who reprises her small role from the original – is unique among other unsanctioned sequels, as it doesn’t attempt to exploit its namesake’s brand recognition so much as engage it in meta-textual dialogue. In this regard, it’s closer to something like Gus Van Sant’s misbegotten shot-for-shot remake of Psycho than anything else on this list. Considering how insane Showgirls is to begin with, such an effort makes for a fitting tribute, but needless to say, this one is for diehard enthusiasts only.Even compared to the exploitative nature of most other examples on this list, the story surrounding Easy Rider: The Ride Back leaves a particularly bad taste in the mouth. Written, produced and starring former Ohio lawyer-turned-producer Phil Pitzer, who upon discovering that the rights to any Easy Rider remakesequel were available successfully sued original producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for them, the film serves as both a sequel and a prequel to Dennis Hopper’s seminal New Hollywood classic.The film revolves around the family of Wyatt Williams, AKA Captain America (played by Peter Fonda in the original Easy Rider) tracing their troubled relationship over the years. (Pitzer, who bears a slight resemblance to Fonda, casts himself as one of the Williams brothers.) As obsessed with the counterculture staple as Pitzer clearly is, he doesn’t seem to respect it’s political ethos, supplanting the original’s jaundiced look at America with a heavy pro-military message, replete with out-of-nowhere references to 911. For as repugnant as that may sound, it follows a certain kind of baby-boomer logic: Pitzer’s unauthorized sequel isn’t so much a vanity project as it is a full-blown midlife crisis caught on film.Produced in 2012, but not released until 2016, Raging Bull 2 – which covers the hardscrabble life of boxer Jake LaMotta, picking up where the last film left off, while also going further back in time to examine his early years – was forced to disassociate itself from Martin Scorsese and a Robert DeNiro’s 1980 masterpiece after being hit with a lawsuit from MGM.LaMotta had sold his life rights to the studio in 1976, and while he retained the right to pursue a sequel, MGM reserved the right of refusal, which they swiftly enforced in this case. That didn’t stop the aged prizefighter (90 at the time, he has since passed) and producers from brazenly calling their picture Raging Bull 2 and billing it as a legitimate sequel. The legal battle that ensued lasted about as long as one of LaMotta’s later fights, with he and producers quickly ceding to MGM’s demands. The film was retitled The Bronx Bull, after another of LaMotta’s in-ring nickname and released a few years later (with William Forster “taking over” for DeNiro) to little fanfare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca8eaa87648c2cab5430f2a7a5fe6a258bc1af3f/0_153_8510_5107/master/8510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce3516ce1430e3d94f98bff799e40b0e","title":"anna jones sweetcorn recipes","story":"As cobs come into season, enjoy the kernels charred with pickled chilli and herbs, or blend them into a velvety soupI overdosed on sweetcorn as a kid. Fresh corn was a rarity, though more often it was frozen half-cobs or Green Giant eaten from the tin. Like many markers of my childhood and teenage years, from wearing the petrol blue of my school uniform to drinking Malibu and Coke, I turned my back on sweetcorn. For years I couldn’t see its culinary merit, but I was missing out. Every year late in the summer, when papery wrapped cobs are four for £1, I make up for it. Corn comes at a time that’s half summer, half autumn, and these recipes bridge those seasons.In a chowder, corn is usually paired with potatoes to add creaminess and body. I use cauliflower here instead: it suits the season, as this soup is a little lighter than the potato version. It also makes use of the often wasted cauliflower leaves, which I crisp up in a pan as I would crispy kale. The basil, spring onion, green chilli and peanut topping is what makes it sing. You could use other nuts, and coriander would work in place of basil, if you like.Olive oil1 leek, trimmed and finely slicedSalt and black pepper4 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced1 pinch dried red chilli350g cauliflower (about ½ a medium one), cut into small florets, leaves shredded3 corn on the cob, kernels sliced off the husk (about 650g kernels)1 x 400ml can coconut milk1 tsp veg stock powder or ½ a cube Juice of ½ lemonHeat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large soup pan over a medium-high heat. Add the leeks and a good pinch of salt and cook for 10 minutes, until soft and sweet.Add the garlic and dried chilli, cook for two minutes, then add the cauliflower florets, keeping the leaves for later. Add all but a handful of the corn, a good pinch of salt, the coconut milk, stock cube and one and a half tins of water, then bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 minutes. It’s ready when the cauliflower is soft throughout and the soup has thickened a little. Blend with a hand blender until it’s about half liquidised. Add a little lemon juice and a good grind of black pepper. Taste, adding more salt, pepper and lemon as needed.Heat a frying pan over a medium heat, add a little oil and then the remaining corn, the chopped chilli and spring onions, along with the shredded cauliflower leaves. Cook until the corn is charred and the leaves wilted to a deeper green. Serve on top of the soup with the herbs torn over and a scattering of peanuts.I use one of my new favourite ingredients here: pickled chillies, which add an instant pop of heat, acidity and sweetness: a great foil for the smoky corn. I buy the jarred spicy Pepperdew ones from the supermarket, or make them myself. To make your own, heat 100ml white-wine vinegar with a tablespoon of sugar until dissolved and add four sliced chillies. Leave to pickle in the liquid for at least an hour. 2 small shallots, peeled and finely slicedJuice of 2 limesSalt Extra-virgin olive oil4 corn on the cob, kernels sliced off the husk (about 800g kernels)4 pickled red chillies (shop bought, or make your own – see introduction to recipe)4 tbsp Greek yoghurt (optional)1 large bunch coriander leavesA good grating of parmesan cheese (I use a vegetarian one, optional)Put the shallots into a small bowl, squeeze over the lime juice, add a pinch of salt and scrunch a few times with your hands.Heat about one tablespoon of oil in your largest frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the corn kernels and a good pinch of salt then cook, undisturbed, until well charred underneath – this will take about three minutes. Toss and cook again until the corn is charred all over – another three or four minutes.Once the shallots have sat for a little while, add the pickled chillies, three tablespoons of olive oil and the yoghurt, if using. Season and mix.Put the charred corn in a large bowl with half the coriander, pour over the dressing and toss together, adding more salt if needed.

I’ll pluck one off my shelves occasionally. There are a few proper reference tomes, though, that I do go back to: Roger Phillips’ books – Mushrooms and Wild Food are two. Another is Anna Del Conte’s Gastronomy of Italy.I’ve always been a fan of Anna’s. and she’s always been a fan of mine. We’ll still sometimes meet for lunch or dinner. We once went to Italy together, about 25 years ago, to do a talk – I don’t remember exactly what the talk was about, but I remember having the best ricotta I’d ever tasted, all freshly made. And I remember tasting farinata for the first time. Anna is a motherly figure. It was great to be with her.I got my first copy of Gastronomy of Italy about 20 years ago I think I found it secondhand, flicked through it quickly and bought it. I’ve since bought another. Anna’s writing is excellent, classic Italian cuisine, accurate and authentic. This book in particular is so good – both on ingredients and dishes. Anna’s writing really encapsulates the Italian approach. Anyone who reads her – whether an amateur cook or a restaurateur – would find that. She’s an authority. I will often refer to her when I’m writing, to double-check what I’m doing is authentic.Italian food influences all sorts of people, mostly because it’s so simple and all about the ingredients, which is what good-quality British food is about, too. Of course, depending on what your definition of British food is, you might disagree, but – for me, there are definite parallels between the two traditions: the braises, the simple cuts, the grilled meats on the bone. Take the classic bifsteak Fiorentina, the simple approach to fish, and to vegetables and salads – all these Italian stalwarts find an echo in what we make in the UK.Italian food, contrary to Thai food, say, or Vietnamese, doesn’t need adjusting to British ingredients, since most things Italian recipes call for are readily available in the UK. The caponata recipe from Gastronomy of Italy always stood out for me, because Anna adds strong grated chocolate to the regular ingredients – the aubergine, vinegar, capers, etc – to give it that balance of sweet and sourness.A Sicilian dish that appears in many different versions throughout the island. It is a mixture of fried aubergine, celery, onion and tomato, to which artichokes or wild asparagus may be added. It is sometimes garnished with small octopus, prawns or shrimps, small pieces of lobster or bottarga (dried mullet or tuna roe). For an even richer caponata, a special sauce, called salsa di San Bernardo, is poured over it. This is made with sugar, vinegar, toasted almonds and dark chocolate: a sweet-and-sour sauce very much in the medieval style.Heat 2.5cm vegetable oil in a frying pan. When the oil is hot, add a layer of aubergines and fry until golden brown on all sides. Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkling each batch lightly with salt. Repeat until all the aubergines are cooked. Fry the celery in the same oil, until golden and crisp. Drain on kitchen paper.Pour the olive oil into a clean frying pan and add the onion. Saute gently for about 10 minutes, until soft. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring frequently, over a moderate heat for about 15 minutes, then season to taste.Meanwhile, heat the sugar and vinegar in a small saucepan. Add the chocolate, capers and olives, and simmer gently until the chocolate has melted. Add to the tomato sauce and cook for a further five minutes.Mix the aubergines and celery into the tomato sauce. Stir and cook for 20 minutes, so the flavours blend. Pour the caponata into a serving dish and leave to cool.Before serving, pass the eggs through the smallest holes of a food mill or push through a metal sieve over the caponata."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8016f11d4e1b5c7e727636611ccb9908c119f4d5/0_54_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=816899ba138c5ea7f71b76c630211941","title":"liverpool fsg insist club not for sale open to investment","story":"• Cousin of Manchester City owner thought to have made offer• Fenway Sports Group ‘clear and consistent: club is not for sale’Liverpool’s owner, Fenway Sports Group, is still open to new outside investment but remains steadfast in its stance that the club is not for sale.Details have emerged of a proposed £2bn takeover bid from Abu Dhabi-based Sheik Khaled Bin Zayed al-Nehayan, the cousin of the Manchester City owner, Sheik Mansour, as reported by the Daily Mail.However, Press Association Sport understands that interest – one of a number of approaches FSG has received in recent years – did not get past the vetting stage because it was deemed neither credible nor worthy of being put to the ownership.“FSG have been clear and consistent: the club is not for sale,” said a Liverpool statement. “But what the ownership has said, again clearly and consistently, is that under the right terms and conditions we would consider taking on a minority investor, if such a partnership was to further our commercial interests in specific market places and in line with the continued development and growth of the club and the team.”FSG uses the services of the New York-based investment bank Allen \u0026amp Company to vet and filter any interest it receives and this approach was no different. However, it became apparent the interest was not viable as proof of funds were not forthcoming, meaning the approach never got past the discussion stage with the bank and the proposals were not put forward to FSG’s principal owner, John Henry, and other key figures such as Tom Werner, Liverpool’s chairman, and FSG’s president, Mike Gordon.FSG has invested significantly in the club since its £300m purchase of the club in October 2010, with the £115m redevelopment of Anfield’s Main Stand, a £50m commitment to build a new training ground, securing Jürgen Klopp on a six-year contract in 2016 and this summer alone spending £170m on transfers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d93fe54baf6821e99bd0215ecec9cd68173375c0/14_39_2534_1520/master/2534.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5051b6ad3371e4c97eb7b7363386bccb","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Jack Wilshere returns to Arsenal, Spurs can compound José Mourinho’s misery and Newcastle fans’ philanthropic T-shirtsWolves have attacked with panache in their first two Premier League games but have also looked vulnerable at the back and conceded two goals in each. In an effort to tighten up his team, Nuno Espírito Santo must be tempted to give a first start in defence to the new signing Leander Dendoncker, although he might decide that throwing in the Belgian against City is too fiery a baptism. Besides, Ryan Bennett, the man most likely to be replaced by Dendoncker, played well when these teams met in the League Cup last season, when Wolves became the first side to keep a clean sheet against the supposedly unstoppable City. So Wolves know it can be done. But if we’re going to dredge up history, then Pep Guardiola could point out to his players that Wolves have been spectacularly ruthless against City in the past (racking up wins of 8-0, 8-1 and 7-2 a very, very long time ago) and City have never properly avenged those thrashings. PDTwo games, two wins, six goals scored and none conceded. It has been a superb start to the season for Liverpool and it is hard to see how Brighton can do anything to stop the red juggernaut in its tracks. Ahead of their trip to Anfield, Chris Hughton and his players can at least take some hope from the performance of Jürgen Klopp’s front three at Crystal Palace on Monday. There was a distinct lack of fluidity between Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah and while they all played a part in the 2-0 victory, they were not at their best, inidually or collectively. All three will no doubt improve as the season goes on but Klopp may use Saturday’s game as an early opportunity to mix things up in attack by giving Daniel Sturridge or Xherdan Shaqiri a start, or using Firmino in a deeper role. With plenty of games to come this season, it may be a wise move for the Liverpool manager to keep opponents on their toes, as well as plan for those moments when his main men in attack are injured, suspended or off their game. SNTwo new managers, same old problems. Both Unai Emery and Manuel Pellegrini have yet to make headway towards solving woes that are deeply ingrained at their respective clubs. And both have seemed a trifle naïve in their early attempts to address them, providing scant protection to flimsy defences. In that sense, these teams are ideal opponents for each other and, this weekend, one of them could get away with leaving themselves dangerously open – most likely Arsenal, unless Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang misfires as badly as he did against Chelsea. But there is a wild card in the form of a returning Jack Wilshere, who is unlikely to have a quiet game on his return to the Emirates Stadium. PD“Do you really need an explanation of what this T-shirt is about?” enquires Newcastle fan website and fanzine True Faith in the advert for their “Ashley Out” T-shirts which, at the time of writing, have already sold out in XL (behave). Not any more, is the obvious answer and considering the sentiment involved coupled with True Faith’s donation of a quid from every £5 purchase going to the Newcastle United Fans Food Bank, few local causes seem more worthy. Expect to see plenty of these stylish garments on show when Chelsea and the Sky cameras pitch up at St James’ Park for a high-profile date on Sunday afternoon. The brisk sales suggest that even those Newcastle fans who consider wearing anything warmer than a large tattoo on their torsos to be a sign of weakness are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to get the message across. BGOn Saturday afternoon, Everton return to the scene of a crime – a crime against football, if you’ll allow the Alan Partridge quotation. The Merseysiders’ last visit to the Vitality Stadium, in December, saw them lose 2-1 against a Bournemouth side who had to failed to win any of their previous eight games. Everton should have dominated proceedings but instead they were insipid and lost, with Sam Allardyce’s negative tactics seen by many as the root cause. Certainly, his decision to play with three holding midfielders was misguided and set the tone for his brief, unhappy time at the club. Now Marco Silva is in charge and a new energy about Everton, and the expectation is they will take the game to Bournemouth. That could be a risk given Eddie Howe’s side’s excellent start to the season and decent record on home soil, so Silva may well be minded to play things safe. Sit back, defend, deploy three holding midfielders. That feels unlikely, however, and should the Portuguese go for broke and Everton win it could feel as if the club has turned a corner. SNAfter Harry Maguire pitched up at Old Trafford for Manchester United’s first home match of the season, their second sees a visit from Toby Alderweireld. It appears even the fixture computer is taunting poor old José Mourinho these days. Oh well, the Portuguese is just going to have to learn to put a brave face on things – like Mauricio Pochettino does – and carry on entrusting the centre of his defence to Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelöf, a pair for whom he did, after all, approve an expenditure of more than £60m. When Bailly first arrived he looked exactly like the dependable stopper around whom Mourinho could build his defence but the Ivorian has regressed alarmingly since then, perhaps debilitated by the chaos around him both on and off the pitch. Too many people at United seem to be pulling in different directions. If they do not pull themselves together pronto, they could be on the end of a humiliating lesson from Spurs. PDLeicester City have at times looked worryingly ramshackle in defence in their opening two matches. Despite keeping a clean sheet in victory against Wolves, their opponents roared out of the traps and could conceivably have put the game to bed before Claude Puel’s side scored against the run of play. Against Manchester United, Daniel Amartey was a surprise inclusion at right-back, gave away a daft early penalty and was subsequently dropped in favour of Ricardo Pereira. Of the four defenders who lined up against United, only Harry Maguire and Ben Chilwell kept their places, with Wes Morgan demoted to the bench so another new signing, Jonny Evans could make his Leicester debut. Maguire is a first-team staple, while Chilwell has played well enough at left-back to suggest his position is not under threat from Christian Fuchs. Having managed Ricardo at Nice and paid £17.5m to Porto for his services, Puel clearly holds the Portuguese defender in high regard and he looks destined to be first choice. Morgan may also have to grow accustomed to life as a back-up. The availability of what looks a decent first-choice defence should enable Puel to further allay fears surrounding his future with the club. BGHuddersfield’s last game in the regular season of the Championship, a little over a year ago, was a 3-0 home defeat against Neil Warnock’s Cardiff. David Wagner’s side were in leisure mode that day because they were saving themselves for the imminent play-off semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday. This, by contrast, will be a proper battle and, after sinking to the bottom of the table through predictable defeats against Chelsea and Manchester City, Huddersfield need to get their season going. Although it will be far from easy, this might be Huddersfield’s best chance in the whole campaign of getting a win. Cardiff probably have similar thoughts, at least in terms of away assignments. It is clear how Warnock will approach the game. The most positive stance for Wagner would be to revert to a back four and start with wingers on each side – perhaps the new signings Adama Diakhaby and Isaac Mbenza. PDFulham entertain Burnley in the Premier League for the first time in eight years, with both sides still looking for their first win of the season. The Cottagers have lost their two opening games against Crystal Palace and Tottenham, but can take plenty of positives from both games. The club’s record signing Jean Michaël Seri spoke this week about how Fulham’s dozen summer signings are finding their feet. “I think we are seeing that the team is starting to familiarise themselves with each other,” he said. “We are going to get better, we are going to get stronger, because it’s clear to see the quality in this group of players.” With just three new acquisitions to bed in, Burnley’s Europa League adventures mean they have five more matches under their belts. Sean Dyche said recently that Burnley “are trying to evolve into a side that can hurt teams in many different ways”, but their habit of ceding possession could cost them against a team managed by a man who is never happier than when his players have the ball at their feet high up the field. Sunday’s match should offer some interesting pointers to what lies ahead for both teams. BGThere was a moment during Crystal Palace’s defeat against Liverpool on Monday when it felt almost impossible not to pity Christian Benteke. Having freed himself from the attentions of the imperious Virgil van Dijk, the striker lined up a shot from just outside of the area. It was 1-0 to Liverpool at the time and this felt like Palace’s chance to get back into the game. Benteke pulled back his foot, fired and sent the ball ballooning so high and wide you feared for the safety of passers-by outside Selhurst Park. The Belgian’s decline has been startling, from one of the most deadly strikers in the Premier League to a figure of tragicomic proportions. It is now reaching a stage where Roy Hodgson has a decision to make over a player who cost £27m to sign, from Liverpool, in 2016 and last season scored only three goals in 31 appearances. Hodgson is likely to hand Benteke a third successive start of the season at Watford on Sunday but, should the 27-year-old fail to score and be substituted for a third successive time, it may be time for him to be taken out of action altogether.

Sergio Agüero scored twice but post-match discussion centred largely on whether he had a future at the club. Pep Guardiola had made it clear he felt there were elements of the Argentinian’s game that did not fit with his vision and had brought in Gabriel Jesus with a view, it seemed, to easing him out.That evening Guardiola’s mood was irritable, as it tends to be when he is forced into evasion. He had, he said, answered the question of Agüero’s future “10 times” more accurately, he had been asked the same question 10 times. “The media knows my opinion,” he added. By that point, his squirming meant everybody did and perhaps, had Jesus not suffered a knee injury that let Agüero back into the side, the Argentinian would have left.Almost 18 months later, City again hammered Huddersfield at home. This time it was in the league, City racked up six goals, and Agüero got three of them. But the biggest change was in Guardiola. “With the ball and without the ball,” the manager said, “he is sharp and intelligent and, of course, his talent to score goals is always there. The pass was so good but the finishing is outstanding.”The finishing has always been outstanding. Agüero has scored 204 goals in 295 appearances for City in all competitions, including 146 in 208 Premier League games, five times getting more than 20 in a season. He has surpassed Eric Brook as City’s all-time leading scorer. Only nine players have scored more Premier League goals than him (none at a higher ratio of goals per game) and Les Ferdinand (149) and Michael Owen (150) could be surpassed in a couple of weeks. Another 18 goals would take him past Jermain Defoe and Robbie Fowler to sixth in the list. Another 30 and he surpasses Thierry Henry as the player to have scored most Premier League goals for a single club.That is a remarkable level of consistency but it’s not just Guardiola who has been unsure of him. Not only has Agüero never been named footballer of the year by either the Professional Footballers’ Association or the Football Writers’ Association, but last season was also the first in which he was named in the PFA team of the year.Perhaps there has been a more general scepticism about his all-round contribution, or perhaps, for all his ability, he is simply not starry enough off the pitch to thrust himself into the consciousness.After all, in seven years at City, he seems to have lived an almost monastic life. There is little sense of him embracing Manchester and his English remains rudimentary, while the Amazon documentary All or Nothing gave the impression his flat is devoid of natural light. His son, who lives in Argentina with Agüero’s former wife, the daughter of Diego Maradona, visits one week every month, but apart from that it’s not clear exactly what he does, other than training and scoring goals.Other than his City and Argentina teammate Nicolás Otamendi, the player he seems to get on best with is David de Gea, whom he knows from their time together at Atlético Madrid. That is not to suggest, though, any lack of affection for City. In previous seasons when he has had protracted spells out with injury, it was common to see him in the tunnel, anxiously following games with an engagement few players seem to share.Agüero acknowledged he had to change his game if he was to succeed at City under Guardiola. “Pep is a very demanding coach and adapting to what he wanted was not easy during the first year,” he told the Argentinian channel TyC at the end of last season, admitting he had made his manager “angry”.“As well as my responsibilities as a striker, he wanted to get me involved as the first defender of the team … I think this season we were on the same page with Pep. He told me he was happy with my performance and his\u0026nbspanger was worth it because I had a better year.”There is no reason why a player of Agüero’s type cannot succeed in a Guardiola side. After all, the last of the four successive league titles Guardiola won as part of Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona was won with Romário up front and so closely did Agüero resemble the Brazilian when he first emerged at Independiente he was given the same nickname – “Chapulín” (Grasshopper).If Guardiola persists with the 3‑1‑4-2 deployed against Huddersfield, Agüero and Jesus will presumably continue to be partnered. But the change in Agüero means that when the system features a single striker, he would seem to have the edge over Jesus.Agüero may never get close to Romário’s remarkable tallies of goals (depending exactly what is included totals range from around 600 to more than 1,000) but, at only 30, so long as he keeps defending, there is plenty of time for him to keep climbing the Premier League goal rankings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ac4c11f7a70a669191824f3c59838ec5d3e065/0_127_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35fba56f45c30f31d44a0e5a1730066f","title":"tata martino atlanta united mls argentina barcelona","story":"The Atlanta United coach has managed Argentina and Lionel Messi’s Barcelona. But he has relished the opportunity of a blank canvas in MLSGerardo “Tata” Martino started playing for his local club, Newell’s Old Boys, in the city of Rosario, as a child. He made his debut in the first ision aged 17, and went on to win three titles as a player. Legend says an eight-year-old Lionel Messi pleased the crowds with keepy-uppies during Martino’s send-off. He returned as manager and his club were champions again in 2013 and Martino’s contribution to the club’s history is now etched forever in the stand named after him. Becoming a champion as a player and manager, is, he says, “the most beautiful thing with my club. Not only that but I live 10 blocks from the stadium.”So, what took a man who had managed Argentina and Lionel Messi’s Barcelona to Atlanta United, a new club playing in the relative obscurity of MLS? “It was an opportunity to start the story from the beginning,” says Martino, who felt the blank canvas of creating a team from scratch wasn’t a million miles from his experience as a national manager. “You have the possibility of choosing who you want, because you have no one. Here it was the same. There was nothing. So ... we built up gradually, calling up the players.”On the subject of the World Cup, Martino says problems off the pitch may have been to blame for Argentina’s disappointing campaign. “A lot was said and I don’t know how much was true, but some things really surprised me,” he says. “I was involved in Argentina at a time of much convulsion within the AFA ... but I’ve never seen anything like the internal convulsion that seemed to take place at this World Cup. In this case there was an adverse impact on the sporting side”Meanwhile, in MLS, Martino’s expertise in the Latin American market, coupled with Atlanta’s directors’ knowledge of North American players, has been a good formula. “We complement each other well,” Martino says. “We make a good duet.” He names club owner Arthur Blank, president Darren Eales, and technical director Carlos Bocanegra as the architects of this idea.Canadian teenager Alphonso Davies’s recent transfer from MLS to Bayern Munich attracted plenty of attention. Does it prove the league can help develop young North American stars? “I think this is becoming a place a bit like maybe the Portuguese or Dutch leagues are in Europe a place where young players can make the leap to the European top flight. I think there is a will to turn it into a league of young players, and that is one of the things that most attracted me to this project. There are very good young American players, and there are also very good and very young Latin American players. And also clubs that go for the big names that have had a great career in Europe. But we have a young squad our players are not older than 25. And I like that. I like accompanying the development of young players.”He gives the example of US Under-18 midfielder Andrew Carleton, who is still mostly a bench player but is very close to the first team: “He is currently Atlanta United’s best project and there are many players his age in other teams. Davies is a case in point, sold to Bayern for a lot of money. Tyler Adams, from Red Bulls, could be another – most probably the same will happen with him.” Adapting to life in the US hasn’t been a struggle for Martino. “A lot of it has to do with personal tastes it’s a country I’ve always liked. An opportunity to live a once-in-a-lifetime experience in a country I like … And also I was influenced by many years working in places of very high public exposure. This was a chance to get away from that a little bit.” He mentions “everything Barcelona or Argentina mean in terms of media,” and says there is something very refreshing in the US, where “the eyes of the nation turn to other sports such as baseball or basketball. He finds it “much easier to ... concentrate on what I like and know, which is training my team. In my other jobs I wasted a lot of time on things which shouldn’t have taken up so much time.”I mention that’s a very Marcelo Bielsa thing to say, and he laughs, aware that comparisons with the other Newell’s legend follow him around. But the comparison also makes him uneasy, saying on the one hand he feels the comparison is “ine” and that when the press say someone is “like Bielsa” one literally gets offered work. On the other, he says, the media are forever making pronouncements and then asking him to justify them. The same argument applies to his career, in a way. He has managed Barcelona (“a treat”) and Newell’s (“a double treat”) he relished his five years in Paraguay at national level, and enjoyed managing Argentina. “Why do I have to give explanations of why I’m here? I wanted to be here. And it’s been a boom!”Martino sees his role as leading the team that accompanies the boom – the people, the stadium (which he says is the best in the world) – with a footballing concept that works well. Born into a club, in a city, in a country where football is intrinsic to identity, history and tradition, he is now conquering the new, in every sense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a106f6a9d929064e54b8c8d8a8e5e6ef4faad49/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e524b6db6e4c97b1396222e339be11a5","title":"mourinho vs the world and a book writers special football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Michael Calvin to discuss Liverpool’s perfect start, José Mourinho’s issues with everyone, books, plane banner protests and the joy of chancing across a game in the parkRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

And, courtesy of transcriber extraordinaire Dominic Fifield, here are his words. I like the line about the party and the war:“I don’t know. I think that Eden is ready for 50-60 minutes. I don’t know for 90 minutes. But he can start.”Wants to start, though, doesn’t he?“Maybe. But I think it’s more important, my mind.”He’s happy with that situation?“I am happy with him. He wants to play. I think it’s the right way to think for him. But I have to think for everybody.”Definitely staying at Chelsea?“I think so. I am the coach of a very good team. I am the coach of a very great club. And so I think that such an important club cannot sell a very important player without the possibility of buying another very important player at the same level. So I think that Eden will stay with us for all the season.”“It was only a decision about the positions. I chose to put on the bench two wingers and only one midfielder. I have spoken with him twice this week, after I spoke with the club. So I think that Loftus will remain with us. We can speak again about his situation, but I think only in December.”“I think that, for nutrition, we have a very important doctor and I think he is better than me for this decision. I think.”But you want to keep the players happy... any more changes to be done?“For me, it’s very important... I like it very much when the team are able to work very well during the training. When the team is trying to improve. When the team is able to work on mistakes. They are professional. So, off the pitch, they are able to eat in the right way, rest in the right way. I don’t want to impose anything (on them).”Working on the defending?“Every week. I am not worried about the defensive phase because, when I arrive at a new team, usually I have problems with the defensive phase for two or three months. So I think it’s normal for me.”Ever switch to a five?“No, I am not able to play with five defenders, because we are trying to defend by looking only at the ball. In this way, if I defend with five defenders, I lose immediately metres on the pitch. I am not able. I tried five years ago, but it’s not my way.”“I think that, in this moment, for a defender it’s more difficult to play in my team after only 20 days of training. It’s easier for an offensive player. For a defender it’s more difficult. So I think that, at this moment, he needs to have a lot more defensive training with us.”Spoken to him about that?“Yes, but I told him that needs to be patient now. But that he is very important for us.”“No. In Italy, it’s a war before the match. But during the match I think that, in Serie A, after 20 minutes 2-0, the match is finished. Here, it’s a party before the match but a war during the match. I prefer here.”“First of all, I think I have to say thank you to Rafa because, when I arrived in Naples, I had immediately the feeling that the team was almost ready to play my football. And if I arrived after another coach, maybe for me it would have been more difficult. So I have to say thank you to him. I know he’s a very good coach. We know that, on Sunday, it will be very difficult for us. We know that these opponents are very dangerous for us. In the last season, Chelsea lost 3-0 I think at Newcastle. Manchester United lost there too. Arsenal lost there as well. So we know everything. We know it will be a very difficult day for us on Sunday.”“I think Mateo and Eden played very well in the last 30 minutes, but I think also that, in that moment, the intensity of the match was going down. But I think, like Eden, Mateo is ready to play for 60 or 65 minutes.”Wish you could have signed him permanently?“I think, now, it’s too early to say yet. I like him very much, so I hope that he will remain here in the future.”Confident you have the players defensively to play the style you want?“In life, I’m not sure about everything. But I think that I have my opinion. My feeling is that, in this team, I have very intelligent players. So they can improve in one month, I think. I think they will be able to do it very well in one or two months. No more.”In more team news, first of all, Huddersfield have a clean bill of health to face Cardiff! And David Wagner has rubbished the insane suggestion that it’s win or bust. Straw men being swatted away everywhere today!It is not like this. If you win a cup final you have a trophy, if you lose a cup final everything is over. It is an important game, because it is the next one. We are focused on us and our work to do everything as good as we can. Then we want to bring this energy and intensity into the John Smiths Stadium.”How very rude, Nick, I ate it delicately and decorously. Although, I believe, in certain cultures it’s de rigueur to slurp your meal as loudly as possible to denote maximum enjoyment.Anyway, we’re at something approaching Peak Press Conference Time so there should be various managerial pearls coming your way very soon.And with that, Nick Ames looks like he’s finished scoffing and quaffing his lunch, so it’s back to him. Take care of him for the rest of the day. They will need some belief. The last time Spurs scored at Old Trafford in the league was in 2014: they’ve lost their last four games there without finding the net. Match preview time. Here’s the skinny on Arsenal v West Ham. Who’s going to play? The answers lie within. You may have noticed that Mario Balotelli has decided to stay at Nice, despite interest from Marseille, and indeed China. And here he is, speaking about it:I had the intention to leave and the club knew it. I understand the fans but they need to understand my side. Nice are not playing in Europe, Marseille are playing in Europe. It’s nothing to do with the supporters, I look at what is best, in the end I stay here.It is my choice because nobody tells me what to do. I do what I feel and what I want... the final decision in my career is always mine. I can have people who give me advice but the final decision is always mine.I had a big offer of money from China but not for now... I want to play the Euro 2020 for the national team and if I go to China that would be difficult.He also said that new Nice manager Patrick Vieira changed “80 per cent” of his decision. Thanks Nick. This is Nick. And here is Jonathan Wilson, on how Sergio Aguero has gone all-in with Pep Guardiola’s methods. Features a lovely picture of the two men, and of course some lovely numbers:The finishing has always been outstanding. Agüero has scored 204 goals in 295 appearances for City in all competitions, including 146 in 208 Premier League games, five times getting more than 20 in a season. He has surpassed Eric Brook as City’s all-time leading scorer. Only nine players have scored more Premier League goals than him (none at a higher ratio of goals per game) and Les Ferdinand (149) and Michael Owen (150) could be surpassed in a couple of weeks. Another 18 goals would take him past Jermain Defoe and Robbie Fowler to sixth in the list. Another 30 and he surpasses Thierry Henry as the player to have scored most Premier League goals for a single club.Talking of lunch, I’m going for mine. Another Nick – Mr Nicholas Miller, to be precise – will be your spirit guide for the next half-hour or thereabouts.It’s almost lunchtime – well it is here anyway – and what’s better at lunchtime than a quiz? Nothing, that’s what! So here is Paul Campbell’s sports quiz of the week – learn some stuff here and impress with it in the pub a few short hours from now:Interested in hearing from fans lower down the leagues, obviously. Anyone watching that Boro-West Brom game later? The Baggies seem to have cut loose a little under Darren Moore – Matt Phillips is on fire – but Boro are flying high and have a certain Tony Pulis at the helm. I suspect history will judge Pulis’s time at The Hawthorns better than currently seems the case. Do you?Is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang enduring a BARREN RUN? Or perhaps even a CRISIS? No, of course he isn’t – he missed a couple of chances against Chelsea, that’s all. But in this day and age the smallest thing becomes a Thing and risks becoming entirely self-fulfilling, so here’s Unai Emery feeling obliged to respond to a question about his striker, and here too is me reproducing those comments and being part of the very problem I describe:The brilliant Marcela Mora y Araujo has interviewed Tata Martino – once of Barcelona, now of Atlanta United. It is worth your time:Here’s some more Warnock, in our second attempt to jog Charles Antaki’s memory – he and his lads are Huddersfield fanboys, it turns out!James and William, my two boys, were with me at the end of the season, and we were jumping up and down when they stayed up at Chelsea. Not for selfish reasons about us wanting to get promotion, but just because we wanted Huddersfield to stay up. It was a remarkable achievement and it does show you what can be achieved. It gets more difficult. Even the money Huddersfield have spent is quite remarkable compared to a few years ago. We’re at the bottom end of that and we have to try and creep up and catch them up.” Here’s the Manchester United women’s captain, Alex Greenwood, ahead of their home curtain raiser against Reading:“It’s an absolute honour to not only lead this football club, Manchester United, but this group of girls. What a fantastic group we’ve got and everyday there’s massive improvement and we’re gelling really nicely. I really can’t wait to lead this team out in front of our home crowd on Saturday. I think we’ll play a style of play that will keep fans coming back.”And on the revitalised club’s prospects of success:And what a time to unleash it! I watched Hertha play Schalke there two or three seasons back, admittedly as part of a stag do – I recall slurring excitedly to a group of nonplussed compadres about the merits of a young(er) Leroy Sane.Shaun Dyche made six changes last night – suggesting he wants his bread buttered firmly on the Premier League side, which is another of those cases that makes you wonder what the point of anything actually is. The likes of Joe Hart, James Tarkowski and Aaron Lennon could step back in against Fulham though. Can this lot work their way to a first EePeeEll win of the season? Hart, Heaton, Lowton, Taylor, Tarkowski, Mee, Gibson, Ward, Bardsley, Long, Cork, Gudmundsson, Hendrick, Westwood, Lennon, Vokes, Barnes, Wood, Walters, Vydra.Are you going to a game this weekend? Tell me about the game. Especially if it’s a slightly offbeat one. Panini Cheapskates has gone in high with his offering but if you’re checking out a great prospect in the Latvian second ision then this blog is all yours.In the absence of your fondest Grant Holt memories, and just to scare Charles Antaki further, here’s what NEIL WARNOCK has to go with against the Terriers. Aron Gunnarsson isn’t ready to return quite yet looks like another couple of weeks for him: Etheridge, Smithies, Peltier, Richards, Cunningham, Morrison, Bamba, Manga, Bennett, Arter, Damour, Ralls, Camarasa, Paterson, Mendez-Laing, Hoilett, Murphy, Reid, Zohore, Ward, Madine.A former Premier League striker and leading figure in Norwich City’s hall of fame retires ... with a word for the h8rs and the doubtrs:“Ought there have been a trigger warning?” asks a terrified Charles Antaki of my harmless Neil Warnock update. “When I saw the words ‘Neil Warnock’ I realised that he had appeared in a dream I had last night. Fortunately I remember nothing about it other than that it was deeply creepy and upsetting (which is of course unfair since apparently he’s a very nice man). But it might portend something for Cardiff fans, though why it came to me, and not one of them, I don’t know.”Not quite enough info yet for me to try and unpack that for you, Charles, but let us know if – say – Tony Pulis appears next time you go for some shut-eye.Panini Cheapskates have emailed us about a football weekend with a difference:“What’s in store this football weekend, you ask? Something truly extraordinary might be taking place here in a quiet corner of Oxford. My club Union Street is hosting a small 6-team tournament over the Bank Holiday which I think may be in with a shout of having the most eclectic lineup ever boasted by a single tournament:One bog standard Division 15-ish outfit (us, the hosts)A team of footballing archaeologistsTwo German teams who run mainly on alcoholA women’s team playing their first *ever* 11-a-side gamesAnd ... actual former Dutch Champions Be Quick 1887 who took the title off Ajax in 1920“We have almost no idea what to expect from this shambles. Wish us luck.”Now this is more like it! Can *you* brag of a more rag-tag lineup than this?Neil Warnock is talking. Cardiff, who’ve played some fairly nice stuff to far without really finishing it off, have an abundance of striker to choose from and he says he’ll give them all a go in the near future. Can they stay up?Here’s a Liverpool story for you – they aren’t for sale, but they’d not say no to a little more cash!“I have big expectations for Jadon Sancho at Dortmund this year,” announces Jonathan Bennett. “He’s only just turned 18, but looks a real talent - my hope is that he will establish himself in the Dortmund team by Christmas and be an England star by the end of the season. Too much pressure? Let me just mention that at his age I was had already set myself the goal of achieving a perfect score in Donkey Kong Bowling on the GameCube. It’s all about belief.”I’d taken Notts County down to the Conference in Championship Manager, so you’re both well ahead.Jack Wilshere is up against his old club tomorrow. Emotions to run high!

No more than the talk in London is all about, say, Arsenal. In the east, fans of 1. FC Union would certainly have something to say about that crazy notion! Neither are really greatly “Berlin” teams, in some ways, one out towards Spandau and the other in Köpenick. There are other teams here who are more central and one’s reported as linked to foreign investment (Viktoria Berlin 1899) so the usual speculation is increasing.“Hertha are stable at the moment but, if they need a coaching change, I know the man for the job, to try to raise the profile. A man who was seen there before his most recent appointment, who is perhaps a bit unsettled now, and who clearly prefers big city life (even moaning about Manchester basically not being London in his time after arriving). Hertha’s a US venture capital supported outfit now, but you’d not really know.“Anyway, the Bundesliga may be starting but we are long since up and running lower down. We’re on matchday 3 in League 2, and had round 1 of the Cup (Pokal). Those of us in league two have been joined by big names Hamburg (soundly thrashed 0-3 at home in their opener by Holsten Kiel) and Cologne. There are other games tonight. I will be at Darmstadt 98, hosting MSV Duisburg. Looking forward to my first game of the season.”Lovely stuff. Hope to get over there and catch a few games during the season (in fact I always fancied Darmstadt but haven’t they got rid of that massive terrace now?), whether in the line of work of pleasure. I’ll be in Munich for Germany v France in a couple of weeks, but not sure that really counts.A reminder to get your emails and tweets in – what’s in store for your football weekend?Should Dunk not make it, then in from the start will come Leon Balogun.

Some of these men will have the answer: Ryan, Button, Steele, Bernardo, Bong, Duffy, Dunk, Balogun, Schelotto, Suttner, Bissouma, Stephens, Propper, Kayal, Knockaert, March, Gross, Jahanbakhsh, Locadia, Murray.Have your ears feasted on Football Weekly Extra yet? No? Then let them:Bournemouth play Everton on Saturday – so Eddie Howe has been waxing lyrical about Marco Silva:I think Marco’s done well with the team that he’s inherited. He’s only been there a short time but I think he’s made definite changes to their way of playing. You can see that they’re implementing new things and doing that really well. They’ve had two good results so far, another team in form so I think it will be a very attractive game. I think you will have two teams playing a good style of football.”Speaking of Burnley – they’ll want to have cleared their heads from last night’s controversial defeat to Olympiakos in time for the trip to Craven Cottage. Early indications are that they’re not taking to the Thursday-Sunday routine brilliantly, although I’m not sure they’ll have to worry about that for much longer.Fulham team news – they have Denis Odoi back from suspension for Sunday’s showdown with Burnley, but must do without Tim Ream, Floyd Ayite and Alfie Mawson. They’ll choose from these chaps: Fabri, Chambers, Le Marchand, Christie, Bryan, Sessegnon, Odoi, McDonald, Cairney, Schurrle, Seri, Mitrovic, Rico, Fosu-Mensah, Kebano, Johansen, Cisse, Vietto, Kamara, Zambo Anguissa.What are this morning’s red-hot football rumours? Don’t ask me – ask Barry Glendenning:“With the Bundesliga race pretty much over already,” emails Tim, “all talk here in Berlin is about the new stadium planned for Hertha. Can’t come too soon, their fans are passionate (and scarf skirt enthusiasts) but struggle to half-fill the Olympiastadion for most games, which always makes for a strange atmosphere of intense passion mirrored by loads of empty blue seats.”Yep – in a stadium that held, say, 50,000 fans Hertha would be quite a proposition. I would *love it* if Berlin could boast a fearsome football team. Hasn’t quite happened yet but the potential is enormous.Team news is filtering in, club by club, so we’ll bring you the best of it. Mohamed Elyounoussi could be back in action after a hamstring injury when Southampton play Leicester. Mark Hughes’s pack of cards is thus: McCarthy, Gunn, Hoedt, Bertrand, Vestergaard, Stephens, Soares, Lemina, Romeu, Ward-Prowse, Redmond, Austin, Elyounoussi, Ings, Targett, Yoshida, Hojbjerg, Gabbiadini, Armstrong, Long.Some early team news – West Ham will miss Mark Noble for the trip to Arsenal tomorrow, as he has a back injury. Presumably that wasn’t picked up while wading through treacle to catch Callum Wilson last weekend. Andy Carroll, Manuel Lanzini and Winston Reid remain absent the tools Manuel Pellegrini has to select from look a little bit like this: Fabianski, Adrian, Fredericks, Zabaleta, Ogbonna, Diop, Balbuena, Rice, Cresswell, Masuaku, Obiang, Wilshere, Sanchez, Antonio, Yarmolenko, Snodgrass, Arnautovic, Perez, Hernandez, Anderson.It’s not such a good start to Friday for Nick Daws. Scunthorpe have just sacked him ... which seems slightly harsh given that he was only appointed to the role “permanently” in May, and had picked up four points in four games. It might have something to do with their most recent result, though: a 0-5 home reverse to Joey Barton’s Fleetwood!Have you seen All Or Nothing – the Man City version – yet? I have resisted ... but I might be more tempted to watch a documentary about Sunderland’s 2017-18 season. Yes, this is actually a thing. What would you call it, given the chance?Gott sei dank, es ist Freitag! One for our Bundesliga lovers, there, as Germany’s big boys get cracking this weekend – tonight, in fact, with Bayern Munich hosting Hoffenheim. Title race ahoy? Possibly not, but one can dream!Needless to there’s more than your fill of English action coming up over the next few days too. Man City travel to Wolves! Liverpool host Brighton! Tottenham travel to Manchester United for the final throes of a super soaraway Bank Holiday weekend! And there will be football played in the Championship tonight, with Middlesbrough up against free-scoring (do not adjust your sets!) West Brom.So we’ll be looking ahead to all that and more – there’ll be press conferences to catch up on, snippets of team news, the usual ephemera that blow into our paths and cause fleeting mirth during a given day.

When I try to picture my daughter when she’s not there, I see nothingI was seven when, in hindsight, I first questioned my imagination. I remember watching the first Harry Potter film and my friend, who was a huge fan, was complaining that the characters weren’t how she imagined them to be. I couldn’t understand what she meant because, in my mind, they had never been images at all, just concepts. When I shut my eyes, I see nothing. It is black. I have no visual imagination.I thought everyone’s minds worked this way until about two years ago, when I stumbled across a blog post about aphantasia a condition where you lack a functioning mind’s eye. I was 23, and it blew my mind to learn that others could visualise things. I’d never known any different but it was clear I had aphantasia, too, and a lot of things started to make more sense.I began to look it up online and in science journals. For me, imagination had always been conceptual. I could never visualise a crown, a unicycle or an ice-cream in my hand. If someone asked me to close my eyes and picture myself by the sea, I would see nothing.I was intrigued to know if it is inherited, so I asked my parents. My mother thought I was lying. “No, no,” she said, “you have a wonderful imagination.” For her, things are exceptionally vivid but I think my father is like me (although people have differing degrees: some people see fuzzy images, some see none at all). I suppose you could say my imagination is broken, but each of us can only experience our own thoughts, so it is hard to compare. For this reason, it is difficult to know how many people have aphantasia, but academics have developed a test using visualisation questions. It has been associated with similar conditions such as face blindness or tone deafness, though it does not affect cognitive or physical function.A good little test for me is drawing. I can copy things almost like for like if they are in front of me, but if I were to draw from my imagination it would look terrible. It doesn’t mean you cannot be creative you just have to adapt.I am currently studying for a PhD in reproductive biology in Manchester, and I have found others in the sciences like me. Lacking a visual element to my imagination meant that tests of memory recall were difficult. For example, we had to learn a cell-counting technique but, regardless of how many times I read it, it didn’t make sense. When I came to do it in the lab, I understood it immediately. If you have a visual imagination you can look at a diagram and it triggers your memory but I learn by repetition or physically doing something.I’m dreadful with directions because I can’t remember landmarks. I’m terrible with faces. In that sense, it’s a little sad because I cannot picture my five-year-old daughter when I’m not with her. But I could tell you how she looks, where she has a freckle, what her hair is like, from repetitive memory.I still enjoy reading – sci-fi and fantasy – but detailed literature is a slog. The Lord Of The Rings and A Game Of Thrones are extremely descriptive series that I would love to enjoy, but quickly become bored with.Strangely, I am a lucid dreamer, so it seems only my voluntary visual imagination is affected. Although, I never really understood the whole “counting sheep” thing as a child: I couldn’t see any sheep so I assumed it was just a synonym for counting.I’d love to take myself back to certain memories, such as when I’ve had an amazing holiday or when I first held my daughter. I can only look at photos. I’m really envious of people who can picture themselves on a desert island to relieve stress. On the flip side, I suspect it’s helpful in cases where worry may be overwhelming, in that I don’t ever spiral into crippling fear and imagine a situation over and over, as some people do.I sometimes wonder if my daughter has aphantasia, but nothing she has said or done so far makes me think so. I asked her what it looks like when she closes her eyes, and she said she sees things like a video playing in her head.I’d love to experience life with a mind’s eye. I think it’d be cool – and beneficial – to imagine things so vividly. If you offered me a day with a visual imagination, I’d swap. Except I think it’d be so brilliant that I wouldn’t want to give it back.As told to Deborah Linton• Do you have an experience to share?

From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The only solution is integration. By  Melissa BennUnlikely as it might sound, one of the most electric political meetings I have ever attended was a lecture on the Finnish educational system given by Pasi Sahlberg, the Finnish educator and author, in London in the spring of 2012. Sahlberg, who was speaking to a packed committee room 14 of the House of Commons – the most magnificent of a run of grand meeting rooms that directly overlook the Thames – has a rather laconic manner of delivery. However, in this particular instance, his flat speaking style proved the perfect vehicle for an unexpectedly radical message.Sahlberg described how Finnish education had evolved, in the postwar period, from a steeply hierarchical one, rather like our own, made up of private, selective and less-well regarded “local” schools, to become a system in which every child attends the “common school”. The long march to educational reform was partly initiated to strengthen the Finnish nation after the second world war, and to defend it against Russian incursions in particular.Finland’s politicians and educational figures recognised that a profoundly unequal education system did not simply reproduce inequality down the generations, but weakened the fabric of the nation itself. Following a long period of discussion – which drew in figures from the political right and left, educators and academics – Finland abolished its fee-paying schools and instituted a nationwide comprehensive system from the early 1970s onwards. Not only did such reforms lead to the closing of the attainment gap between the richest and poorest students, it also turned Finland into one of the global educational success stories of the modern era.I was recently reminded of this meeting when reading a short pamphlet published in November 1964 by the Young Fabian authors Howard Glennerster and Richard Pryke on “the public schools”. Much of the pamphlet covers the same ground occasionally trod today by the odd brave soul: the social isiveness bred by a parallel school system for the better-off the disproportionate access of privately educated pupils to Oxford and Cambridge and then to the top jobs in society the dispersal of bursaries largely to the cash-strapped middle class and the numerous canny tax schemes enjoyed by both private school parents and the schools themselves that amount to large state subsidies to the most privileged in society. The pamphlet ended by dismissing the foolishness of those who say that state schools should “catch up” with the private sector. The answer was integration.It also quoted the Labour party manifesto of 1964, which promised that “Labour will set up an educational trust to advise on the best way of integrating the private schools into the state system of education”. It also included an extract from a document titled Signposts for the Sixties, which provided a statement of Labour party “home policy” submitted by the national executive committee to the 60th annual party conference: “We are convinced that the nation should now take the decision to end the social inequalities and educational anomalies arising from the existence of a highly influential and privileged private sector of education, outside the state system.”The Young Fabian authors concluded that “in the future, these statements may be seen to mark a turning point in the development of British education … now Labour is committed to action, and action there will have to be”. Sadly, it was not to be. As David Kynaston and George Kynaston noted in a long, cogent consideration of the issue published in New Statesman in 2014, the Labour party, if not the wider left, has largely remained silent on the issue of private schools for 40 years.We urgently need to renew the conversation about the private-public ide, and move beyond the superficial, profoundly apolitical debates of recent years. These have chiefly been characterised by the rolling out of the same information again and again, almost as if the private schools were not human creations but unchallengeable phenomena like the weather or religious deities. Over and over we are told: private schools achieve higher results their graduates vacuum up the majority of places at the best universities they take all the top jobs they dominate the top of society. There is, as a result, a continual stirring up (with the liberal help of a few capital letters) of resentment, envy and panic – “Private pupils are SIX TIMES more likely to get A* grades at GCSEs than those at state schools” “A third of private pupils score 3 A* grades at A-level compared to one in TEN at state schools” – finely seasoned with a good dollop of hopelessness: “The awful truth: to get ahead you need a private education.”Moreover, many people today still peddle the line that those prescient Young Fabian authors of half a century ago urged us not to take, which is to implore our often-battered state system to close the widening ide through non-stop “improvement”. During a BBC Radio 4 debate on education in the runup to the 2015 general election, Fraser Nelson, editor of the rightwing weekly the Spectator, argued that what was needed was more visits by the influential and successful to state schools, more internships and mentoring of the disadvantaged. Useful as such initiatives might be, to some iniduals, it is hard to see how such stopgap methods will do more than chip away at a yawning structural ide.We can’t expect the Conservatives to say much about private education. After all, it underwrites a hierarchical form of social organisation, and philosophy of inidual freedom, intrinsic to the party’s philosophy. Labour’s position in the postwar period – from roughly the late 40s to the early 70s – was, as I have indicated, to deplore the ide and promise to do something about it. In 1997, New Labour got rid of the assisted-places scheme, a system of subsidies for private schools. Yet the most marked feature of the post-1997 New Labour years has been the suggestion that state education could benefit from imitation of the autonomy, pedagogy, disciplinary atmosphere, as well as the direct patronage, of the private sector.Under this rubric, two distinct policies were pursued. One was to lure cash-strapped private schools into the state sector, via the academies and free school movement. To date, a handful of private schools have come into state education via this route, but enjoy preferential admissions arrangements and other advantages that some argue have intensified stratification within the state system. The other, much-heralded path – particularly under education secretaries Andrew Adonis and Michael Gove – was that of “partnership”: the idea that private schools should sponsor struggling academies. Spurred on by a mix of duty, guilt, interest in innovation or a combination of all these, some schools – including Brighton College, Dulwich, Eton, Highgate, King’s Canterbury, Wellington and Uppingham – joined the scheme. However, a number subsequently pulled out. As one private school head is reputed to have said: “I take my hat off to these guys who run academies. I wouldn’t last five minutes in that environment.” Former chief inspector of schools Michael Wilshaw was sceptical of the arrangement, telling a gathering of private school heads that the so-called partnerships amounted to no more than “crumbs off your tables, leading more to famine than feast”.If we are to move the conversation on, then, we need to be clear that the success of private education is not replicable precisely because it offers the already socially and economically privileged superior resources and opportunities that inevitably augment their confidence and capabilities in every sphere. Private day schools now cost, on average, £14,500 a year – more than the annual disposable income of the average English family. Boarding is a great deal more costly. The annual fees of a top private school such as Westminster, which sends more students to Oxbridge than any other school in the country, are around £35,000 a year for boarders. Compare this with the average per-pupil spend in a state secondary school of between £4,000 and £6,000 a year. But the difference is not only in simple resources, for the spread of pupils at many state schools will include those from deprived or struggling families, compounding the pressures on their education and those who teach them, while a private school is in general recruiting from the already affluent, literate and enterprising. Thus, we need to publicly acknowledge that the success of private education is far less to do with character building or autonomous governance than the powerful alchemy of several kinds of advantage.Now, more than ever, there is a strong moral and political argument in support of integration. At a time of growing ides and damaging inequality, we urgently need public institutions that bring the nation together, not further separate and ide us. For many in the UK, the idea of a unified education system to which all subscribe is too great a leap of the imagination, too daring a proposition – and yet the benefits of a common schooling could be immense.Finland teaches us not only that state education will never be considered truly first-rate until we give all our children the same high-quality schooling, but also that a country that educates its children together has a better chance of being at ease with itself than one that segregates different parts of the population from an early age. On a more raw political note, the greater the spread of families using a public service, the greater the pressure on politicians to commit sufficient funds to support it. Or as David Kynaston puts it, rather more amusingly: “One only has to witness pushy private-school parents on the touchline to realise that the state sector will never achieve its full capability without them.”It may be that the problem with private education is not that it is too expensive, but that it is too cheap. Certainly, low-level growling about the extent of state subsidy of private schools has a long history. The Charities Act 2006 removed the presumption that charities automatically provide public benefit, and decisions on this question were shifted to the Charity Commission, which, in statutory guidance, “ruled that people in poverty should not be excluded from the services of these ‘charities’ their benefits should be made available to a ‘sufficient’ section of the population, be quantifiable and reported on annually”. Since then, there has been intermittent and testy discussion as to whether the sharing of playing fields and libraries, and the provision of Latin taster classes and so on to neighbouring state schools constitutes sufficient public benefit. In 2014, Tristram Hunt, then Labour shadow minister for education, boldly proposed that private schools should lose some of their business-rate relief if they didn’t form more meaningful partnerships with state schools. There were even rumours, in 2017, that Theresa May would withdraw charitable status from private schools that refused to participate in the sponsorship of academies and free schools.“We recognise we have to give the schools business-rates relief,” Ross argued, “but we considered the time was right to seek better engagement with the schools and see whether their delivery of public benefit could be aligned with tackling local priorities … In an area with national pressure on education, plus county pressure on children’s services and libraries, and our borough having deprived wards in which literacy is identified as a barrier to families accessing services and employment, we need to look at, and beyond, the current arrangements.”The mood music is changing. In the runup to the 2017 general election, Jeremy Corbyn proposed that VAT should be charged on private school fees in order to subsidise free lunches for all primary school children. In December of that year, the Scottish government accepted the recommendations of the Barclay review that Scottish private schools should lose their business-rate relief, with the exception of some specialist and special-needs schools.Robert Verkaik, author of the recently published Posh Boys: How the English Public Schools Ruin Britain, calculates that “the UK spends more on private education than any other country in the developed world”. Private schools could have been expected to pay £1.16bn in business rates between 2017 and 2022. As charities, he argues, they will pay just £634.26m, equating to circa £522.31m in savings. Eton, for example, will save an estimated £4.1m in business rates over the next five years. Yet state schools, which are not charities and do not receive fee income, must pay the full rate. Verkaik also investigates the manner in which private schools, as charities, are exempt from UK tax on most types of investment income, and do not pay corporation tax, which means every penny of profit a public school makes is tax-free. If this income were taxed, it could raise up to £500m a year. He has also highlighted the considerable sums of money used to subsidise private education for the children of military families. By removing some forms of public subsidy, and perhaps taxing school fees (a report by the Fabian Society in 2010 suggested that introducing VAT on private school fees could raise around £1.5bn annually), private education might start to become more like a luxury brand, encouraging a significant proportion of parents to choose the state sector.A number of leading private schools have already indicated a willingness to participate in the scheme. However, given the overwhelming evidence concerning the social discrimination inherent in 11-plus-style tests, such a plan would exclude the genuinely poor, further deprive state schools of motivated and high-attaining pupils, justify selection at a time when it is seriously being questioned in the state sector, and bestow an additional, and wholly unjustifiable, moral halo upon private education. Earlier schemes of a similar nature, such as the assisted-places scheme, ended up largely subsidising the already educationally advantaged on moderate or low incomes.Given the considerable and sustained advantage that private-school students currently enjoy in terms of access to top universities, and from there to the most influential and well-paid jobs, there is also a case for an increase in contextual admissions criteria – ensuring that universities take into account economic and educational contexts when offering places, particularly at so-called top universities.“Potential” is always a tricky quality to judge. In a recent blogpost headlined “Making Oxbridge entry matter less”, the education researcher Rebecca Allen described a period she spent conducting admissions interviews at an Oxbridge college. “The experience completely revolutionised my view that university admissions were efficiently selecting students by ability … Those who performed exceptionally well at interview often didn’t seem to turn out to be genuinely interested and motivated by their subject.” (Allen knew this because she also worked as a supervisor of first-year students.) In other words, confident self-presentation may not always indicate authentic passion in a reverse manifestation of the same question, one state-school head told me that some of his most brilliant sixth-form students were not – yet – able to translate their passions into an acceptable form of fluency, but could be taught to do so.Allen also noted that accompanying “thinking skills” tests were clearly not tutor-proof, and confirmed that disadvantaged students were often not prepared for the demands of the interview. In the long term, we need a fresh approach to teaching and learning that will produce greater numbers of intellectually confident and questioning pupils. In the short term, given that exam results determine entry to all universities, there is a strong case for lower entrance requirements for those who have had a less well resourced education, especially since research shows that state-school students admitted to highly selective universities with the same A-level results as their private-school peers outperform the latter.Lady Margaret Hall in Oxford has recently set up a free, fully funded foundation year for students usually “underrepresented” at Oxbridge, to give disadvantaged students a taster of demanding courses at an elite institution and aid applications to university entrance proper. While some might question the sensitivity of such a publicly visible separate track for those from more modest backgrounds, it is an indication of a new determination to shift entrenched inequalities.The point is that if private-school attendance were no longer associated with a smooth transition to a top university, there would be less incentive for parents to pay fees in order to educate their children separately.Within the state sector in England, there is a less daunting transition to be managed in terms of selective education. Kent, Lincolnshire and Buckinghamshire have fully selective systems, pretty similar to those operated in the postwar period. In Birmingham, to take one example of how selection operates in the big cities, eight grammar schools cream off the most motivated and high-achieving students and make secondary transfer for all Birmingham’s parents a complex, messy and socially unfair business. While there are only 163 grammars in England – many of which are expanding fast under this government – it is estimated that the secondary education of one in 10 children nationwide is affected by the nearby presence of a selective school.We know the negative impact that grammars have on other local schools. Expensive private coaching, beyond the reach of most families, is a crucial part of winning a place at a selective school. While some ethnic groups do better than others in selective systems, grammars disproportionately exclude children from minority backgrounds. Selective schools are more likely to be rated outstanding as other local schools suffer, their pupil intake out of balance in terms of the proportion of disadvantaged, disengaged children – many of whom are demoralised by having failed the 11-plus and told that they are not up to the mark – or those with special needs. It is often hard to recruit and retain teachers. These de facto “secondary moderns” – a term no modern politician will go near, with its reference to the now widely discredited system of the postwar period, which ided children into grammar and secondary modern schools, largely along lines of class – are more likely to be judged “inadequate” or “failing”. And thus the vicious circle is complete.Lobby groups as politically erse as Comprehensive Future, a cross-party campaign group committed to phasing out selection and supporting fair admissions policies, and Bright Blue, a conservative thinktank, agree with this conclusion. Comprehensive Future proposes that we slowly open grammar schools up to a fully comprehensive intake: ensuring local populations can decide the best means of transition, what use to make of existing grammar-school buildings, and how to prepare teachers in the selective sector to teach all children to the highest level.Such a move would complete the reforms that occurred across much of the UK in the 60s and 70s. Change is still happening today. In 2016, Guernsey, a small crown dependency, voted to transform its school system, converting the island’s single grammar school and three secondary moderns into a unified system. For decades, campaigners against selection have been patiently arguing their case, putting forward the evidence and attempting to persuade others. Finally, they won. From 2019, Guernsey will have a fully comprehensive secondary school system, joining some of the most successful and modern education systems in the world. It is time England did the same.

It is not yet clear whether his successor Jeremy Hunt found a face-down stone that Johnson had somehow missed or instead a confluence of new forces has prompted her temporary reprieve.The UK ambassador in Tehran, Rob Macaire, had been given little warning of her release and she herself was given only a few minutes’ notice.The release can be seen either as a welcoming gift to the incoming Hunt, a reward for specific recent diplomatic gestures made by the UK, or an indicator of the extent to which Iran, under massive US sanctions pressures, needs all the friends it can find in Europe. It is quite possible all three factors played a role in the often opaque thinking inside Tehran’s dual regime. A visit to Tehran by the UK Foreign Office permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, in late July may also have been pivotal.Since his appointment, Hunt had made the Zaghari-Ratcliffe file a priority, meeting her husband Richard twice for lengthy discussions, describing his sympathy as the father of young children from a mixed race marriage.Hunt did not leap to escalate the crisis in a way that would have offended Iran by giving her diplomatic protection, a status the Zaghari-Ratcliffe family have been seeking from the Foreign Office for many months.He went out of his way via McDonald to assure the Iranians that his elevation to the foreign secretaryship would not lead to any change to the UK’s support for the Iranian nuclear deal, the linchpin of Iranian diplomacy. Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal in April.Indeed, Hunt signed a joint statement with France and Germany on 6 August, the day the first round of US anti-Tehran sanctions kicked in, defending the deal as “a key element of the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture, crucial for the security of Europe, the region, and the entire world”.Macaire, days after presenting his own credentials as ambassador to Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, tweeted the statement saying “its message could not be clearer”.In interviews surrounding his visit this week to Washington, and in his encounter with US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, Hunt stood his ground, insisting excessive US pressure on Tehran was only likely to lead to a regime more hostile to the west. In this, he was erging from the US on its pre-eminent foreign policy issue, a point that McDonald hammered home in his Tehran visit.But the UK has also been making some quiet gestures of goodwill towards Iran. For example, the Iranian embassy in London has been allowed to open a bank account.The head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Ali Akbar Salehi, this week highlighted how the UK – jointly with China – had assumed responsibility for helping Iran rebuild its heavy water reactor in Arak. The UK involvement, volunteered at a meeting with Iranian officials in Vienna in July, is designed to reduce the amount of plutonium produced by the reactor as a by-product, so ensuring Iran remains inside the terms of the deal. The additional UK cooperation came after US technical experts pulled out.There have also been tentative signs of progress on the single biggest blockage in the bilateral relationship – the UK’s refusal to repay £450m outstanding debt on a 40-year-old arms deal, because of a dispute over the interest rate on the debt and the difficulty of making a payment that is not in breach of international sanctions. Tehran suggested in recent weeks that the payment need not be made in cash but in kind through medicines, so circumventing sanctions. A sympathetic British response could end a diplomatic sore that began in 2002 and has resulted in successive court judgements against the UK.Finally, Iran has come to accept that the EU is sincere in trying to soften the impact of US secondary sanctions on EU firms active in Iran.Tehran always saw the nuclear deal as a simple trade-off. It would hold off on restarting the nuclear programme so long as the lifting of sanctions led to a substantial rise in western investment.The difficulty has been that EU multinationals, faced with a choice between investing in Iran, and as a consequence facing US Treasury sanctions on its often larger US outlets, are choosing Washington over Tehran. The dollar still rules. An EU €18m package of aid to Iran announced by Brussels on Thursday hardly fills the blight on European investment caused by the US sanctions threat.The EU’s efforts to prevent an exodus from Iran has not worked, as firm after firm has announced it was abandoning planned investments. The British Airways announcement on Thursday that it was suspending its uncommercial service to Tehran symbolises how hopes of a business revival have been disappointed.British officials say it is not widely understood how the US has chosen sanctions policy, and the dominance of the dollar, as an instrument with which to impose its foreign policy rule on Europe. In Brussels, Berlin and Paris, it has prompted an anguished debate about how the intrusiveness of secondary sanctions is exposing the lack of true European economic and foreign policy sovereignty.Tehran may have realised that, given the geopolitical stakes ahead, anything standing in the way of the support of the UK’s newforeign secretary was worth re-examining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9377d72c395165d8f449c6cf926b6c0b492cf44/0_190_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c40bc8c2c4827e180761a62869979569","title":"no healthy level of alcohol consumption says major study","story":"Governments should consider advising people to abstain entirely, say authors Even the occasional drink is harmful to health, according to the largest and most detailed research carried out on the effects of alcohol, which suggests governments should think of advising people to abstain completely.The uncompromising message comes from the authors of the Global Burden of Diseases study, a rolling project based at the University of Washington, in Seattle, which produces the most comprehensive data on the causes of illness and death in the world.Current alcohol drinking habits pose “dire ramifications for future population health in the absence of policy action today”, says the paper. “Alcohol use contributes to health loss from many causes and exacts its toll across the life, particularly among men.”Most national guidelines suggest there are health benefits to one or two glasses of wine or beer a day, they say. “Our results show that the safest level of drinking is none.”The study was carried out by researchers at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), who investigated levels of alcohol consumption and health effects in 195 countries between 1990 to 2016. They used data from 694 studies to work out how common drinking was and from 592 studies including 28 million people worldwide to work out the health risks.Moderate drinking has been condoned for years on the assumption that there are some health benefits. A glass of red wine a day has long been said to be good for the heart. But although the researchers did find low levels of drinking offered some protection from heart disease, and possibly from diabetes and stroke, the benefits were far outweighed by alcohol’s harmful effects, they said.In the UK, the chief medical officer Sally Davies has said there is no safe level of drinking, but the guidance suggests that drinkers consume no more than 14 units a week to keep the risks low. Half a pint of average-strength lager contains one unit and a 125ml glass of wine contains around 1.5 units.“Alcohol poses dire ramifications for future population health in the absence of policy action today. Our results indicate that alcohol use and its harmful effects on health could become a growing challenge as countries become more developed, and enacting or maintaining strong alcohol control policies will be vital,” said the report’s senior author, Prof Emmanuela Gakidou.“Worldwide we need to revisit alcohol control policies and health programmes, and to consider recommendations for abstaining from alcohol. These include excise taxes on alcohol, controlling the physical availability of alcohol and the hours of sale, and controlling alcohol advertising. Any of these policy actions would contribute to reductions in population-level consumption, a vital step toward decreasing the health loss associated with alcohol use.”Dr Robyn Burton, of King’s College London, said in a commentary in the Lancet that the conclusions of the study were clear and unambiguous. “Alcohol is a colossal global health issue and small reductions in health-related harms at low levels of alcohol intake are outweighed by the increased risk of other health-related harms, including cancer,” she wrote.“There is strong support here for the guideline published by the Chief Medical Officer of the UK who found that there is ‘no safe level of alcohol consumption’.”Public health policy should be to prioritise measures to reduce the numbers who drink through price increases, taxation, or setting the price according to the strength of the drink (minimum unit pricing), followed by curbs on marketing and restricting the places where people can buy alcohol.“These approaches should come as no surprise because these are also the most effective measures for curbing tobacco-related harms, another commercially mediated disease, with an increasing body of evidence showing that controlling obesity will require the same measures,” she wrote.Ben Butler, a Drinkaware spokesperson, said: “This new study supports existing evidence about the harms associated with alcohol. Our research shows that over a quarter of UK adults typically exceed the low risk drinking guidelines and are running the risk of serious long term illnesses.”But David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor for the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said the data showed only a very low level of harm in moderate drinkers and suggested UK guidelines were very low risk.“Given the pleasure presumably associated with moderate drinking, claiming there is no ‘safe’ level does not seem an argument for abstention,” he said. “There is no safe level of driving, but government do not recommend that people avoid driving. Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d30fa621ea0013539395efaf3d5d0976b9925e/0_69_4498_2700/master/4498.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce69e1e6fb4e840079122f756a66b34b","title":"russian trolls spread vaccine misinformation on twitter","story":"Study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, tweeting about vaccinesBots and Russian trolls spread misinformation about vaccines on Twitter to sow ision and distribute malicious content before and during the American presidential election, according to a new study.Scientists at George Washington University, in Washington DC, made the discovery while trying to improve social media communications for public health workers, researchers said. Instead, they found trolls and bots skewing online debate and upending consensus about vaccine safety.The study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, as well as marketing and malware bots, tweeting about vaccines. Russian trolls played both sides, the researchers said, tweeting pro- and anti-vaccine content in a politically charged context.“These trolls seem to be using vaccination as a wedge issue, promoting discord in American society,” Mark Dredze, a team member and professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins, which was also involved in the study, said.“By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases. Viruses don’t respect national boundaries.”The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, comes as Europe faces one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, one which has been partly attributed to falling vaccination rates. In the first six months of 2018, there were 41,000 cases of measles across the continent, more than in the entirety of 2017. Meanwhile, the rate of children not receiving vaccines for non-medical reasons is climbing in the US.“The vast majority of Americans believe vaccines are safe and effective, but looking at Twitter gives the impression that there is a lot of debate,” said David Broniatowski, an assistant professor in George Washington’s School of Engineering and Applied Science.“It turns out that many anti-vaccine tweets come from accounts whose provenance is unclear. These might be bots, human users or ‘cyborgs’ – hacked accounts that are sometimes taken over by bots. Although it’s impossible to know exactly how many tweets were generated by bots and trolls, our findings suggest that a significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas.”Russian trolls appeared to link vaccination to controversial issues in the US. Their vaccine-related content made appeals to God, or argued about race, class and animal welfare, researchers said. Often, the tweets targeted the legitimacy of the US government.“Did you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS,” read one Russian troll tweet. Another said: “#VaccinateUS You can’t fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I’m for #vaccination!”“Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated anti-vaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord,” researchers concluded. “Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination.”Researchers examined a random sample of 1.7m tweets collected between July 2014 and September 2017 – the height of the American presidential campaign that led to Donald Trump’s victory. To identify bots, researchers compared the rate at which normal users tweeted about vaccines with the rate at which bots and trolls did so.“We started looking at the Russian trolls, because that data set became available in January,” said Broniatowski. “One of the first things that came out was they tweet about vaccines way more often than the average Twitter user.”Broniatowski said trolls tweeted about vaccines about 22 times more often than regular Twitter users, or about once every 550 tweets, versus every 12,000 tweets for human accounts.Researchers found different kinds of bots spread different kinds of misinformation. So-called “content polluters” used anti-vaccine messages as bait to entice their followers to click on advertisements and links to malicious websites. The study comes as social media companies struggle to clean their houses of misinformation. In February, Twitter deleted 3,800 accounts linked to the Russian government-backed Internet Research Agency, the same group researchers at George Washington examined. In April, Facebook removed 135 accounts linked to the same organization.This week, Facebook removed another 650 fake accounts linked to Russia and Iran meant to spread misinformation. Researchers did not study Facebook, though it remains a hub of anti-vaccination activity.“To me it’s actually impressive how well-organized and sophisticated the anti-vax movement has become,” said Dr Peter Hotez, the director of the Texas children’s hospital center for vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, and the father of an autistic child. Hotez, who maintains an active Twitter presence, said he struggled to identify whether Twitter accounts were human or bots.“There are clearly some well-known anti-vax activists that I know to look out for and I know to block or to mute, but that’s a minority,” said Hotez. “A lot of it just seems to come out of nowhere, and I’m always surprised by that.”Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) treat everyone’s data equally – whether that’s an email from your mother, a bank transfer or a streamed episode of The Handmaid’s Tale. It means that ISPs don’t get to choose which data is sent more quickly, and which sites get blocked or throttled (for example, slowing the delivery of a TV show because it is streamed by a video company that competes with a subsidiary of the ISP) and who has to pay extra. For this reason, some have described net neutrality as the\u0026nbsp“first amendment of the internet”.One of the most striking findings, Broniatowski said, was an apparent attempt by Russian trolls to Astroturf a vaccine debate using the hashtag #VaccinateUS. Accounts identified as controlled by the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm backed by the Russian government, were almost exclusively responsible for content emerging under #VaccinateUS.Some of the Russian trolls even specifically used a hashtag associated with Andrew Wakefield, the discredited former physician who published fraudulent papers linking vaccines with autism, such as #Vaxxed and #CDCWhistleblower. requested comment from Twitter and was referred to a blogpost in which the company said its “focus is increasingly on proactively identifying problematic accounts”, and that its system “identified and challenged” more than 9.9m potential spam accounts a week in May 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d6d9613f7ce30bd06a2c1bc1c50c532a86b68a/0_134_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2284200f8141894e0084103fba421449","title":"talking horses speed merchants collide and stradivarius chases 1m bonus at york","story":"Blue Point and Battaash renew their high-speed rivalry while stayer Straarius hopes to strike it richThe two extremes of thoroughbred performance are on show at York this afternoon, as Battaash and Blue Point, runner-up and winner respectively in the King’s Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot, resume their high-speed rivalry in the Nunthorpe Stakes, while Straarius chases a £1m bonus for completing the set in four of the season’s most valuable staying events.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTips by Greg WoodThere is, of course, more to it than that, as Blue Point was beaten on his next start when he stepped up to six furlongs in the July Cup while Battaash put up an exhilarating performance to win the King George V Stakes at Glorious Goodwood, where he overwhelmed his field with blistering speed on one of the fastest five-furlong tracks on the planet.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe King’s Stand, meanwhile, looked very much like a race where the most naturally talented horse was undone by the way that the contest developed.

But the biggest addition to the year’s final grand slam is the rebuilt Louis Armstrong Stadium, a gorgeous 14,061-seat venue that gives the event a second retractable-roof stadium – from none only three years ago. It is the final jewel in the United States Tennis Association’s five-year, $600m transformation of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York.Spectators got a first look at the terracotta-covered stadium at Wednesday’s formal dedication, where Michael Chang and James Blake defeated John and Patrick McEnroe in a legends doubles match before a crowd of several hundred onlookers as qualifying matches played out across the grounds.Designed by the Detroit architectural firm Rossetti, the new Louis Armstrong Stadium is the world’s first naturally ventilated tennis stadium with a retractable roof, eliminating the need for an air conditioning system. The lower bowl of the arena will require a reserved ticket when the tournament properly kicks off on Monday, while the upper tier will be general admission for anyone at Flushing Meadows.When Andy Murray saw off Novak Djokovic to win the US Open in 2012, it marked the fifth straight year the men’s singles final had been forced to Monday because of inclement conditions earlier in the fortnight. Eleven months later, the USTA announced the ambitious expansion plan that has resulted in the construction of roofs over the two biggest show courts.Danny Zausner, the chief operating officer at the National Tennis Center and overseer of the project, insists the timing was pure coincidence – but there is no question the comically unlucky run of weather and backlogged matches over that half-decade propelled the roof issue from a want to a need in the public eye. The benefits for the players, he says, are manifest.The opening of Armstrong marks the end of an expansion that included the retrofitting of a roof above the 22,547-seat Ashe Stadium, the construction of a new 8,125-seat Grandstand, the wonderfully intimate Court\u0026nbsp17 – already a favourite among regulars – and a renovated South Campus that includes 10 rebuilt outer courts.The US Open makes no secret of the sprawling crowds it attracts: more than 700,000 fans generate ticket revenue of over $100m during the two-week tournament, a windfall that has enabled the USTA to finance the project without any public money. Zausner says the addition of evening sessions on Armstrong for the first six days will give them the ability to sell another 6,400 tickets per night, though fan experience remains the priority.“We’re not looking to jam people in here. The goal is solving the crowding issue by creating more space. We put another 12,000 physical seats on the site. You’ve got 4,000 more on Armstrong, you’ve got 2,500 more on Grandstand and then throughout the grounds we put more seats.“So even if we didn’t sell a single additional ticket, there’s just more space for people. But there’s definitely an opportunity for us to get anywhere from 30,000 to maybe as much as 100,000 more people at the tournament.”No one is more enthused about the preservation of Armstrong than John McEnroe, who won all four of his US Open titles there when it was the tournament’s main court.“We weren’t sure what was going to happen,” McEnroe said on Wednesday before taking to the court. “And finally not only did they put this unbelievable roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium but they decided to redesign this court and build this. I know the players are going to be super excited and as a New Yorker and a Queens boy I couldn’t be prouder of this stadium.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f1006071ed930918840d56ebb4b9d503477120c/0_200_5176_3105/master/5176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0c6ab3a9d8ed3434e3ea1486814a372","title":"richard madden webchat post your questions now","story":"The Game of Thrones and Cinderella star is back in Jed Mercurio’s latest thriller, Bodyguard – and here to answer your questionsWhat are your thoughts on more West End shows leaving London: can actors influence that and is there an appetite for it among the acting community?

And I\u0027d love to go back to the Citizens theatre in Glasgow where I first did theatre many years ago. But right now I\u0027m really enjoying acting for camera and working out how to do it better.What’s your favourite question?What would you like to drink?What’s your favourite Pixar film?Inside Out, which I don\u0027t think is suitable for children because it made me weep!I think you and Michelle Fairley had an amazing chemistry on screen as a mother and son duo. Would you like to work with Michelle again?I loved working with Michelle every single day. She\u0027s an outstanding actor and I\u0027d jump at the chance to work with her again.Any idea whether Oasis is ever going to happen?

Photograph: Getty ImagesThe “myth of the drunk Irish man” is probably inaccurate, according to the author of a major international study on alcohol consumption which finds Irish men’s habits comparable to other Europeans.However, it also found that Irish women were found to consume the seventh highest level of “average daily drinks” at 3.1, although this is the only area of alcohol use in which Ireland had a top 10 ranking. The research, published in the Lancet today, also finds there is no safe level of alcohol intake and the healthiest approach is to drink as little as possible, if anything at all.The study said that over a single year, one alcoholic drink a day increases the risk of developing one of 23 related health problems by 0.5 per cent. This rose to 7 per cent for those who had two drinks a day. One drink is defined as being 10g of alcohol.The Global Burden of Disease Study looks at alcohol use and its health affects in 195 countries between 1990 and 2016 and found drinking to be related to 2.8 million deaths each year. “The long-standing myth of the drunk Irish man is likely incorrect,” the study’s lead author Dr Max Griswold, of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, told The . The highest prevalence of male drinkers was in Denmark, Norway, Germany and Argentina, Poland and France. For women, it was in Denmark, Norway, Germany and Argentina. The highest average amounts of daily drinks for men were in Romania (8.2 units), Portugal and Luxembourg (each at 7.2), and Lithuania and Ukraine (both at 7).For women, the highest numbers were found in Ukraine (4.2), and Andorra, Luxembourg and Belarus (all at 3.4). Irish women were in seventh position. It concluded that no level of alcohol is safe as any benefits are offset by negative health implications, particularly the risk of cancers. Alcohol is associated with nearly one in 10 deaths in people aged 15-49, it said. The kinds of negative health impacts the research considers include organ and tissue damage, injuries and poisoning from intoxication, self-harm and violence. The study, which was funded by the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation, used data from 694 studies to estimate how common drinking alcohol is worldwide and 592 studies on associated health risks. “Although the health risks associated with alcohol starts off being small with one drink a day, they then rise rapidly as people drink more,” said Dr Griswold. In global terms, one in three people (or about 2.4 billion people) drink alcohol, including 25 per cent of women and 39 per cent of men. On average, women consumed 0.73 alcoholic drinks per day and men 1.7. For those aged 15-49, alcohol played a role in 3.8 per cent of deaths in women and 12.2 per cent for men. The main causes of deaths were tuberculosis (1.4 per cent), road injuries (1.2 per cent), and self-harm (1.1 per cent). For those aged 50 and older, cancer constituted 27.1 per cent of alcohol-related deaths in women and 18.9 per cent in men."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Importing clergy from abroad will not provide a proper solution, says Fr Bernard CotterAbuse victims \u0026lsquodon\u0026rsquot need a letter from the pope to know this is a reality\u0026rsquo, says survivor Marie CollinsBroadcaster will discuss disappearance of HMS Erebus during an expedition to find Northwest PassageSir Nicholas Fenn said it had been sobering to see British ignorance and prejudice from the Irish end of the telescope\u0026lsquoCuban ambassador gave an almost incomprehensible speech about international solidarity and the class struggle\u0026rsquo said embassy officialNorthern Ireland Office archive papers reveal British ambassador\u0026rsquos insights on Irish political developments in the early 1990sThe leading Irish Catholic charity to withdraw investment in oil companies to fight climate changeGarda investigation after 44-year-old man dies following fire at house in TerenureResidents and firms express fears over effect of traffic restrictionsCouncil chief says spaces are reserved outside capital during papal visit \u0026lsquojust in case\u0026rsquoVictim was taken to hospital for injuries which have been described as seriousGarda\u0026iacute investigating after one man injured in Tullamore stabbing on Thursday nightMajor report on alcohol consumption finds Irish habits are similar to other EuropeansBrexit proposal comes as Michel Barnier warns of need to \u0026lsquode-dramatise\u0026rsquo backstop issueDeclassified files from the Northern Ireland Office reveal efforts to block the proposalNorthern party leaders line up to criticise no-deal scenarios outlined by Dominic RaabThe year saw assassinations, the Warrington bombs, and Hume-Adams dialogueFast food firm disowns faked submissions backing its planned service area near Ennis"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3605867.1535104004!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ni customs checks would take place in britain under new plans","story":"Britain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab outlines the British government’s ambitions for a no-deal Brexit.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has said the British government is committed to safeguarding the Belfast Agreement and avoiding a hard Border. Photograph: Luke MacGregorBloombergChecks on goods travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland would be carried out at British ports under fresh ideas to make the so-called backstop easier to agree.The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU and UK need to “de-dramatise” the backstop, which commits both to ensuring there is no hard Border even if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal.The  understands that, under new ideas, customs and regulatory checks would be located in Britain rather than Northern Ireland.Although scepticism still remains that such an approach could be acceptable to the UK, senior sources said agreement could be reached if there is “political will” in London.“Can we find a way of operating the backstop that is less incendiary politically?” asked one. “You don’t want EU customs officers in Larne and Belfast. Could you do it somewhere else?” It is also suggested that checks could be low-profile in nature and carried out by private contractors. “You could find a way to do it where you don’t have people wearing EU uniforms.” Although committing to the principle of the backstop, the UK has rejected the EU’s interpretation of it.The EU proposal means Northern Ireland remaining in the single market and customs union. British prime minister Theresa May and the DUP, on whose support she relies, say it would split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK. The backstop is one of the main stumbling blocks to a withdrawal agreement being reached later this year. There is an acceptance in Dublin that the October deadline for the agreement will now be missed, with November seen as more realistic.Efforts to make the backstop more palatable are currently being “tossed around”, but it is stressed that no specific proposals have been tabled in negotiations. The lack of alternatives coming from the UK has meant the EU is attempting to make its proposal more politically acceptable.“The North could have the best of both worlds,” a senior Government source said. “It could have access to the EU and UK markets. On freedom of travel, that is already there. We are going to maintain the Common Travel Area.”Checks would only be needed on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the UK, and not the other way around, because of the prospect of them entering the EU single market through the Irish Republic.On Thursday, the British government said it will seek to negotiate a special arrangement for North-South trade to ensure that the Border remains open even in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But trade between the Republic and the rest of the UK could be subject to the same bureaucratic arrangements facing other member states.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said the British government would maintain its commitment to keeping the Border open regardless of the outcome of Brexit negotiations, but he refused to rule out differentiated arrangements for Irish firms trading with the rest of the UK.“We’re saying very loud and clear that we will not allow anything to disrupt the terms of the Belfast agreement and that we wouldn’t return to any form of hard border,” he said. “I’m not quite sure what it would look like so I’m not going to hypothetically rule it in or out.”Mr Raab was speaking after the publication of 25 technical notices outlining the impact of a no-deal Brexit on different sectors and economic activities. A number of the notices, including those on trade, tariffs and the cross-border movement of medicines, medical devices, blood and human organs, suggest that special arrangements may be required for Northern Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Colman Doyle Among this year’s releases from Belfast from the early 1990s are files containing despatches from the British embassy in Dublin on the Irish political situation and, in particular, the last days of Charles Haughey’s premiership.  The files contain details of a discussion between the British ambassador and Dermot Nally (secretary to the Government) on March 2nd, 1992. Nally declared himself unclear on Reynolds’s views on Northern Ireland. The new taoiseach, he said, “believed that the EC context might be a help in moving towards a solution in that it would allow relationships to be re-defined, NorthSouth and EastWest.” By encouraging co-operation along these lines, Reynolds told him, it might be possible “to bypass the politicians in the North who were stuck in old moulds . . . As a businessman, he expected problems to have solutions”.  Nally informed Blatherwick that John Hume and other SDLP leaders had seen the taoiseach that morning. It had been a good meeting. “No Taoiseach could disregard the SDLP and he expected the Taoiseach to echo that.” Reynolds had also “looked for encouraging signs from the Sinn Féin conference in Dublin on 22 February, but found none”.

Photograph: EPALuke MacGregor  POOLThe British government has told pharmaceutical companies to stockpile an extra six weeks supply of medicines to prepare for a no-deal Brexit and warned that businesses will face new bureaucratic hurdles when they import and export goods.Twenty-five technical notices published on Thursday outlined the impact of a no-deal Brexit on a number of sectors and economic activities but Brexit secretary Dominic Raab stressed that London remained confident of reaching an agreement with the EU.“I am still confident that getting a good deal is, by far, the most likely outcome. The vast majority, roughly 80 per cent, of the withdrawal agreement has now been agreed, and we are making further progress on those outstanding separation issues,” he said.The technical notices, the first batch of a total of 84, warned that failure to reach a deal with Brussels would make credit card transactions with the EU more expensive for British consumers. And British citizens living in the EU could be unable to access their UK bank accounts or pensions without an agreement on financial services.The notice on trade tells businesses importing goods from the EU that they will have to register as importers and decide the correct classification and value of their goods and enter it on a customs declaration for the revenue and customs service (HMRC).They should “consider how they will submit import declarations, including whether to engage a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider (businesses that want to do this themselves will need to acquire the appropriate software and secure the necessary authorisations from HMRC). Engaging a customs broker or acquiring the appropriate software and authorisations form HMRC will come at a cost”.Britain would continue to accept medicines tested in EU member states and Mr Raab said he would expect the EU to act with similar “good faith” and flexibility even without a Brexit deal.“Most of the worst-case scenarios, being bandied around, imply that the EU would resist all and any mutual co-operation with the UK. In reality, I find it difficult to imagine that our EU partners would not want to co-operate with us even in that scenario in key areas like this, given the obvious mutual benefits involved,” he said.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the technical notices and Mr Raab’s speech showed that the government was not prepared for a no-deal Brexit.“We are eight weeks out from the deadline for reaching an agreement. Ministers should be getting on the job of negotiating a Brexit deal that works for Britain, not publishing vague documents that will convince no one. A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the Government’s negotiating strategy,” he said.The Confederation of British Industry said the notices exposed Brexiteers’ claims about the ease of leaving the EU on “World Trade Organisation terms” as a fantasy. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, said they confirmed that a no-deal Brexit was not a credible option.“It would be devastating for working people. Jobs and rights at work would be under threat, and price increases would hit already-struggling families hard. The government cannot allow us to crash out. The prime minister must throw out her red lines, face down the extremists in her party, and negotiate a deal that works for the whole of the UK,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

weather britain braces wet windy weekend","story":"Wet weather in Mousehole, Cornwall, on Friday morningHaving basked in glorious sunshine in recent months, Britain is bracing itself for a wet and windy August bank holiday weekend. Sun lovers have been spoilt this year with temperatures regularly soaring to 30C and above in one of the hottest and driest summers on record.  Traditionally, the final bank holiday in August is when families scramble to get away seeking the final rays of sunshine before children return to school. But getaways could be scuppered by travel disruption as the warm weather turns to wind and rain over the weekend.Maximum temperatures are set to plunge into the high teens by Sunday, with parts of the country expected to be battered by near gale-force winds.Drivers are being warned to expect delays as more than 14 million cars take to the roads for leisure trips between Thursday and Monday, according to the RAC.Met Office meteorologist Simon Partridge said wet and windy weather could cause further trouble for those travelling over the last long weekend before the festive period.In places we are quite likely to see some standing water on the roads which will add to the difficult driving conditions on Sunday, he said.Some areas could see winds of between 30mph to 40mph, so a wet and windy day.Traffic information supplier Inrix predicted that the most delayed route will be the M5 from junction four to junction one in the West Midlands between 1pm and 6pm on Friday, when journeys with a typical travel time of 21 minutes could take an extra hour.On Saturday the M1 is predicted to be badly affected from junction 22 to junction 25 in the East Midlands, with typical journey times increasing from 16 minutes to 62 minutes.Motorists\u0027 frustrations with the congestion could be heightened by the knowledge that fuel prices stand at a four-year high, with Government figures showing the average cost of a litre of petrol is £1.29, while diesel is £1.33.Engineering work on the railways means a number of routes are disrupted.Network Rail is urging passengers not to travel on the West Coast Main Line to and from London between Saturday and Monday as London Euston is closed.People who do travel between north-west England and the capital risk journeys that are far longer, busier and less comfortable than normal, the Government-owned company warned.June saw the hottest weather since 1940, and least rainfall in 23 yearsLondon Euston, the UK\u0027s fifth busiest station, will also be closed during the following weekend, as work to replace a junction in Wembley continues.Network Rail route managing director Martin Frobisher said: There is never an ideal time to shut the railway but these weekends are the least disruptive times to do it.Engineering work will also disrupt some services to Manchester, Birmingham International and Derby.Blustery showers in the north and west will move south-east on Friday, bringing a cool night for the UK, with some grass frost in Scotland on Saturday morning.Sunny spells and scattered showers will follow for many, with temperatures expected to reach around 20C (68F).The mercury is set to dip to a maximum of between 17C (62.6F) and 19C (66.2F) on Sunday as heavy rain moves across the whole of the UK from the west.Monday, which is a bank holiday in all the home nations except Scotland, will see conditions improve, with bright and breezy weather as well as a few scattered showers.Please review our commenting policyBritish couple \u0026#39fit and healthy\u0026#39 before deaths on Thomas

We also look at reader responses to Nigel Farage\u0027s claims that it was a blessing that he was never elected as an MP and who you think should be the next leader of the Conservative Party.WTO rules would be much more painful than Brexiteers let onMonckton Chambers QC, George Peretz wrote for the  this week warning about the pain that WTO rules could cause the UK. He claims that WTO dispute resolution mechanisms are slow and that there is a serious enforcement issue. Our readers mostly disagreed with Mr Peretz\u0027s comments, and argued that in the end it\u0027s about mutual self-interest for the EU and that Brexit will likely bring more jobs to the UK.\u0027The driver for the solution will be mutual self interest\u0027\u0027It\u0027s easy to be legalistic about the no-deal scenario. The issue of course is that this is a political problem and the resolution will be political. The driver for the solution will be mutual self interest. \u0027If planes can\u0027t fly out they also can\u0027t fly in. The European airlines use British airspace to fly to and from the US. The EU countries want to continue to market in the UK. Foreign nationals live and work here. If the EU decides to be difficult they have to balance this with likely reactions from an aggrieved ex-partner. An accommodation, albeit temporary, will be found to keep the machine working until a more comprehensive air traffic services agreement is put in place.\u0027\u0027Brexit is really going to be a jobs bonanza\u0027\u0027There were 2.5 million new car registrations in the U.K. last year, whilst Nissan built half a million cars. Clearly, the UK market is not small - it is five times larger than Nissan’s entire Sunderland output. Toyota and Honda made another 300,000 cars in the UK between them.\u0027I’d be very happy picking cars from those three companies alone, without having to risk JLR.\u0027Last year, 44pc of British car components were made in the UK. Nissan has asked for 100 million pounds to relocate the remainder of the European supply chains to the North East.\u0027Sounds like a bargain to me. We should take it off the 39 billion we won’t be paying them for ‘no-deal’. If Europe delays parts, we move factories from Europe to the North east and midlands. Great.\u0027The problem is time. We should have declared for WTO a year ago, allowing car manufacturers to build those chains and put temporary alternative supply chains from the rest of the world in place.\u0027A temporary solution of importing parts from the Far East whilst taking 18 months to build UK supply chains for all UK car manufacturers and their 1.7 million models currently produced is sensible.\u0027Brexit is really going to be a jobs bonanza.\u0027Nigel Farage: \u0027It’s a blessing I was never elected as an MP... Now I can help save Brexit\u0027In an exclusive video for the  this week, Nigel Farage branded Conservative leader Theresa May as the “worst leader” he has seen in a lifetime. We asked readers to send in their questions in response to a comment piece Mr Farage wrote for the  this week where he announced his return to frontline politics.Some readers were encouraged by his bullish responses while others were left to ponder whether he really did make UKIP what it is today.\u0027Farage is more likely to put many undecided people off\u0027\u0027It would be better if Matthew Elliot and Dominic Cummings were restarting vote leave. Farage speaks to a paternalistic, protectionist, nationalism and is more likely to put many undecided people off. \u0027He\u0027s also more likely to make the government dig their heels in and do the opposite of what he wants.\u0027\u0027The architect of Brexit should see it through\u0027\u0027It\u0027s quite fitting that the architect of Brexit should see it through to a successful conclusion.\u0027\u0027He wasn\u0027t the man who made UKIPl Robert Kilroy-Silk was\u0027\u0027I personally don\u0027t rate Farage. For a man who has spent his entire political life campaigning for Brexit, he has never formulated his desired political and economic exit scenario. It\u0027s always been what others could and should do. And he wasn\u0027t the man who made UKIP Robert Kilroy-Silk was.\u0027After the news that Danny Boyle won\u0027t be directing the latest Bond film, The \u0027s film critic Danny Roby wrote this week that it\u0027s actually the film\u0027s producers that are holding Bond back. He muses over whether it was over creative differences or box office fatigue from previous Bond films, Skyfall and Spectre.Danny Boyle will not be directing the next James Bond film Our readers shared their thoughts on the latest saga:\u0027They won\u0027t accept anything that might endanger the winning formula they now have\u0027\u0027Bond films have been good, bad and indifferent, but since Daniel Craig took the job as Bond, the franchise has lifted itself into the higher echelons and can be classed now as very entertaining. \u0027Whatever the recipe, it\u0027s currently working very well and no doubt creating huge returns for the studios. They won\u0027t accept anything that might endanger the winning formula they now have. You can\u0027t blame them.\u0027\u0027Kenneth Branagh might be a good shout as the next director\u0027\u0027I don\u0027t think the producers are risk averse.  The last 4 bond films have a neat story arc which I cannot recall earlier Bond movies attempting. Kenneth Branagh might be a good shout as the next director.\u0027No-deal Brexit plans: Online shoppers and holidaymakers face higher credit card feesThis week, The government published 25 technical notices in preparation for a no deal aimed at helping businesses and the public to prepare. A notable detail included within the report is that holidaymakers and online shoppers will face higher credit card fees when purchasing goods from the European Union.Our readers expressed mixed reactions to the news.  \u0027Why are we bothering to worry about such trivia?\u0027\u0027Any extra charges are a pittance in the grand scheme of things.\u0027Why are we bothering to worry about such trivia when there are so many far more important things to get on with?\u0027\u0027It\u0027s irritating, but no more than that\u0027\u0027Of course. When all these guidelines are issued it will be an impressive stack of paper. But an inidual business will only be dealing with a tiny fragment of these regulations - the ones pertinent to their own operation.\u0027It\u0027s irritating, but no more than that.\u002711 things America has pinched from us and made worseFrom food recipes and movies to music and fashion, trends and popular entertainment have crossed between the Atlantic seamlessly for countless decades.

Jacob Rees-Mogg,  the Conservative MP representing North East Somerset, has noted in a letter sent to Conservative Associates that the Prime Minister’s Brexit proposals “would shackle us forever.” This subsequently casts questions over who could succeed Mrs May if she was replaced.Our readers have voiced their opinions, with Boris Johnson topping our poll. You can take it here.\u0027Boris is one of the few that have been able to articulate a positive post-Brexit future\u0027\u0027Boris. It can only be Boris.\u0027I can see David Davis taking over as interim PM until Brexit is over, but Boris is one of very few that have been able to articulate a positive and engaging post-Brexit future for the UK.\u0027A committed Government of leavers who are absolutely dedicated to Britain carving itself out a new independent future is desperately needed.\u0027\u0027Andrea Leadsom would do a good job, too\u0027For me, it would have to be either Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson, although I believe Andrea Leadsom would do a very good job, too.\u0027It\u0027s a racing certainty that the Tories will continue their rush towards suicide and pick Sajid Javid\u0027To the question who should be leader, I answered Boris Johnson. To the question of who will be leader, I think it\u0027s a racing certainty that the Tories will continue their rush towards suicide and pick Javid.

Now its more like two thirds in homes, and its men and women equally, by and large,” he said. “The problem is that parity in terms of drinking means a lot more harm,” he said.  Women aged 45 to 64 are the most likely of any age group to drink, separate figures show. The new study, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, found one drink a day was found to increase the risk of developing one of 23 alcohol-related health problems by  0.5 per cent. Two drinks a day meant a 7 per cent increased risk, compared with those who were teetotal, soaring to 37 per cent  risk for for those downing five drinks daily.10 ways to change your drinking habitsDr James Nicholls, director of research and policy development, from Alcohol Concern and Alcohol Research UK, said the trends were fuelling an “alarming” rise in cases of liver disase among women. “We are seeing a lot of women who started going out in the 1980s or 1990s who are now in middle age but their drinking habits haven’t changed much. That is storing up really worrying rates of liver disease,” he said. Few countries saw trends similar to those in the UK, though in Sweden, women are drinking more than men, with 3.1 drinks a day for women, compared with 2.7 for men. The standard measure used per drink was 10 grams of pure alcohol -  a 100 ml glass of 13 per cent wine, or a 375 ml bottle of beer, at 3.5 per cent strength.Please review our commenting policyBritish couple \u0026#39fit and healthy\u0026#39 before deaths on Thomas Cook holiday as 300 evacuated from Egyptian hotelRHS reveals ‘unusual fruit’ is sprouting across Britain due to heatwaveSpellbound: inside the spookiest exhibition of the yearFrom Brexit to James Bond: Our readers respond to this week\u0026#39s top storiesGrieving father lost son to DNP diet pills that kill five men in six monthsRyanair charge shake-up means fliers will pay for light luggageEverything you need to know about Ryanair\u0026#39s controversial new baggage rulesBank holiday weather: Britain braces for wet and windy weekendItaly mulls massive tax break to lure retirees, including Britons, to its sun-soaked southern regionsNicola Sturgeon says allegations of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond could not be \u0026#39swept under the carpet\u0026#39Ryanair charge shake-up means fliers will pay for light luggageFrom Holly Willoughby to Piers Morgan: who could replace Ant McPartlin as I\u0026#39m A Celeb host? Jeremy Corbyn praised by Nick Griffin and former KKK leader after \u0026#39British Zionists don\u0026#39t understand English irony\u0026#39 commentsTrudeau voices concern over Saudi death penalty for rights activist amid diplomatic standoffScott Morrison named new Australian prime minister as Malcolm Turnbull ousted How popular is Donald Trump?

The FTSE dipped in early trading, while Asian markets also nudged down overnight, after negotiations concluded with no results.

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter

She lives on the Isle of Man and works as a pub manager.She says: I used to work in one of the island’s poshest hotels. We’d get British celebs like David Tennant staying all the time.They were easy to deal with and normally they checked in to chill out.But during the Isle of Man motorbike racing the high flyers would arrive.In the hotel we’d regularly see strippers strutting around offering private dances and other services to the guests.One well-to-do couple checked out looking prim and proper, but when my colleague opened the room to their bedroom it turned out theyd had a crazy sex party.They’d left behind huge dildos and filthy bedding.Dirty weekends are routine. There was one guy who had a suite on permanent reservation and had a carousel of different women coming to stay with him.Guests regularly chat up the staff, and some would think nothing of manhandling us either.One famous older man pinched my bum when I was serving him. As soon as my hands were free I hit him with my tray.Deaths do happen though. One nasty incident involved an elderly guy who was staying for the TT motorbike race.His intestines had exploded and he haemorrhaged out in the room.The stench was awful - you could smell it along the corridor.The room was like a scene from a Quentin Tarrantino film with blood on the carpet, the bed and up the walls.You just have to clean it up as quickly as possible so the room is ready to rent again.Hotel receptionist Anna Thistlethwaite, 31 is a married mum of one who lives in Cambridge.She says: I have worked in the hotel industry for three years as front of house at a 4-star hotel in Hertfordshire.A common occurrence at weddings is for couples to go to their rooms - then when the bride passes out drunk the  groom goes and has sex with someone else.He’ll even go back and check his new wife is still asleep before returning to the woman in the other room. It happens a lot.We catch the blokes out because they always mix up the key cards.We make them wait at reception for as long as possible to reissue them with one for their room.One guest would check in every Friday night, pay for his room in cash and refuse to give any contact details.Forty-five minutes later a woman would literally run across the lobby and head towards his room.It was obvious he was cheating on his wife but we couldn’t work out if she was a prostitute or his mistress.We routinely see businessmen come in with different women during conference weeks.The wife normally joins them at the end none the wiser to what he has been up to.We have to keep a straight face and remember that the customer is always right.Josh Tully, 27, is general manager of La Vue France, boutique hotel \u0026amp wedding venue in southwest France. He says: I used to work for an upscale UK establishment which was the destination for the rich and famous.One A-list Hollywood star flew in to give the bride away at her wedding.It was raining lightly and he refused to walk outside in case he ruined his Louis Vuitton suede loafers so we had to ensure there was a buggy available at all times to take him to and from the church and hotel.Anyone would have thought he was the bride.Another time, a guest who had reserved in advance asked us to ensure we had a £500 bottle of vintage Krug champagne on ice for his arrival.Our supplier let us down on the morning – so we improvised.We presented him with a bottle of the £20 house champagne and he was none the wiser.He thanked us for going to the trouble of getting it in and even explained how you could taste the difference.We kept a straight face and took the compliment.Other famous guests included a boy band who stayed to write songs.One of them had a fish only diet - each meal was fish guts, fish oil and fish blood whizzed up in a blender - It smelled disgusting.Yet we all had to go along with it and tell him how amazing he looked as a result of knocking back the revolting shots.One thing Ive learned is that people always seem to get frisky when they go away for the weekend.Once I walked into the games room only to find a couple having sex under the snooker table.They saw me but made the decision to carry on, so I left them to it.They just nodded at me when they eventually walked out.Maria Andrews, 29, lives in Northolt and is a married mum-of-one.She says: I worked in a 4-star hotel for the last five years. Nothing anyone does surprises me any more. I have delivered room service to a man who opened the door completely naked.I walked in and put the tray of two beers and some nibbles on the table. He wandered towards me. I didnt notice he was starker’s until I asked him to sign the bill.As I stood up his willy came into view. It was enormous - I can only assume he wanted to show it off.His wife was in bathtub next door also naked.Neither of them were drunk but - they were just blatant exhibitionists.Then there was the time a woman came downstairs in the middle of the night completely naked.She said shes got locked out after mistaking her room door for bathroom one.We didn’t believe a word of it. We suspect she got caught with someone she shouldn’t have been with and had to scarper.She had to stand at reception starkers while we ran her identity through the system.She had a great body which was just as well as the entire hotel staff saw the security footage of her streaking along the corridors.People behave badly from the moment they check in. I would never go back to the hotel industry. We were treated like sh*t.One man came in to the hotel to use the wifi. When we asked him to leave, he started threatening one of my colleagues with a glass bottle.I jumped on him and pinned him to the floor. It was just as well the police arrived because he was starting to choke.Guests also always assume if it isn’t nailed down then they can pinch it.After one wedding I clocked a woman trying to walk out with several 3-foot high centrepiece hidden under her coat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A third of its ten million population are in poverty. One in five cannot afford electricity or rent.Forty per cent of young people are jobless. Many in work earn half what they did ten years ago.Hundreds of thousands of Greece’s brightest have fled.The Eurozone works nicely for Germany . . . but that’s it. Thank God we never signed up to it.Brexit Anxiety Disorder is real, two top psychologists believe. It certainly explains the gibbering hallucinations of Andrew Adonis and his mates.Two grievous losses tipped this complacent Remoaner elite over the edge:The control over our national direction to which they always felt entitled. And our departure from the corrupt, bullying, protectionist EU club they bizarrely consider a beacon of liberal values.Their latest co-ordinated ruse — backed by rich celebrities, has-been politicians and former newspapers — is to pretend a second referendum would “bring a divided Britain together”.They are actually arguing that after two years of abusing 17.4million Leavers as thick racists, Remainers now deserve a second chance to get what they wanted. And that, whatever the result, we would all magically unite behind it.If there’s a more laughably mad contention, we haven’t heard it.We might once have wondered what they were smoking.

Routine use of drugs and synthetic highs, brazenly dropped by drones flown in by crime gangs.It’s not about whether prisons are run by the private or public sector. Too many of both are in a parlous state. Cuts have bitten too deeply — and the Government has just hoped for the best.It cannot go on.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in? Where people never mix and never try to empathise with those who have had different life experiences to theirs?We should stand up for cultural ­appropriation.The global intermingling of food and fashion and art has enriched human life.As the great American novelist Lionel Shriver reminds us: “People with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.”Yet in their Brave New World, everyone would stick to their own people and their own ways.

They both agreed: too much soy sauce, but otherwise delicious.Last month Gwen van der Zwan, from the Netherlands, tried cannibalism for the first time.However, shes no Hannibal Lecter and no humans were hurt in the making of her dinner.Instead, she made the meal from her own blood - which she had painstakingly drained into a medical bag that day - after becoming fascinated with the idea of trying a human sausage.Why is my idea considered disgusting, but doing the same thing with pigs blood isnt? she asked at the time.Although shes rare in acting publicly on her unusual tastes, Gwen is far from the only one to be fascinated by cannibalism.Dating-style fetish sites match up those desperate for human flesh with those who want nothing more than to be eaten alive themselves.Cannibal seeks meal, one post reads. This 37 year old male seeks a nice cute piece of meat. I prefer girls.Another says: Im a thirty-something man looking for a female so we can sample each others flesh. Cut together, cook together, and eat together. Non-lethal cuts so we can enjoy eating one another.Would-be victims refer to themselves as longpigs - a term meaning human flesh which was used by man-eating Pacific islanders who thought people tasted like pork.But why would anyone want to eat, or be eaten by, someone else?Experts say that cannibalism is largely to do with power - breaking the ultimate taboo leaves man-eaters feeling euphoric.Therapist Karen Hylen has even suggested that cannibalism can become addictive for a small number of people with psychopathic tendencies, comparing the act of eating someone to a cocaine high.On Reddit, a growing number of posters chat openly about their fascination with cannibalism, although comments seem to often be driven more by a morbid curiosity than anything else.Bill Schutt, author of Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History, ate a human placenta when writing his book.He told Sun Online: We think cannibalism is revolting because thats what our culture dictates. Other cultures that didn’t get that memo have had very different attitudes toward cannibalism. For example, in the mid-20th century, the Wari people of Brazil were apparently just as upset to find that Western anthropologists buried their dead as the anthropologists were aghast to learn that the Wari ate their loved ones after they died.In June, a 38-year-old man took to Reddit to share the story (verified by Vice) of a dinner party where his friends tucked into a meal made from his amputated foot.After a motorbike accident in 2016, he had the smashed limb cut off - and doctors let him keep it.Then, three weeks later, he threw a brunch for ten willing friends where the main course was tacos made from the flesh which had been amputated.The anonymous man posted photos of the dish, and explained how he kept his mangled foot in the freezer until it was time to cook it.Then he cut out a chunk of flesh, marinated it overnight and sauteed it with onions, peppers and lime juice.Posting on Reddit, he says: I taste like buffalo. But chewier. Super beefy and a little fat. We werent looking to go all Hannibal and get gourmet - just to make it so no one gagged.My friends and I always had this joke, he adds. If you could try human flesh in an ethical and healthy way, would you? And we always said of course. Well the opportunity came up and I called them on it.It was a neat experience, and I wouldnt change it.As Nottingham Trent legal expert Samantha Pegg tells Sun Online: Cannibalism itself is not a crime.Obviously if you kill someone to eat them then the appropriate offence would be murder. There could be liability for unlawfully preventing a burial or outraging public decency if a desecrated body was publicly exposed or eaten in public.But we couldnt criminalise the eating of human flesh as most of us consume bits of our own bodies, like nibbling your own fingers for example.So although eating human flesh isnt strictly illegal, consenting cannibal arrangements can stray into dark territory.Samantha says: The law sets limits on what you can lawfully consent to. So, for example, you couldnt consent to someone chopping off your finger to consume it.In the UK you certainly couldnt consent to being killed to be eaten.Where we have seen cases of cannibalism in English law these have been charged as murder.In Gwens case, it all started because she had been thinking about how her friends would react if she really made a dish from her own bodily fluid - so last month she got online and ordered a set of needles and a blood bag.A couple of days and a few YouTube tutorials later, she punctured the skin on the inside of her elbow and started filling a bag with half a litre of her blood.Listening to the sounds of blood splashing into the bag, Gwen wondered: What would my mom think if she saw me sitting in my living room like this?Once she had extracted half a litre of her own blood from her now weak and purple-looking arm, she removed the needle - accidentally squirting a few droplets onto the carpet.Then, with the help of a close, not-too-squeamish friend, Gwen mixed lentils, tomato puree, soy sauce, and herbs into a filling and sloshed in almost the entire bag of blood.The kitchen looked like a slaughterhouse, she jokes in a Munchies article.Amazingly, many of Gwens friends were eager to try her creation, which she served up, MasterChef style, on white plates with a bloody jus.We cut happily into the sausages and chewed on them as if we were judges on a cooking show, she writes.The texture was very good and the level of spiciness was perfect. Unfortunately I went a bit heavy on the soy sauce, so the sausage is a bit salty. Not bad, though.However, not all would-be cannibals are so easily satisfied with just a bite of blood sausage.An alarming number of online posts feature requests for victims willing to be eaten alive to satisfy cannibalistic sexual desires.The forum which hosts hundreds of these posts is the evolution of Cannibal Cafe, a now-defunct website for cannibals seeking the same.Supposedly, the message board is for fetishists who want to role play as man-eaters, but we know from a high-profile case on Cannibal Cafe that some users were deadly serious about eating someone they met online.German IT technician Armin Meiwes was among the unknown number of legitimate cannibals lurking on the site.In the most notorious case of cannibalism this century, he posted: looking for a well-built 18 to 30-year-old to be slaughtered and then consumed.Bernd Jürgen Armando Brandes, an engineer from Berlin, answered his advert in March 2001, stating that he was willing to be killed and eaten.A few days later, the pair met in Meiwes home in the small town of Rotenburg and filmed a video where Meiwes cut off and ate Brandes penis, with his consent.As Brandes bled to death, Meiwes fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine and garlic.He later stabbed his victim the throat and hung his body on the meat hook.He ate the remains over the following ten months, hiding body parts in his freezer and eating up to 44 pounds of human flesh - all for the supposed sexual pleasure of it.The cannibal wasnt arrested until 2002, when another ad he posted online was brought to the attention of the authorities.Even though his victim had agreed to being killed and eaten, he was eventually convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.Today, Meiwes is a vegetarian and says he regrets his crime, but he estimates that there could still be as many as 800 active cannibals in Germany alone.As for the number of cannibals elsewhere, experts say its impossible to guess.But new posts pop up on the cannibal forum every day, and based on the chatter online it seems like the appetite for these dark and unconventional tastes is only growing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools. That’s our future, that’s who we will be.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quite the reverse.

Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance. His apparent sole motivation being revenge after his lust for Germanic sado-masochistic hooker orgies was exposed.This, then, is the rancid state of Labour:A cesspit of a party, run by public schoolboy Marxist class warriors, infested with anti-Semitic racism and funded by one of the most unimaginably unpleasant individuals in public life.How proud its MPs must be.IT’S far too easy for banks to blame ­customers conned out of their savings.Most of us are still too savvy to give our details to cold-callers or emailers.

The couple own other properties too.Baroness Shami ChakrabatiThe shadow attorney general and has said that she is against the reintroduction of grammar schools because they “segregate” young children.But it was revealed her 13-year-old son was admitted to the selective Dulwich College, which charges fees of £18,000 a year.Speaking to ITV she denied being a hypocrite, saying: “I live a charmed and privileged life, much more now than I ever did when I was a child, but people on the Left have often had charmed and privileged lives.“I live in a nice big house, and eat nice food, and my neighbours are homeless, and go to food banks.And not forgetting... Jeremy CorbynThe Labour boss grew up in leafy villages and large houses including the seven-bedroom Yew Tree Manor in Chetwynd - once part of an estate owned by the Duke of Sunderland.According to Rosa Prince, Mr Corbyns biographer, he enjoyed a thoroughly upper-middle-class, scruffy country upbringing.He attended Castle House Prep school and then a grammar - before going travelling around Jamaica and Latin America in a fashion similar to todays gap yearsI think there can only be one reason why he is doing this, which is to create an atmosphere of resentment and prejudice, to presumably suit his political purposes.Bob Seely MP described Mr Corbyns team as a bunch of posh Marxists.But there are others in his team who come from more down to earth backgrounds.Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner left school when she got pregnant, and went on to work as a care worker.Rebecca Long-Bailey, who grew up in Old Trafford, began her working life in a pawn shop, and also worked in call centres, a furniture factory and as a postwoman before she went on to become a solicitor. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Girls continued to do better than boys, but the gap has closed. ­Nearly one in four girls got a grade 7, compared with one in six lads.But the new system was dubbed a waste of time and resources as GCSEs no longer meant much as far as employers were concerned.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, questioned the cost in hours, stress and money of exams at 16, “when for employers, it’s what they get at 18 that’s important?”A PROFOUNDLY deaf student who got a clean sweep of top grades in her GCSEs said her impairment pushed her to work harder and she refused to let it define her.Lily Olliver sees herself as just an “ordinary girl who happens to be deaf”.The 16-year-old, of Hove, achieved 10 9s and the top mark of an A hat - the equivalent of an A** - in further maths.Last year her sister Jessica, who is also deaf, gained eight A*s at GCSE as well as two As and a B, a 7 and a 6 at the school.Lily, who sits on the youth advisory board for the National Deaf Children’s Society, said: “I’m in shock, I’m really pleased. It’s a relief.“I was really worried about religious studies and additional maths.A GIRL from Portugal has achieved top GCSE results after learning English by watching Netflix.Vitoria Mario, 16, barely spoke a word of English when she arrived in the country two years ago.But yesterday she was celebrating two grade 8s in English, as well as 9s in maths and Spanish.Vitoria, of Stratford, East London, was hooked on dramas Power and Blindspot. She said: “I watched a lot of Netflix.”“I don’t think being deaf should stop you in anything you feel you want to do.“I don’t want it to define me.“If anything it caused me to work a bit harder and fight a bit more.”She plans to return to Brighton College for A-levels and is hoping to study a combination of chemistry, biology, maths, further maths and philosophy but is still deciding exactly which subjects to pick.She said she is also exploring ideas for her career.Her parents Pam and Andy Olliver said they were so proud of their “little girl”.A tearful Mrs Olliver added: “Lilly is profoundly deaf but she is pretty steely.“She did really well and had to work very hard.PE teacher James Riley, 41, opened his results with his class live in front of the cameras on ITV’s Good Morning Britain.The Head of Year 11 at Furness Academy in Cumbria revealed he had sat the paper to discover how hard the new exam was.His grade is equal to a C under the old system.“What she’s keen to say is she’s just an ordinary person who happens to be deaf. It’s how we raised them.”Teen chess genius Dominic Miller, of Littlehampton, West Sussex, who secured a place at the school aged 13 when he won its first ever chess scholarship, achieved nine 9s, A*s in German and computing and an A hat in further maths.He won the backing of one of the UK’s best chess players, grandmaster Nigel Short, to take his place at the school and has hopes of becoming a grandmaster himself.Out of the 732 students across the country who received seven grade 9s or above, 34 studied at Brighton College, the school said.There were 10 students who achieved at least nine 9s at the school with one getting the highest he possibly could in all exams - eight nines, an A hat and two A*s.Some 89.6% of all grades were the highest - 7,8 and 9 or the equivalent in the existing marking pattern - taking into account all exams sat under the new grading system and the existing structure, the school said.It added that 90.9 per cent of girls and 88.8 per cent of boys achieved grade 7 or higher.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

prime minister in less than 10 years, emerged victorious from a three-way race with former home affairs minister Peter Dutton and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.Turnbull, who opted not to contest the vote, is the fourth PM to be dumped by their own party before serving a full three-year term since 2010.The leadership battle was sparked on Tuesday by an unsuccessful challenge by Dutton, who narrowly lost a vote against Turnbull.Under intense pressure to call a second vote, Turnbull convened a party meeting after receiving a letter signed by the majority of party members calling for a change of leader.Morrison defeated the key challenger Peter Dutton, a former Cabinet minister, by a vote 45-40.Turnbull said before the ballot that if he lost hed quit parliament, leaving the new government facing a by-election for his Sydney seat that could see it lose its one-seat majority.Australian media reported that foreign minister Bishop, having been defeated in the leadership ballot, would likely also resign from politics.Turnbull came to power in a party-room coup in September 2015.A social liberal and multi-millionaire former merchant banker, he has struggled to appeal to conservative voters and only narrowly won a general election in 2016.The Liberal party is the senior partner in the ruling conservative coalition.The Liberal-National government has consistently trailed the opposition Labor party in opinion polls.If Turnbull resigns from parliament, he would leave the new government facing a by-election for his Sydney seat that could see it lose its one-seat

Can you hear me at the back? My name is Dominic Raab and I am your stewardess on this flight with Brexit Airways. As you will have been aware at the time you bought your tickets, or in the case of 48% of you were marched at gunpoint on to the plane, our original destination was the Sunlit Uplands of 1974, where we could once again enjoy a 3-day week, a state of emergency in Northern Ireland, and fascists marching in the streets.  Due to unforeseen circumstances entirely within our control but sadly not explained in the literature available to you on the clown bus that drove you to the airport, our pilot Theresa has had to alter our destination. She thinks we\u0027re headed for the Great Famine of 1845, but her co-pilot Philip thinks it\u0027s more likely to be the 1931 financial dustbowl.  Meanwhile Jacob, who some of you may remember from when he used to sit at the back of the plane, has somehow got into the cockpit and having assumed the role of navigator is quoting the Book of Proverbs, and trying to get us all on the right heading for the Glorious Revolution of 1688, by taking us first to the Black Death of 1348 which he believes we would all appreciate a glimpse of. I am aware that in the two hours we\u0027ve been on this plane, which have seemed more like years to many of us, concern has grown among passengers about what exactly will happen when we land and so I have been asked to issue you with instructions about what to do if it turns out the runway we are heading for does not, in fact, exist. Now, I don\u0027t want you to worry, but in the 5 minutes - is that all? Feels like a month - since I was put in charge of the cabin crew I have looked all over the plane and not been able to find any emergency exits. I was wondering if I could ask you now to look around and let me know if you can see any possible escape routes. Just wave at me if you can.    Oh I\u0027m sorry, I forgot your hands were tied. Well, I do have some good news in that a 100% organic meal will be served, just as soon as it is licensed by the airport we are leaving and got through, uh, about 9 months of red tape. On the plus side it will be very cheap as there is a limited market for well-rotted swede, even if swallowing it seems a high price to pay.  On the subject of payment, I\u0027m aware most of you use credit cards to make purchases abroad and there may be higher charges for doing so, depending on where we land exactly, and indeed whether money still forms part of our society at that time. Our stewards are now passing round a hat into which you are all encouraged to put your loose change, house deeds, flexible friends and first-born child if you have one, or somebody else\u0027s if you don\u0027t. Please don\u0027t be alarmed if you have less to put in the hat than your neighbour, because we do have complimentary sandwiches on board and you will still be able to enjoy a BLT once we have landed, and although it might be a little damp and curly by then I can put to rest right now the rumour that we will be asking Her Majesty\u0027s Armed Forces to feed them to you.  All service personnel will instead be asked to stand by the cabin door to deal with 7 times the current volume of border checks on people, services and goods, because we do not have nearly enough customs officials and while we could just wave you all off down the stairs, or inflatable ramp depending on what happens, we think there could be hostile customs officials at our destination who will make things worse if we don\u0027t.    I\u0027ve also been authorised to tell you that we will be recruiting 9,000 extra air traffic controllers to organise our landing , and although we will be running out of fuel in 35 minutes or so I can assure you that will feel more like 7 months, so plenty of time to enjoy the company of loved ones before the rule of law enters a period where we don\u0027t know whose law it will be.  As we have left the European Aviation Safety Agency - I know we all assumed we\u0027d find a way to stay in this, I know I did, but it seems that your previous stewardess David didn\u0027t get the paperwork done before he jumped - the plane and indeed the pilot are no longer insured, which is actually good news as it should bring down the overall cost of any flights you decide to take, if you manage to survive this one. Er, hello sir? Are you wiggling your eyebrows and making those strangled noises to get my attention? Yes, yes, ah right, I understand. For those of you who didn\u0027t hear, this gentleman in the fourth row has indicated that all this is giving him a headache and he\u0027s wondering if there is any aspirin aboard. A few of you may be in a similar situation, particularly in Blairite class where there\u0027s been some headbutting. We carry six aspirin at all times, and aware of a possible delay in supplies we have ordered an extra six aspirin to be stockpiled. These will be brought onto the plane as soon as we make physical contact with the ground, and I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll go a long way towards alleviating the painful injuries some of us may sustain during that process.  Now, I\u0027ve saved the best news til last which is that I have managed to find a parachute in the shape of the World Trade Organisation. It has a simple set of rules which, once we\u0027ve dusted them off, will mean more complicated rules on pretty much everything, more paperwork, more laws for things like credit ratings agencies, and so many rules for stuff like paediatric medicine that actually we\u0027re planning to ignore those completely and just give sick children whatever the hell we can find.  WHOAH! Just a bit of turbulence there, I believe the fact that Boris, our trainee pilot, ran screaming from the cockpit, down the aisle and hauled up a floor panel to interfere with the landing gear just shifted some weight around, but we\u0027ve steadied now. As I was about to say, we have this great parachute, although it turns out that it renders individual trade deals impossible, it requires the building of a brick wall covered in barbed wire in Northern Ireland, and in fact the WTO hasn\u0027t actually agreed we can use it so I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m even mentioning it.  You should really stop weeping, and try to be more like Mr Corbyn here who is calmly suggesting alterations to the in-flight magazine, and who despite sitting nearest to the cockpit is making no effort at all to seize control of it.  Oh, and I forgot to say, but those of you who are British ex-pats may not be able to access your bank accounts after we land. Anyone who needs the services of a sperm donor will find that a lot more difficult too. On this last count, I understand Boris has offered to masturbate for free if the Daily  will report on it.

John McDonnell defended the Labour leader - saying he had devoted his life to securing peace in the Middle East - after Mr Corbyn was heavily criticised for the remarks. In footage revealed last night, the Labour leader was seen discussing a speech given by Palestinian Ambassador Manuel Hassassian on the rights of the Palestinian people.  Mr Corbyn said: This was dutifully recorded by the - thankfully silent - Zionists in the audience on that occasion. And then [they] came up and berated him afterwards for what he had said. “They clearly have two problems. One is that they don’t want to study history. And secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time - probably all their lives - they don’t understand English irony either.” Labour MP Luciana Berger said the video contained inexcusable comments which made her feel unwelcome in my own party.   She wrote on Twitter : The video released today of the leader of Labour making inexcusable comments - defended by a party spokesman - makes me as a proud British Jew feel unwelcome in my own party.  I\u0027ve lived in Britain all my life and I don\u0027t need any lessons in history/irony. Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that the video had been taken out of context. I think this has all been taken out of context: whatever Jeremy has said throughout the years has always been about how to secure peace, particularly within the Middle East and also peace with justice for all concerned - both members of the Jewish community and also members of the Palestinian community, he said. In that context Jeremy has devoted his life, so I think this would take expressions out of context in that way are not helping.

They\u0027ve deliberately been played down so people won\u0027t be alarmed at the prospect of crashing out in March 2019. Sweat-drenched Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab even denied there would be a “sandwich famine”. Calming fears of the unlikely event like an air steward, he added: You will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the army to maintain food supplies. But as reassuring as this must be to everyone, by no means is it all good news. Mr Raab sensationally admitted the government is poised to recruit 9,000 new civil servants to work on Brexit - on top of 7,000 already - and said: Real livelihoods are at stake here.  Mr Raab also announced plans to recruit 1,000 more Border Force staff, on top of current recruitment for 300 border staff that is already underway.  Buried in hundreds of pages of small print of his No Deal \u0027technical notices\u0027 - of which there will eventually be about 80 - are some proper nasties that would make life more difficult in the UK. Already the plans have prompted outrage. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the Government\u0027s negotiating strategy.  Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones added: The writing is on the wall. No-deal would be a catastrophic failure of the UK Government that would cause huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage to all parts of the UK. TUC general secretary Frances O\u0027Grady said the reports confirmed no-deal Brexit would be devastating for working people. Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) National Chairman Mike Cherry said: The dangers of a sudden and unplanned no-deal Brexit have today been laid bare. So what do the documents say? We\u0027re rounding up what we\u0027ve found in the worst of the small print. 1. It will cost you more to use your credit card  The cost of using a credit card to buy goods or services from an EU company is likely to rise. That is because cross-border payments will no longer be covered by the EU\u0027s very recently introduced credit card surcharge ban. In 2015, British consumers were charged \u0026pound166million. Remain-backing peer Lord Adonis, of the Best for Britain group, said: No one voted for this two years ago.  Companies based in the EU, such as Airbnb and Ryanair – both used by millions of people – would no longer be bound by rules limiting what they can charge UK customers who pay by plastic. Who even knew that card payments were going to be affected by Brexit. It\u0027s time for a people\u0027s vote. 2. It will cost more and take longer to buy anything from the EU  This one is somewhat obvious but the papers confirm it in all its horrifying detail. If there’s no deal, UK-based payment service providers such as PayPal would lose direct access to the EU’s central payments structure.  This mean customers “could face increased costs and slower processing times for EU transactions”, the papers say. Meanwhile, the papers sketch out a whole load of new hoops UK businesses would need to jump through before importing goods from the EU. They include registering for a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification Number and submitting import declarations to HM Revenue and Customs. Businesses are being advised directly by the government to look into buying up warehouse space for goods awaiting customs approval.  A stockpile of six weeks\u0027 worth of 200 medicines already exists due to the threat of French lorry strikes. But now the government is asking pharmaceutical companies to ensure they have an additional six weeks supply of medicines in the UK - on top of their own normal stock levels. The warning comes in a letter to pharma firms today by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Brexit Secretary Mr Raab told the BBC: There are potential issues around the border in the worst case scenario. So it\u0027s right, too, we will be working with industry around stockpiling of medicines for a working assumption of six weeks. 4. UK farmers face NINE-MONTH wait for exports that could bankrupt them  UK farmers face a crippling nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. That is because logos on packaging would need to change, with UK producers being forced to drop the EU\u0027s organic food logo.  Yet the farmers would not be allowed to apply for this change until 30 March 2019 - and there is a nine-month wait. We are exploring alternative approaches that should speed up this process, say the technical notes - but they don\u0027t explain what those approaches will be. Lib Dem MP Tim Farron, of the Best For Britain anti-Brexit group, said: A nine month wait for organic farmers to sell their produce into their biggest market would see farmers up and down the country wiped out. The Government’s disastrous mishandling of these negotiations looks almost certain to lead to British organic farmers being put out of business – nobody voted for that. NFU President Minette Batters said: Not only would this be hugely disruptive but it threatens livelihoods and businesses in the UK. 5. Expat Brits could lose access to their pensions  It doesn\u0027t look good for Brits living abroad who still have a bank account in the UK.  They may face restrictions on their ability to borrow money and in accessing certain insurance.  In particular, UK expats in the EU could lose access to their pension income and other financial services, the papers warn. Lending and deposit services, insurance and annuities - which people rely on for a regular pension income - could all be affected. The notes warn that UK citizens abroad may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA.  If there\u0027s no deal, any parcel from the EU to the UK worth up to \u0026pound135 would have VAT charged on top.  It could be charged to the overseas firm sending the parcel - which in turn would charge VAT on customers at the point of purchase. This means a hike of around \u0026pound20 on mid-value parcels being sent into Britain in a No Deal Brexit. 7. Workers will lose an important voice in the workplace  No new requests to set up European Works Councils will be accepted after a No Deal Brexit. These are bodies within a company that represent European employees and keep up communication between them and management about the progress of the business. Labour - who repeatedly claimed Brexit could be an excuse to water down workers\u0027 rights - slammed the plans. Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: The Prime Minister has waxed lyrical about protecting workers’ hard-won rights after we leave the EU. However, as is typical with this Tory Government, it was nothing but meaningless empty rhetoric. By not allowing new European Works Councils to form, nor having a contingency plan to replace them, the Tories are leaving British workers at a disadvantage compared to their EU colleagues. Leaving workers out of the loop and out of negotiations with management about pay and their terms and conditions. 8. New medicines will face a major chunk of red tape  New medicines will need UK approval before they can be made available to patients in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which regulates drugs in the UK, will take on the functions of the EU if an agreement is not reached by March 29. Products will have to go through national assessment before they receive market authorisation to be sold in the UK. The notice states: After EU exit, to market a product in the UK, an initial market authorisation application will need to be submitted to the MHRA and will go through a national assessment. MHRA will take a streamlined approach to approving UK market authorisation applications that places no greater burden on industry and ensures that patients can access new and innovative medicines at the same time as EU patients. Most new medicines currently come to the market through a licensing route overseen by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 9. Brits could face longer queues at Dover  We\u0027re still not sure on whether Kent\u0027s main motorways will be turned into a lorry park as some experts have warned. There is still no clarity on whether customs will be collected at the border delaying lorries coming into the UK.  But the note does admit that officials will need to minimise delays.  It says: HMRC will work closely with industry to ensure its interventions are conducted in a way which minimises delays and additional burdens for legitimate trade, while robustly ensuring compliance.  10. Cigarette firms will have to fork out for horrifying new pictures of lungs  We know, we know - get your tiny violin for costs incurred to tobacco firms. But really, tobacco companies will have to come up with some new horrifying pictures of people’s lungs - because the “existing picture library is owned by the European Commission”. The Government says cigarette and tobacco packets will have to have the new pictures from day one of when we leave the EU. 11. Bad news for hunters?  The European Firearms Pass would no longer be available for people in the UK taking their personal firearms to the EU. They should still be allowed to take them as a temporary export.  However, they would need to be sure that the individual country will let them re-export them - i.e. bring them back to the EU. 12. Britain\u0027s men could have to do more masturbating. All for Britain, of course  It\u0027s pub quiz time. Who knew that Britain imports bucketloads of sperm - 3,000 samples in 2017 - from Denmark? Well, it\u0027s true. Those imports can likely continue in a no-deal Brexit, the technical notices say. But in order for that to happen, UK importers would need to reach agreements with individual establishments exporting sperm for use in fertility clinics. That adds extra red tape. The papers insist it will be a minimum burden. But what if it can\u0027t be overcome? There\u0027s only one answer, surely - the nation\u0027s men must masturbate for Britain! 13. And finally... We STILL don\u0027t know how to sort the Northern Ireland border problem "},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cause","story":"NewsNo deal Brexit could cause national SPERM shortage, government documents warnA no deal Brexit could slow the flow of Danish semen into the UKShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter09:05, 24 AUG 2018Updated09:06, 24 AUG 2018NewsIt could slow the flow of Danish semen into Britain (Image: Getty Images)Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA no deal Brexit could cause a national shortage of sperm, Government documents have warned. It means people trying to conceive a child could be hit by delayes. Danish semen made up almost half of all non-British male reproductive material imported to the UK in 2017, the paper from the Department of Health and Social Care revealed. Some 3,000 samples from the Scandinavian nation were brought in, alongside a small number from other EU states, plus 4,000 from the United States. It is mainly bought from commercial sperm banks. But leaving the trade bloc without a deal would see the UK leave the EU Organ Directives and EU Tissues and Cells Directives, which cover material from human sperm, eggs and embryos to transplant organs. The note adds that egg and embryo imports are less common than sperm, usually fewer than 500 a year, and are mostly from EU countries.  The paper says: UK licensed establishments working in this area, such as hospitals, stem cell laboratories, tissue banks and fertility clinics, would continue to work to the same quality and safety standards as they did before exit, but some would need new written agreements with relevant EU establishments. UK licensed establishments that import or export tissues or cells from EEA establishments would need to make written agreements with those EEA establishments to continue importing or exporting these products post-exit. However, this will for the most part be a minimum burden on industry. For example, UK licensed establishments that already hold an import licence to import tissues and cells from third countries will be able to use their existing written agreements with third country organisations as a template.

Dominic Henbow Hendy, 28, hid the device behind toilet rolls at a huge 200-guest summer party for the retail giant at Hawker House, in Canada Water, south east London. A court heard Hendy carried out the act on July 12 after he had been without without sexual contact for a year and felt stressed and was not thinking straight.” A cleaner discovered the camera at around 2am which showed full-frontal views of people using the toilet, the court heard.  Hendy, pleaded guilty at London’s Camberwell Green Magistrates Court to voyeurism, namely installing equipment to observe others for his sexual gratification, reports Cornwall Live. The court heard he had been celibate for a year after the break down of a previous relationship, which sent him into a spiral of anxiety. The court also heard he would self-medicate with ketamine and crystal meth. His lawyer, Alexander Goscimski said: He was without sexual contact for a year and felt stressed and was not thinking straight.” Prosecutor Chidi Ikwuakolam had told the court : A cleaner at the event was routinely cleaning the men’s toilet and came across a small black box on the floor and handed it into a security guard, assuming it was lost property.  By 2am the manager realised it was a camera that’d been put carefully on the floor of one of the one-person cubicles and purposefully obstructed with toilet rolls. It showed full-frontal views of people using the toilet and the defendant was identified as the person who placed the camera in the location.” Probation Officer Patrick Acres told the court: “Prior to this offence he had been in a relationship and when that ended it sent him into a spiral of anxiety.

But wait, it\u0027s not over yet, we\u0027ve got one last bank holiday to go and it\u0027s really worth being prepared for it. By this point, we\u0027ve all had enough of cowering from the heatwave sun so the end-of-summer cooldown is most welcome. That means it’s the ideal time to get out and enjoy some activities. Below we\u0027ve pulled together some great ideas for making the most out of the last bank holiday before Christmas... Get out on a family cycling adventure  If you\u0027ve been putting off taking the kids out to practise cycling, this last bank holiday is the ideal time to get out for a ride. Head out to some quiet woodland, or check out the Halfords widget below to find your nearest cycling route.   If you want to head further afield, then don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s easy enough to add a bike rack to your car.  The Thule ProRide 591 Roof Mount Bike Carrier (above) is \u0026pound75 (save \u0026pound35) and useful because you can add more than one to a roof rack - making it perfect for growing families. Halfords also sell a wide range of roof racks - and will fit them for you too. Enjoy a camping trip to Scotland  One of the great things about Scotland - aside from the stunning countryside - is freedom to roam. It means camping is allowed on public, unenclosed, land for no more than two or three nights. Your other option is to visit one of the many existing campsites across the country, such as at Loch Lomond (try Ardlui), Loch Ness (consider Borlum), or one of the many along the coast (check out Clachtoll Beach Campsite at Sutherland).  For camping, we suggest the Halfords 4 Person Double Skin Tent (above) which is now just \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound60, and takes just 15 minutes to pitch. If you\u0027re driving with all your camping gear, you\u0027ll also want to consider boot space.  It\u0027s surprising how much stuff you need to take the kids away for a couple of nights and you don\u0027t want to be uncomfortable in the car.  For added space, grab the Exodus 470L Black Roof Box Fully Fitted Bundle (above) from Halfords. It\u0027s \u0026pound389 (save \u0026pound98) and includes the fitting and a roof rack suitable for your car. Find the perfect spot for a picnic  Take a picnic out with you and you\u0027ll have everything you need for a great day out. You could even pack the Halfords Portable Gas Stove (below), which is now \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12). But don\u0027t forget to pick up the correct Campingaz CP250 (A4) Gas Cartridge to go with it - these are just \u0026pound2 each or four for \u0026pound5.  Just make sure you\u0027re allowed to cook at your destination – many beaches only allow barbeques and small stoves after most people have gone home. It\u0027s well worth checking with the local council if you\u0027re not sure. Go on a great road trip!  A day trip or staycation break by road could be perfect for your family. Avoid queues by bagging a handy sat nav - which will also keep you on route and give you a pretty reliable answer to the \u0027are we there yet?\u0027 question. The Garmin Drive Sat Nav (below) - priced \u0026pound89.99 (save \u0026pound10) comes with lifetime map updates so you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.  Also be sure to check your car is in good shape before heading out as there\u0027s nothing worse than planning a great bank holiday trip only to be thwarted by vehicle trouble. There are some simple things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, how is your car battery doing? Telltale signs that something is wrong include trouble starting the engine and lights that are dim when the engine isn\u0027t running - simple enough to check when you\u0027re parked up. Also, be wary that the hot summer months have a big impact on your car battery.

On Saturday the M1 is predicted to be badly affected from Junction 22 to Junction 25 in the East Midlands, with journey times increasing from a typical 16 minutes to 62 minutes.   Any other traffic jam hotspots?  - The M20 from Junction 9 to Junction 3 in the South East between 7.30am and 9.30am on Friday - The M6 from Junction 28 to Junction 32 in the North West between 12pm and 3pm on Friday - The M5 from Junction 22 to Junction 20 in the South West between 2pm and 4.30pm on Saturday RAC traffic spokesman Rod Dennis said the Bank Holiday has huge potential to bring gridlock to major roads.

Check-in, passport con\u0026shy\u0026shytrol, security and baggage reclaim were also criticised. All three Manchester terminals fared badly along with Stansted.

Rory Boland, Which? travel editor said: “Travellers want to start their trips in the smoothest way, but long queues through airports and a lack of facilities can cast a rain cloud over any getaway. “With new routes launching all the time, passengers have an increasing choice over not just who they fly with but where they fly from.

Chief executive Nick Barton said it had been voted London’s best airport last week following analysis of data from the Civil Aviation Authority.  He added: “As we near the end of our biggest transformation we’re proud to have recently opened 30 new shops and restaurants. We’ve also added close to a thousand new seats throughout the terminal and doubled the size of our security search area. “Evidence of our focus on improving the passenger experience is paying off.

Corporal Alec Jay was captured at Dunkirk in 1940 and taken to the notorious German Setzdorf prison camp.  One afternoon, while the prisoners were playing football an SS officer arrive, stopped the game and shouted out: Were is Alex, the Jew?  The British soldiers formed a protective ring around him and told the Nazi he would have to \u0027shoot them all\u0027 to get to him. A tense stand-off ensued and the German guards carrying machine guns eventually backed down. The remarkable story has now come to light after Cpl Jay\u0027s son John discovered his late father\u0027s memoirs and has published them in a book \u0027Facing Fearful Odds\u0027.  His father never spoke of his wartime experiences although in his final years he began to write his memoirs before abandoning the project. John, a 61-year-old financier, discovered the transcript which had been typed out on his late mother\u0027s typewriter in a plastic bag while sorting through her belongings following her death. He said: “After the surrender, my father faced fearful odds because he was imprisoned by a regime dedicated to exterminating his race.  Cpl Jay was born in Clapham Common in 1919 and worked on the stock exchange before the outbreak of war. He was a Bren gunner in the Queen Victoria Rifles who although vastly outnumbered held out for four days against two German Panzer divisions during the siege of Calais. The crucial rearguard of 3,000 British soldiers against an enemy force of 25,000 enabled the Allies to evacuate hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk and regroup in Britain. But he was captured and sent first to a camp in Aachen, Germany, and after that to Setzdorf work camp. Cpl Jay escaped four times from Setzdorf but was recaptured on each occasion, until the guards sent him back to Lamsdorf where he stayed until early 1945.

The patient was on a flight from Saudi Arabia to the UK which landed at Manchester Airport last week. The ill traveller has since been diagnosed with the virus that caused Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Manchester Evening News reports. Public Health England (PHE) say the overall risk to the general public is very low, but passengers sitting near the patient on that flight will be informed and monitored. It is only the fifth case ever seen in the UK and the first since 2013, according to PHE.  MERS symptoms range to a fever, cough and shortness of breath to serious respiratory failure. Some patients also contract pneumonia and around a third of sufferers worldwide have died. The latest patient’s age and sex have not been released by officials due to patient confidentiality, but they were initially admitted to a hospital in Leeds before being transferred to the Royal Liverpool Hospital, which is an expert centre for respiratory infectious disease centre. PHE say the patient, who is a resident in the Middle East where they are said to have contracted the virus, are currently stable and receiving treatment. MERS-Cov, the virus that causes MERS, can be spread can be spread when someone is in close contact with a patient for a sustained period of time, with health bosses saying there is a very low risk to the general population of becoming ill. However, those who were sitting close to the affected passenger on Saudi Arabian Airlines flight SV123 which arrived into Manchester Airport last Thursday, August 16, will be alerted and monitored in the coming weeks. The illness, which is from the same family as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.   Since then there have been 2,207 confirmed cases and 787 deaths worldwide, according to reports.  The most serious outbreak of the disease happened in South Korea and China in May and June 2015 where there were 1886 cases and 36 deaths.  \u0027Patient zero\u0027 brought the virus back to South Korea from the Middle East on May 4 that year.  Due to aircraft recycling air in the cabin, bosses say only those sitting three rows in front, or three rows behind will be contacted, and those passengers who don’t hear anything are not considered to be at risk. A PHE statement said: “As a precautionary measure, PHE experts are working closely with NHS colleagues to advise them on infection control measures. “They will be contacting people who might have been in close contact with the individual to monitor their symptoms and provide health advice. “This will include contacting a number of passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight.

Delighted Anna Rodrigues, 34, is expecting a baby daughter in November.  Tipping the scales at nearly 15 stone, Anna, of Andoversford, near Cheltenham, used to cover up in cardigans and leggings as a diet of shop-bought sandwiches and takeaways took their toll. The final straw came in February 2017 when she was struggling to fall pregnant- and was told she had to shed the pounds to be considered for IVF.  She suffers polycystic ovarian syndrome and was told to cut out carbohydrates so after some research she found the Cambridge Weight Plan and consultant Sarah Hall of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. I poured out my heart to her in a really long message, said Anna. I had to lose weight to be considered for IVF. I was nearly 15 stone and a size 18. I always struggled with my size but I didn\u0027t realise I had polycystic ovaries which was holding me back. I would eat all the wrong things- a wrap, crisps and chocolate bar for lunch and takeaways for tea.  I was determined to change so I could have a baby, it has always been my dream. After marrying husband Elvio from Madeira four years ago, the couple decided they wanted children, especially as he comes from a big family. Sarah gave Anna a personalised weight plan. A typical day involved drinking a vanilla shake for breakfast, a microwave meal such as chicken tikka for lunch and a sachet of porridge for dinner. Anna found the weight was dropping off and within four months she had lost three stone. She had to introduce homemade cooked meals by April and joined the David Lloyd gym in Gloucester.  Last September, she returned to her consultant who was amazed by her transformation, as she got down to 10st 2lb. She couldn\u0027t believe how much weight I had lost in a few months, Anna said. But I was so determined. I wanted to get the ball rolling and I was delighted they put us forward for IVF. Soon afterwards, Anna fell pregnant. However, a week before Easter she was worried when a scan did not show the baby\u0027s heartbeat. Devastated, she had to wait a week for more news. Then the lady said she could see her heart fluttering. She said she was like a little avocado. Me and my husband couldn\u0027t stop crying. We are so excited now we can\u0027t wait.

A JD Wetherspoon spokesman revealed that the group\u0027s hard-working staff had grown tired of picking up poop, reports Somerset Live .  And the company said it had been lenient with dog owners in recent years but would be strictly prohibiting all pooches from now.  Announcing the news, a statement from Wetherspoons said: Please note that Wetherspoon has a policy of not allowing dogs in its pubs, including all outside areas. (Assistance Dogs excepted).   This policy was introduced shortly after the company was founded in 1979, although in recent years we have allowed a few exceptions. After much consultation, we will now be strictly enforcing this policy everywhere. In order to give those affected time to adjust we have set a deadline of Monday, September 10, 2018.  Wetherspoons, founded in 1979 by Tim Martin , has just under 1,000 outlets around the country.   The exception to the rule is assistance dogs who will be allowed inside and beer gardens. Spokesman Eddie Gershon added: Even well behaved dogs can be unpredictable, every dog owner thinks their dog is perfect. We welcome a lot of children and families and younger children in particular can be unpredictable around dogs and many are scared of dogs. We serve a lot of food. Unfortunately not all owners are diligent over cleaning up dog mess.

The young royal started at St Thomas\u0027 Battersea, in south west London, last September and he\u0027s now about to start Year 1 .  As well as maths, English and all the other normal subjects, George\u0027s \u0026pound17,604-a-year school also offers up some other learning opportunities. And there\u0027s one compulsory class the little royal will take every week - and it\u0027s not something you find on many Year 1 lesson timetables.  According to the school\u0027s curriculum guidelines, all Year 1 pupils must take part in a 35 minute ballet class every week. The lessons follows the Royal Academy of Dance\u0027s Pre-Primary in Dance syllabus, and there\u0027s a pianist in every class. The curriculum states: This syllabus develops students\u0027 physical skills, stamina, creativity, expression and musicality, using a range of sounds and musical styles. This strong foundation prepares students for a successful transition to ballet and other dance genres.  We seek to:  develop creative and aesthetic awareness inspire a sense of physical and mental confidence encourage good posture and bodily expression develop social interaction provide insight into art forms associated with Ballet and dance build self-confidence perform with expression and interpretation lay the foundations of classical Ballet technique.  As well as ballet, Prince George\u0027s week will be packed with interesting and exciting subjects. French Prince George started learning French in Reception, and this year he\u0027ll have one 35 minute class a week in the coming school year. His class will be taught days of the week, classroom objects, colours and Christmas words. They will also learn traditional French songs, so we expect there will be lots of fun sing-a-longs. Geography There\u0027s a good change George will be good at this one, as his dad Prince William studied geography at university.  In the next two years, students at the school will be taught geographical vocabulary, how to recognise changes in the environment and how to make maps. They should also be able to recognise how places have become the way they are and how they are changing, and to realise how places are linked to other places in the world. Music Music is very important at St Thomas\u0027s, and more than 90 per cent of kids learn an instrument. In Year 1, they will study Peter and the Wolf, as well as learning about simple song writing, music theory and different assemblies. The year group will also put on a music show. Computing Year 1 children at the school will spend 40 minutes each week learning computer skills in the Lower School\u0027s Computing Suite, which has 22 machines. They will be taught how to log on, open programmes and use Word, while building confidence using a mouse.

Little Caden and his mother, Hannah Sewell, were in the supermarket buying some food on Saturday when the youngster spotted his favorite packet of apples in their trolley. Caden, who does not speak, was so excited he started to jump up and down. But his happiness was short-lived when a stranger in the store come up to Hannah and said: Control your kid because people are trying to shop. Shocked mum Hannah apologised to the woman and told her that Caden was just excited, but claims the woman just rolled her eyes and interrupted her. To make matters worse, the woman then did something Hannah really wasn\u0027t expecting.  The woman bent down to get closer to Caden, who used to be afraid of strangers. He got excited again thinking the woman was going to say hello. But instead, Hannah says, the woman got close to his face and asked him: What is wrong with you, does your mommy never take you anywhere? As Caden has no verbal skills he could not reply - and Hannah claims the woman laughed when she told her this. Hannah left her shopping and took heartbroken Caden for some chicken nuggets in the hope of cheering him up, but he was too upset to eat and sat there distraught. In an open message to the woman on Facebook , which has been shared 161,000 times, has 76,000 comments and 264,000 reactions, Hannah, from South Carolina, writes: To the woman in Aldi that made my son and me feel like complete sh*t today. I\u0027m sorry you felt that my son being excited about getting a bag of his favorite apples and jumping up and down beside me was such a big deal that you needed to ask me to control my kid because people are trying to shop.

But instead of saying hi, you got close to his face and asked him \u0027What is wrong with you, does your mommy never take you anywhere?\u0027 Then you pointed out that he didn\u0027t say anything back to you. When I informed you that he is unable to talk, you laughed and said \u0027No surprise there, he cant even walk through a store\u0027 before walking away. I\u0027m not sure if you can tell, but you broke his f***ing heart and mine when you did that. I left all of my groceries and walked out of the store. I took him to Wendys, his favorite place. I thought he would like some nuggets and he loves the apple slices there because they\u0027re different colors and he can line the colors up on his tray.

Despite weakening to a Category 3 hurricane, the monster storm remained a major threat to life as locals and tourists hunkered down in homes, hotels and emergency shelters.  Rivers were turned into raging streams after Lane battered Hawaii\u0027s Big Island with more than 24ins of rain in just 24 hours, causing castastrophic flooding. The volcanic archipelago in the Pacific is now bracing for 120mph winds, 25ft waves, heavier rain and a life-threatening storm surge as the hurricane spins closer to its shores.  Hurricane warnings were issued for Oahu and Maui, where the storm is expected to hit later Friday, while hurricane or tropical storm watches were in place in other areas. Flash fooding is a major concern as forecasters warn that a dangerous storm surge and huge destructive waves could raise water levels by 5ft above normal tide levels on south and west shores. Governor David Ige said there was “catastrophic flooding” on Big Island after unrelenting downpours. Officials have warned that the extreme rainfall and storm surge could result in numerous evacuations and rescues.  Five tourists from California were rescued from a home that flooded as water levels rose in Hilo on Thursday. Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell told reporters: Lane, while it\u0027s been downgraded, is wide and very moist and it\u0027s going to hang around for a while, because it\u0027s moving slowly. That\u0027s why we\u0027re taking so much precaution here. Lane is likely to be a prolonged rain event, meaning it will be days before residents are out of danger.  Heavy rain is expected to last through Sunday and into early next week in Lane\u0027s wake, with up to 40ins possible in some places before skies clear.  Landslides and flash floods have blocked roads, and trees toppled by strong winds have taken out power lines, cutting electricity to hundreds of homes. Forecasters said Lane will batter Hawaii as it moves in a slow general northward motion through Friday before turning towards the west on Saturday and picking up speed. It will weaken over the weekend, but it will remain a hurricane the eye moves over or close to the main Hawaiian islands.   The latest predictions showed the eye spinning west of the Big Island before glancing past Maui and several other islands later in the day on its way to Oahu. But authorities warned that the islands could still expect to be hit hard. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for Hawaii and ordered federal authorities to help state and local officials. Those who chose to ride out the storm cleared supermarket shelves days in advance as they prepared for a lengthy disruption. Mr Ige has urged residents to set aside a 14-day supply of water, food and medicine. Petrol stations ran out of fuel as drivers topped up their tanks fears of a possible shortage after Lane hits. Residents living in flood danger zones have been ordered to leave their homes, schools have been closed and public services have been halted.

According to the latest predictions, Hurricane Lane will hit the northern most point of Oahu first before moving south towards the state capital of Honolulu.  If the hurricane stays on its current track, Honolulu and the island of Maui will be hit in the early hours of Friday morning local time. The storm could be one of the worst to hit the U.S. island chain in 25 years with threats of high winds and lashing rains and the potential to trigger flooding and landslides.  Residents have been warned to stockpile a 14-day supply of water, food and medicines in preparation for the storm as schools, government offices and businesses closed. Packing sustained winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour), Lane could dump as much as 20 inches of rain triggering flash floods and landslides, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. More than 30 inches could fall in some places, it said. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, the NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu said in an advisory. As of early Thursday, Lane was centered about 210 miles (335 km) south-southwest of Kailua-Kona, a town on the west coast of the Big Island, the NWS said.  It was classified as a powerful Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength.  The NWS said the storm weakened slightly overnight but excessive rainfall would affect the Hawaiian islands into the weekend, leading to significant and life-threatening flash flooding and landslides.  More than a foot of rain has already fallen on part of the Big Island, the NWS said on Thursday morning. The centre also warned of very large and damaging surf along exposed west- and south-facing shorelines, likely leading to significant coastal erosion.  A hurricane warning was in effect for Oahu, Maui County and Hawaii County. The islands of Kauai and Niihau remained on hurricane watch and could face similar conditions starting Friday morning.  Governor David Ige has urged residents to take the threat seriously and prepare for the worst by setting aside a 14-day supply of water, food and medicines.   All public schools, University of Hawaii campuses and nonessential government offices on the islands of Oahu and Kauai will be closed for at least two days starting on Thursday, Mr Ige said Wednesday.  The shelves of a downtown Honolulu Walmart were stripped of items ranging from canned tuna to dog food as well as bottled water and coolers full of ice after warnings of possible power outages.   I went to Safeway last night for regular groceries. Everyone was in a panic, said Thao Nguyen, 35, an employee at a Honolulu branch of Hawaiian shirt retailer Roberta Oaks.   Long lines of cars formed at gasoline stations in Honolulu and people pulled small boats from the water ahead of the expected storm surge.  U.S. Navy ships and submarines based in Hawaii were instructed to leave port, a common practice when a hurricane approaches to avoid damage.

So when royal fans spotted the Duke and Duchess of Sussex jumping in a taxi, tucking into a pub lunch and walking the dog in a public park, they were a tad confused.

Jessica O\u0027Neill began professional cuddling six months ago and could soon earn up to \u0026pound45,000 [$79,000 AUD]-a-year by cuddling strangers at her studio based on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The 35-year-old - who has spent a decade being a massage therapist and counsellor - has only recently introduced cuddle therapy to her treatment list. Jessica claims the cuddles - which start at \u0026pound46 [$80]-an-hour - help people suffering loneliness and depression to feel loved, valued and cared about. She said: I\u0027ve always been a really affectionate person and have always cuddled people. It\u0027s just in my nature and is part of who I am. My mother was always super affectionate and loving when I was young. Her hugs always made everything okay even if there were bad things happening around us. I\u0027ve always had a really lovely response from the people I\u0027ve hugged. Everyone loves a cuddle.  She continued: I started massage therapy when I was 20. I then went on to do fitness instruction, nutrition and counselling. I love massage because when I touch people I can really pick up what is truly going on. Often people don\u0027t express what their feeling, but through touch we can break down that exterior shell. When I started counselling, I just felt like my clients needed more. I wanted to be closer to them, so I could pick up on what they were feeling. It\u0027s not normal to give your clients a cuddle. These environments are usually very clinical and sterile. It is extremely hard in those situations for people to let go of their false ego or hard exterior they\u0027ve created for protection and unlock their true potential. It all started when I began giving my clients a hug when they\u0027d come in for a counselling session. It totally allowed them to drop their guard and open up so much more. I could see their anxiety and tension melt away. Then I could get to the core of their persona and do what I can to heal them. So really, it was a long time coming. I first heard about cuddle therapy six years ago, and I remember telling everyone that what I wanted to do. They thought I was crazy, and probably still do. But I love it so much. It\u0027s so much more rewarding than just massage or counselling. I feel like it\u0027s what I was put on this earth for.  Cuddle therapy with Jessica starts at $80-an-hour for \u0027strictly cuddles\u0027 in the studio, while hugs and counselling costs \u0026pound63 [$110] per session. For those longing for the blissful combination of caffeine and cuddles, a \u0027friendship style\u0027 session of drinking coffee followed by cuddles will set you back \u0026pound86 [$150]. Jessica said most of her clients are men over the aged of 35, but revealed she has a growing number of middle aged women seeking cuddles too. She also claims that there are younger men coming in for cuddles due to experiencing \u0027loneliness and disconnection\u0027 in the digital age. And despite the cuddle sessions being intimate, Jessica insists that 99 percent of her clients are \u0027very well behaved\u0027 and never cross boundaries - but has had \u0027one or two\u0027 awkward experiences.

The brand\u0027s Naked palettes have been dubbed the iPhone of make-up and are beloved by many for their nude and golden shades. Various knock off versions of the palettes have popped up in stores since they were first launched in 2010. And it seems that in future you may have to consider buying a dupe instead of the real thing, because Urban Decay have just dropped a massive bombshell.  The company announced today that they are discontinuing their original Naked palette. Yep, I\u0027m sorry to say, you read that right. It\u0027s not 100 per cent clear why this decision has been made, but the palette\u0027s creator, Wende Zomnir, said it was essential for the company to always evolve and that they would turn the grief into greatness. In a statement, Urban Decay added: Today the beauty world mourns Urban Decay\u0027s beloved Naked Palette , the product that revolutionized neutral eyeshadows.  A little bit naughty, often dramatic, and always in the press, the innovative game-changer and category creator will be laid to rest after eight years, without a smudge of regret. Passionate Naked collectors - and pretty much anyone with eyes - will remember Naked as the beauty product that changed their lids forver. It was beautiful and mythical and millions of superfans, from misfits to moms to models, will miss Naked from Virgin to Gunmetal. Urban Decay have even gone as far as to hold a funeral for the palette, which they said took place in Newport Beach in California on August 23. Beauty influencers such as Kandee Johnson, Christen Dominique, Katy DeGroot, Shayla Mitchell, and Chrisspy attended to pay their respects to Naked, while the eulogy was read by Nicole Richie .  Make-up fans on twitter have also been mourning the loss of the product. One wrote: A moment of silence please for the OG eyeshadow palette that started it all. So long Urban Decay Naked Palette. Another commented: So sad Urban Decay is getting rid of their OG Naked palette that palette will forever remind me of all the times I used it while getting ready to go out with my bestie during our college days.

kamara","story":"\t\t\t\t\tGlen Kamara says he’s “definitely” staying at Dundee to help them pick up the wins to put their poor start to the season behind them.The Finnish international has been the subject of plenty of speculation over the summer with clubs like Swansea and Wolves credited with an interest and  Sunderland having made an enquiry over his availability.With the English transfer window having shut, the number of clubs able to stump up the transfer fee to prise away the Dark Blues’ prize asset has dwindled.And that’s good news for fans at Dens Park as the team have struggled in recent weeks with Kamara stuck in the treatment room with a troublesome ankle problem.He said: “I’ll definitely be here at the end of the month, 100%.“I want to stay and play games, win games and that’s the plan.“Hopefully, I can help the team do that.“It’s been difficult sitting on the sidelines – I’ve hated every minute of it watching from the stands!“Hopefully, I’m back into it soon, I’m feeling fit.”Kamara made his return to action under testing circumstances.The midfielder came on seconds after Sofien Moussa’s dismissal with his side a goal down to Ayr United.And things got even worse as the Honest Men knocked in another two goals to seal their place in the last eight of the Betfred Cup.Looking back at an abject team display, Kamara was almost lost for words.He did, though, find these ones: “Where do you start?“We knew Ayr would be a decent team and have some decent players, they’d be organised and difficult to beat so it wasn’t a surprise.“All the boys were second best on Saturday. We’ve got to give Ayr some credit but the defeat was down to us. We weren’t at it at all.“We knew their qualities and had watched them so it wasn’t about under-estimating them.“We just didn’t create enough and were second best for the whole game.“It might be a lesson for some of the new guys, the league is tough and you need to be ready every game.“I don’t even know what to say, to be honest – it’s a hard one to take and we have to pick ourselves up for a big game this weekend at St Johnstone.“We need three points there.”Focus turns completely to the league campaign now after the Betfred Cup disappointment and what has now become a huge game at St Johnstone.The Dark Blues picked up three wins from four against their Tayside rivals last campaign, including a much-needed first victory of the season.That came in mid-September – this time around Kamara is keen to help the side repeat that 3-2 victory by grabbing a first three points of the season.He added: “Hopefully we can repeat that.“We’ll just do our stuff on the training pitches for the week coming up and put our attention now on St Johnstone but we definitely have to look back on the game on Saturday, we can’t just forget about that performance.“There are always other games and it’s a long season ahead but it’s really hard to go out of the cup like that.“We’re always after a cup run so it’s a tough one to take.“We have to pick ourselves up but I know this team is capable of doing that.“We played some good football in the games before Ayr so we know what we are capable of.“The results haven’t gone our way, though, and it’s obvious Saturday just wasn’t good enough from us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ive loved every second and now i want more dan","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDan Jefferies “loved every second” of his first-team chance last season and has vowed to grab any chance he gets this campaign with both hands.The 19-year-old featured in the two final home matches of last season, as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Hamilton before starting the home defeat to Partick Thistle that concluded the campaign.The Welshman, who started his career in Swansea’s youth academy, joined the Dark Blues in January after leaving Colchester United and impressed in the U/20s team that narrowly missed out on the Development League title.He also grabbed a goal in last week’s Irn-Bru Cup win over Hibs Colts for the Dundee youth side and says he thinks he’s ready for another shot at first-team football.Though, he admits jokingly, he might have to calm himself next time he’s out on the pitch in the senior game.Describing his time in the first team last season, he said: “I loved every second of it – once you step on that pitch everything is mad, it’s crazy and you don’t know what to do!“You need to calm yourself down a bit but I’m buzzing to have played for the first team and, hopefully, I can get more chances this season.“I think I’m ready to make the step up.“With the players in front of me in my position, I’m always learning from them, they are always helping me and everyone around the training ground is helping me.“If I do get a chance this year, I’ll give my all and I think I am ready for it – I’ll definitely take it with both hands and I won’t look back.”As a centre-back, Jefferies certainly has plenty of competition to get through ahead of him.As far as central defenders go, the Dark Blues boast an array of experience – Steven Caulker being an England international and former Liverpool and Spurs defender, Darren O’Dea won numerous trophies at Celtic, Josh Meekings is a Scottish Cup winner and Genseric Kusunga has two Swiss league titles to his name.For Jefferies, that doesn’t pose an insurmountable hurdle but rather gives him an ideal opportunity to learn from players who have been there and done it.He added: “In training if you make a mistake, they don’t really get on to you, they encourage more than anything.“They want everyone to improve every day and because I’m young, I’m 19, I look up to the likes of Steven Caulker, Darren O’Dea, Josh Meekings and Gense – I mean, they’ve got some amount of experience.“I hope they can share it with me and I can move on with them.”After making the move north, Jefferies has settled into

repaired next year.The Old Aberdeen community previously hit out at the eyesore repairs undertaken to a section of the cobbled High Street.The works, at College Bounds and High Street, were undertaken by Aberdeen City Council in May this year, to improve safety in the area where there were sections of missing stones.It emerged that to make the repairs, it would cost Aberdeen City Council more than £100,000, which the local authority said could not be accommodated within the current financial year’s budget.The Old Aberdeen Community Council, alongside councillors, wrote to the local authority urging officers to take urgent remedial action, with Councillor Alexander McLellan even writing to outside bodies in a bid to secure the funding that was needed to carry out the repairs.At a meeting of the Old Aberdeen Community Council on Tuesday evening, a roads officer revealed that a source of funding has now been identified, and that it is hoped work will be carried out in the spring.Transport spokesman at Aberdeen City Council and ward councillor for Old Aberdeen, Ross Grant, said: “When there is a defect in the cobbles the problem can become a domino effect if it’s not dealt with.“The council officers said that 70 metres of the road will be reconditioned – where the cobbles will be taken up and relayed in the full and proper way.”Repairs were carried out after a member of the public tripped on the cobblestones and reported it to the council.The problem was classified as a category two defect by safety inspectors and, as a result, the repairs had to be carried out within a week.Pouring tarmac on the road was deemed the fastest way to temporarily repair the area without damaging the cobblestones.To fully repair the road, it will take six to eight weeks, followed by a further four weeks to cure.Mr Grant added: “The work the council is carrying out is to repair the road as properly as they can.“As an administration, we are committed to seeing the works through and keeping the community involved.”Utilities companies need to be given three months’ statutory notice to plan work, which made an immediate permanent fix earlier this year unfeasible.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"first pupils set foot in new aberdeen school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe first intake of schoolchildren have started at Lochside Academy.The school, which was

cruises, golf, culture and heritage, food and drink and touring.In a report to councillors, the strategy calls for a compelling shore excursion programme that would appeal to cruise passengers as well

The strategy has a lot of information on what we want to be able to do.”Fellow committee members echoed Mr Argyle’s praise for the new strategy including vice-chairmen John Cox and councillor George Carr.Mr Carr said: “Tourism is a broad subject and it includes the whole of Aberdeenshire.“We need to work with groups to make the experience of the north-east better.“I think we have a long way to go with this but I do welcome this.”Councillor Paul Johnston asked members of the committee for a further report into the sustainability of action plans when they are written.He said: “I do feel that Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire and other bodies have sometimes been out of step with each other and it is good to see we are going in the right direction with the strategy.“I would ask for a further report on each of the different action plans before we as a council commit to any funding.“I believe this would allow us to see the best value for money with each of the action plans and the strategy sustainability.”Councillors approved the strategy unanimously.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east housebuilder refused planning permission after council discover unauthorised quarrying","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRetrospective planning permission for extraction of soil and stone at a north-east business has been refused by councillors.Neil Murray Housebuilders had submitted the application to Aberdeenshire Council earlier this year for the site at Forglen, near Turriff.The plans came after an investigation by the council’s planning enforcement team that found out unauthorised quarrying operations were taking place at the site.It is estimated that around 1,500 tonnes of material has already been extracted from the site.A motion to approve the application was put forward by Councillor John Cox which was seconded by Councillor Colin Pike.An amendment to refuse the proposals was proposed by Councillor Robbie Withey and seconded by Councillor Mark Findlater.The amendment was passed eight votes to six.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east service for vulnerable adults gets top marks from inspectors","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA support service for vulnerable adults in the north-east has been awarded top marks by inspectors for helping them make friends.Monitors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Aberdeenshire Council Shared Lives Scheme’s adult placement programme and rated it “excellent” the best of six possible ratings – a rating rarely given.Based at Viewmount on Arduthie Road, Stonehaven, the service arranges for vulnerable adults to live with families and receive personal care, support or counselling either on a temporary or permanent basis.At the time of the inspection the scheme had 20 sets of carers and 26 service users.The report said: “The service achieved an excellent standard.

He’s a genius, he scored their 5,000th goal nine years ago and it was simply unthinkable that anyone else would create this amazing landmark. (NB, just in case you’re wondering, Messi has either scored or made 476 of those 1,000 goals since the defeat of Racing Santander in 2009).His free kicks are legendary. Last season he hit an all-time high for converting them and, largely, he’ll thrash the ball into the postage stamp between post and crossbar.Thus the players in the wall jump. Of course they do. Anything to try to deflect his free-kick over. So \u0026#8230 every so often he cheekily slots a daisy cutter under their collective leap and, really, it’s quite impossible to stop.It’s a part of his game that I love. But it’s not often spoken about.What I mean is that long ago, in the first interview he gave me, Autumn 2006, Messi made it clear to me that his enjoyment of football doesn’t extend to watching much (in fact any) of it when he’s off duty.You won’t catch him, unlike Xavi for example, watching Serie B, Stoke trying to get out of the Championship or Aberdeen at Hibs in the League Cup.However, Messi does think about the game. Particularly about penalties and free kicks.He’ll plan, he’ll remember particularly keepers, what he did to them last time, he’ll stack up information in that massively rapid circuit board in his brain – he calculates. Last season, in Spring, he scored four free-kicks in a six-game spree.And he did the same to Girona, the sneaky daisy-cutter, as he pulled off at the weekend to break Alavés’ resistance.What I like most about it is the feeling that it’s, momentarily, like a high-stakes poker game, world title chess or that cool pub game, spoof. Most of the time this wonderful footballer uses technique, power \u0026#8230 shock and awe \u0026#8230 to beat opponents.But every so often, when they think they’ve worked out what he’s going to do, he out- psyches them. Whenever he pulls off that “under the wall” trick I’m telling you that there’s an extra, impish smile on his face as he celebrates.His other goal last weekend was brilliance personified. He hit the woodwork twice, he struck a free-kick off the bar last week in the Spanish Supercup against Sevilla which Gerard Piqué then converted – Messi is switched on. No question. Because Cristiano Ronaldo has left? Because Messi’s been made captain? No \u0026#8230 it’s just what he does.“Genius” we legitimately call it, but what I also see is a guy who simply enjoys his massive talents to the maximum and for whom football has never ceased to be the all-time best legal high.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinallys men to go looking for revenge","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPeterhead boss Jim McInally says his League Two table-toppers will be using tomorrow’s match away to Stirling Albion to launch a “revenge mission”.The Blue Toon travel to Forthbank undefeated in the league with two wins and a draw from three fixtures.In contrast, the Binos have yet to get a point on the board.However, Albion have already beaten McInally’s men this term – getting a 2-0 win in the league cup at Balmoor – and McInally reckons this will have his team fired up.He said: “They’ve already beaten us at Peterhead a few weeks ago so it would be folly to think it would be anything other than a tough game.“They beat us well, they played well, we didn’t play particularly well that day.“We know it’s not a case of going in thinking we’ll win the game.“It’s a wee bit of a revenge mission for us, where we need to give them a wee bit of payback for coming up to Peterhead and beating us.“We’ll certainly be up for it and we won’t be underestimating them.”After that defeat, where Peterhead were sucker-punched twice on the counter-attack, McInally thought his young centre-backs, Jason Brown and Cameron Eadie, had been taught a lesson by Dave Mackay’s two centre-forwards.He has taken steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again, having been impressed with the pair in other matches.McInally said: “That was probably their worst game that day. Peter MacDonald and Mark Stewart, two experienced guys, gave them a bit of a lesson.“We’ll just prepare ourselves and try to change that mindset for them tomorrow.“The boys were terrific last week against (Clyde’s) David Goodwillie and Ally Love, so if we can stop that threat (we’ll be OK).“We just need to keep improving we’ve still got two defenders to come in.“The boys are doing well, we’ve got two wingers at full-back as well, but you’re never quite sure, if they come under pressure, how they’ll react.”McInally is pleased with his players’ start to the season but knows they need to keep improving to get up to League One this term, after last season’s near miss.In their last three, they’ve scored seven goals and only conceded once in wins over Albion Rovers, Brechin City and Clyde. They drew with Queen’s Park on opening day.McInally said: “We’re getting there. I don’t think we’re where we want to be yet.“Players will get fitter as the weeks go on, and players will get sharper and hopefully with the players we’ve got, if they can get into that condition and that sharpness, it bodes well for us to score more goals.“The cup game with Stirling, we made a lot of chances that day but just couldn’t score.“We’re pleased with the way it’s going but we’re still not where we want to be yet.”Injury-wise, Peterhead will only be missing new defenders Paddy Boyle and Mick Dunlop for the trip to Stirling.Both players are on their way back, with McInally saying he’s aiming to have them back for their Irn-Bru Challenge Cup tie with Irish side Bohemians at Balmoor on Saturday September 8.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/39910284_2087499311274972_4068059784295743488_n.jpg ","title":"dyce rugby club to celebrate 35th year with current team v old boys match","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDyce Rugby Club will kick-off their 35th season with a celebratory match tomorrow.The current team will meet a line-up made up from past teams to contest the Mark Cheyne Memorial Trophy.It’s hoped the old boys game will give Dyce’s 2018/19 squad a decent challenge ahead of their Caley North Division Four fixtures getting under way.Graeme Lowe, Dyce vice-captain, said: “I’m really looking forward to it.“It will be a great occasion and a tough test for the current team.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

This would ensure smaller productions are not unduly impacted.Councillor Aileen Morton, policy lead for economic development, said: \u0026#8216Clearly Argyll and Bute is very popular with film crews, from very small productions all the way up to films that will be seen on the big screen around the world.

Consistency, however, paid off for Inveraray as they were crowned Grade 1 Champion of Champions across all five major competitions during 2018 \u0026#8211 for the third year running.In Grade 4B, a young Mid Argyll Pipe Band kept up the momentum started in May when they won the British title.

Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new-galashiels-agency-searching-for-tv-and-film-extras","story":"A NEW Galashiels business hopes to give locals their big break, by becoming TV and film extras.\nFirefly Casting and Modelling Agency recently opened in the town\u0026rsquos Overhaugh Street, and as the film industry in Scotland continues to grow, the business aims to showcase the talent the Borders has to offer.\nThe new venture, which is taking on a variety of film/TV extras, models and musicians, has been set up by Angela Jewitt and Donna Cooper, both from Clovenfords.\nAngela previously worked as a TV extra for shows such as Inspector Morse, Minder and Coronation Street and has been involved with modelling for many years.

Scottish Borders Council calling for a rethink of its benefits assistance service.\nIn November 2017 the council merged the customer, homelessness, and welfare benefits services to become one integrated department.\nNow, a petition signed by over 200 Borders residents has been handed into Scottish Borders Council, urging the authority to employ officers with a specific remit to assist benefits claimants in applying for welfare. \u0026nbsp\nThe petition further calls on the council to \u0026ldquoensure there are sufficient staff resources within Scottish Borders Council for maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors of what people are facing at the moment, and hopefully persuade them to hire more people in the future to help people with filling in of forms and other admin.\n\u0026ldquoThe welfare benefits service was a much loved service which really helped people and the changes were made with no consultation whatsoever.\n\u0026ldquoWe are calling for them to consult with people who claim welfare benefits as to what is needed.\nCouncillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos audit and scrutiny committee will hear representations from the petition\u0026rsquos authors and from council officers on Thursday, before making a decision on whether to accept or reject the petition.\nAhead of the meeting, Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos service director for customers and communities has written to councillors urging them to take no further action.\nIn her statement, she said: \u0026ldquoThe aim of the restructure was to ensure that the level of service provided continued and in some areas improved, ensuring Scottish Borders Council was prepared for ongoing welfare reform including the rollout of universal credit.\n\u0026ldquoThe Department for Work and Pensions expectation on customers to self-serve online has created increased demands on Council services to assist customers.\n\u0026ldquoPrior to November 2017 the equivalent of 1.7 welfare benefit assistants were employed to assist with basic benefit enquiries including form filling with customers.\n\u0026ldquoWe now have 49 customer advice and support advisors across a wider range of locations, with a remit to assist customers at the first point of contact with their enquiry whether they present in a locality office face to face, over the telephone or online.\n\u0026ldquoThese advisers already deal with a range of benefit enquiries and applications as well as carrying out assessments for blue badges.\n\u0026ldquoThe aim is to provide a holistic service where a customer can speak to the same member of

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.  To the east, it comes into force as drivers make their way along the A1087."},{"url":null,"title":"your-chance-to-apply-for-thousands-of-pounds-of-support-for-your-charity","story":"  Last year, donations totalling almost \u0026pound300,000 were made up and down the country on behalf of Newsquest Media Group, one of the UK\u0027s largest publishers and owners of the East Lothian Courier.  The Gannett Foundation UK, which makes the grants, has given more than \u0026pound3 million to help charitable community causes all over Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the last 10 years.  One of the successful applicants last year was Lothian Autistic Society, which received \u0026pound5,000 for its East Lothian Basecamp service. This service supports children, aged 5-13, with autism and helps them develop social communication and social interaction skills through structured themed group and play sessions.  The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.  And it values projects that bring lasting benefits to local communities.  A spokesman said: \"While preference may be given to ideas which create a durable legacy for the community, judges will consider single events or projects of limited duration that otherwise meet the criteria.\"  Typically grants are made for substantial projects which require and merit awards of between \u0026pound5,000 and \u0026pound10,000, although applications can be for any size of grant and level of ambition.  The foundation will join with other contributors to support elements of larger projects, but prefers to be in a position of making a donation which will fund a project in its entirely or which constitutes the final instalment to complete a project.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations.

He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.

Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council (NBCC) contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band.

Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody!

He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance.

Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board\u0026nbsphas seen five times as many people diagnosed with syphilis in the last four months compared to same period last year.  Since April there have been 56 confirmed cases of the infection in\u0026nbspSwansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend \u0026ndash with 16 of those coming in the last two weeks alone.  Most of the patients have been men, but several women have also tested positive.  Doctors believe the reason behind the steep rise could be an increase in people using online dating apps like Tinder and Bumble to meet up for unprotected sex, then deleting their partners profiles afterwards, preventing them from warning them if they are diagnosed with an infection later on.  Symptoms for syphilis can include small painless sores or ulcers, blotchy red rashes, small skin growths or white patches in the mouth.  It may also cause tiredness, headaches, joint pains and swollen glands, but\u0026nbspsome people may experience no symptoms at all.  If left untreated the infection can spread to the brain or other parts of the body, causing serious and long-term problems.  The health board, in South Wales, are urging people to contact sexual health clinic if they have had unprotected sex in recent months.  ABMU sexual health lead nurse Joanne Hearne said: \u0026ldquoThere has been an increase in syphilis generally across Wales.  \u0026ldquoBut we have seen a significant rise across the health board area, particularly over the last six weeks.  \u0026ldquoIt is possible that the heatwave earlier in the summer led to people becoming more sexually active.  \u0026ldquoWe also believe social media and the growth of dating websites and apps is another contributory factor.  Sexual health sister Carly Porter added: \u0026ldquoWe have found that some diagnosed patients find it a lot more difficult to contact previous sexual partners as they have met them through a dating app. In some cases, they may have then deleted their profile.  \u0026ldquoAs a result, many people may be unaware they have the infection."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/7067548.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"alex-salmond-harassment-allegations-nicola-sturgeon-reacts","story":"  The First Minister issued a statement following the revelations the Mr Salmond was the subject of two complaints that were investigated by the Scottish Government.

Ms Sturgeon said she agreed to the procedure covering ministers and former ministers in December 2017 but that while she was aware of the investigation she had no role in it.

That is clearly of benefit to the Scottish Government because any mass exodus would not only prove hugely embarrassing, it would also make the whole process of testing in P1 rather pointless.  What remains to be seen is how parents and schools interpret the phrase.  In 2016 John Swinney, the Education Secretary, allowed schools to use a form of internal assessment called units to give pupils a safety net \u0026ldquoin exceptional circumstances.  In fact, the instruction was comprehensively ignored and some 10,000 pupils were awarded National 4 qualifications as a result of passing the unit assessments.  It remains to be seen whether the current campaign to encourage parents to opt out of the P1 tests will have the desired affect.  Despite concerns over the distress caused to some pupils, other schools have reported no such issues.  However, should parents want to opt out in significant numbers, even after discussing the issue with schools, is it the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos expectation that headteachers will ignore them?  That would be counterproductive to the sort of positive community relations schools are trying to foster.

He also revealed the UK Government was updating its no-deal analysis ahead of the key Commons vote on the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos final Brexit agreement.  This will be seen by Brexiteers as a blatant attempt to scare MPs into forcing through her Chequers compromise.  Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos Remainer colleague Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, said the Chancellor had \u0026ldquoconfirmed the Government forecasts a disastrous hit to our economy and living standards in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The Treasury\u0026rsquos original analysis, published in January, calculated a no-deal Brexit would cost the UK economy as much as 10 per cent of GDP, leading to \u0026pound80 billion a year in extra borrowing by 2033 with possible additional tax rises and spending cuts.  As the Government published the first in a series of technical notices aimed at advising the public, official bodies and businesses on how to prepare for a no-deal, the Brexit Secretary suggested the \"vast majority\" of consumers would not notice its impact.  He sought to debunk no-deal scare stories, telling journalists: \"Let me assure you, contrary to one of the wilder claims, you will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the Army to maintain food supplies.\"  However First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"A \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo Brexit would be an unmitigated disaster \u0026ndash and the fact that UK govt is even talking about it is evidence of their abject failure. That they once had the nerve to tell us that independence threatened our place in Europe adds insult to injury. Scotland deserves better.\"  While Mr Raab, a Brexiteer, admitted failing to secure agreement with Brussels on the UK\u0026rsquos withdrawal posed \"short-term risks,\" he argued Britain in the long run would be better off.  While he expressed confidence a \u0026ldquogood deal is within our sights, the Secretary of State nonetheless insisted contingency planning for a no-deal was prudent and responsible.  But Labour\u0026rsquos Sir Keir Starmer said the Conservative Government\u0026rsquos approach was \u0026ldquothin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to mitigate the serious consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement.  His colleague Chris Leslie, the former Shadow Chancellor, speaking on behalf of the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign, said: \u0026ldquoOn the same day the Brexit Secretary was desperately trying to play down the risks of no-deal, the Chancellor has fired off a Brexit bazooka by admitting it would mean \u0026pound80bn in extra borrowing or cuts each year by 2033.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis Government is being pulled apart at the seams by Brexit but it\u0026rsquos the country that will ultimately pay the price when it all falls apart.  Ms Morgan noted: \u0026ldquoIt is clear the Government\u0026rsquos mantra that \u0026lsquono deal is better than a bad deal\u0026rsquo is dead in the water and that no deal is in fact a very, very bad deal.  The developments came as David Lidington, Mrs May\u0026rsquos effective deputy, on a visit to Scotland, insisted a no-deal scenario would not threaten the Union and suggested the deadline for securing agreement with Brussels might be pushed back from the European Council in mid-October to as late as December.  The Government papers declared: \"People and businesses should not be alarmed by no-deal planning and preparation nor read into it any pessimism. Instead they should be reassured we are taking a responsible approach, ensuring the UK\u0027s exit can be as smooth as possible in all scenarios\".  Yet they also said a no-deal could mean consumers facing:  *higher costs, from goods to holidays, due to a \"likely increase\" in the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU because cross-border payments would no longer be covered by an EU-wide \"surcharging ban,\" which prevents businesses adding an extra levy when consumers pay  *price increases when shopping online with parcels arriving in the UK no longer liable for the EU\u0026rsquos Low Value Consignment Relief on VAT and  *many of the 900,000 ex-pats living across the EU might not be able to access their British pensions as they \u0026ldquomay lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts [such as life insurance contracts and annuities] due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA\".  Helen Dickinson for the British Retail Consortium, said the no-deal notices pointed to \u0026ldquoreduced availability and higher prices of food and medicine, increased delays and red tape at borders, and a VAT bombshell for consumers and businesses."},{"url":null,"title":"tory-hq-blocks-leaveeu-arron-bankss-application-to-join-conservative-party","story":"  The move comes just days after some Tories warned about entryism by ex-Ukippers, who might attempt to join the party to swing any future leadership contest in favour of a hard Right pro-Brexit candidate.  Lord Hague, the former party leader, urged the Tories to reject proposals to give party members more choice in future leadership contests as the idea, favoured by supporters of Boris Johnson, could give Corbyn-like influence to \u0026ldquounrepresentative minorities and reduce the chances of the party selecting a leader with widespread appeal.  Arron Banks, the multimillionaire founder of the Brexit campaign, and Andrew Wigmore, his spin doctor, announced on social media that they had joined the Conservatives.  Both have close ties with Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, and have styled themselves as the \"Bad Boys of Brexit\".  Mr Banks recently encouraged Leave.EU supporters to join the Tories to have a say in any forthcoming leadership battle, claiming such a contest was likely within the next three to six months, and thereby determining the type of Brexit pursued by the UK Government.  However, Tory HQ dismissed the Brexiteers\u0026rsquo claims.  A Conservative Party spokesman said: \"Arron Banks and Andrew Wigmore\u0027s applications for membership of the Conservative Party have not been approved.\"  Mr Banks reacted by tweeting: \"That\u0027s strange because I had a nice welcome letter from [Conservative Party chairman] @BrandonLewis this morning saying you are now activated and welcome to attend any event.\"  He and Mr Wigmore said in an article for the former\u0026rsquos Westmonster news website that the battle for Brexit was \u0026ldquonow within the Conservative Party\" and any upcoming leadership election, hence their decision to seek membership.  Mr Banks said: \"Most of our members are proper conservatives that believe in immigration control, family values, self-reliance and prudent management of the economy. My Conservative Party membership lapsed in 2013 and I today joined the party.\"  He later tweeted Tory Remainers Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan saying: \"Play nicely we are family now! Richard Tice makes three out of the four bad boys of Brexit now Conservative members...only Nigel Farage left.\"  Mr Banks was asked on Twitter whether he would attend the upcoming Tory conference, to which he replied: \"Why not?\".  Mr Wigmore, also speaking to Westmonster, said: \"Like thousands of other Brexit supporters I\u0027ve rejoined the Conservative Party to ensure that if there is a leadership contest, then I can influence the type of leader the country and the Tory Party need.  \"We need a Brexit leader, one who believes in Brexit and will deliver what 17.4 million people voted for.  He added: \u0026ldquoA strong Tory membership is essential to hold the leadership and MPs to account.

Martin Whitfield, the Labour MP for East Lothian, has been a vocal supporter of the public having a say on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  In May, he and former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, signed up to the idea, putting them at odds with Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos policy of honouring the Leave vote.  Edinburgh South Labour MP Ian Murray and MEP Catherine Stihler also backed the idea.  Mr Gray, His party\u0027s education spokesman, said he put great store in MPs having a \u0026ldquomeaningful vote on the deal, but also favoured a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  He told The Herald: \u0026ldquoIt looks increasing like any deal that there is - if there is any deal - is going to be a pretty poor one and that seems a reasonable thing to give the public.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot get me wrong. I believe the meaningful vote in parliament is key as well. But I think that having the People\u0026rsquos Vote as a possibility is an important one too.  Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer yesterday said a new referendum on a final Brexit deal should be \u0026ldquoon the table and \u0026ldquoall options left open given the volatility of the issue.  He also dismissed comments from his shadow cabinet colleague Barry Gardiner that a second referendum could lead to \u0026ldquocivil disobedience.  Scottish LibDem MSP Tavish Scott, whose party supports a People\u0026rsquos Vote, said he hoped more senior Labour figures followed Mr Gray\u0027s lead.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad Iain Gray has backed the campaign to give the British people the final say on Brexit.

The last major new venue to be built was the Traverse Theatre in the early 1990s. Edinburgh is believed to miss out on many major touring acts because it does not have enough medium-sized venues.  Dubbed the Impact Centre, the concert hall will become the permanent home of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra but will also boast a 200-seat studio and a large entrance hall and foyer.  Chairman of the venture, Sir Ewan Brown \u0026ndash former chair of Creative Scotland and Lloyds TSB Scotland \u0026ndash said a new, mid-sized music venue for the capital has been is long overdue and would be transformational for its arts scene.  \u0026ldquoThere has been a perception that this is just for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, but it is for all kinds of music, he said.  \u0026ldquoThey will play their concert a week, and they will be using the rehearsal facilities, but it will also be for rock and pop, for Celtic and traditional music, for choral and classical music.  \u0026ldquoAnd unlike the Usher Hall, we will be open all day \u0026ndash it will a community, welcoming space, and we envisage a musical performance in the foyer, everything from buskers to choirs, there will be something there every day.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe know there are music promoters who are not coming to the city because there is no mid-sized hall. So we are excited about that.  Sir Ewan said the project had \u0026ldquoall the elements are in place to seize the opportunity to put Edinburgh back on the world stage as a top music destination.  And he added: \u0026ldquoWe believe we now have a building designed to attract performers and audiences of all ages, backgrounds and interests, to a bustling, all-day public space where everyone feels welcome, in a building to be proud of.  The expectation is the Impact Centre will become will be a key component of the Edinburgh International Festival, and could also be used by the Edinburgh International Book Festival, which is based at the other end of George Street, in Charlotte Square.  Trustees of the scheme include Fergus Linehan, director of the Edinburgh International Festival, as well as Karine Polwart, the acclaimed singer songwriter, and James Naughtie, journalist and writer.  Project architect Sir David Chipperfield said: \u0026ldquoSeeing Edinburgh at the height of the festivals reinforces just how much the new venue will contribute to the cultural life of the city, during summer and all year round.  \u0026ldquoThe challenge of creating a modern performance space in the heart of the historic New Town has been stimulating and the quality of public engagement with the process has contributed greatly to the design of this much needed new music venue in Edinburgh.  The Royal Bank of Scotland has donated the land to the Impact Centre, which will replace an existing office building, on an 120-year- lease.  Around \u0026pound10m needs to be raised from private sponsorship and other sources to fund the construction of the building, which has also been given \u0026pound10m from the Dunard Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"netflix-acquires-us-rights-for-the-great-british-bake-off","story":"  Last year\u0026rsquos series, the first to feature new hosts Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding and judge Prue Leith, will be made available on the streaming service on August 31.

Aberdeen received a customer satisfaction score of 49% while Edinburgh Airport \u0026ndash Scotland\u0026rsquos largest \u0026ndash scored 59%.

Within a few years his left-wing views saw him play a prominent role in the breakaway faction known as the \u0026ldquo79 Group \u0026ndash with Mr Salmond expelled by nationalists for a short while for his involvement.  Graduating with a degree in economics and history, he worked as an economist for both the Government Economic Service and the Royal Bank of Scotland before going to Westminster in 1987.  He became leader of the party for the first time in 1990 and when the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999 he also held a seat there, becoming MSP for Banff and Buchan.  He served as leader of the opposition at Holyrood, while retaining his seat at Westminster, but he stood down as SNP leader in 2000 and left the Scottish Parliament in 2001.  In 2007 he returned to the Edinburgh parliament, not just as the MSP for Gordon but as the new First Minister.  After\u0026nbspthe SNP won an unprecedented overall majority at Holyrood in 2011, he led the Yes campaign in the independence referendum in 2014.  However, the result \u0026ndash a 55% to 45% vote to stay in the UK \u0026ndash led to his resignation on September 19 and his\u0026nbspdeputy Nicola Sturgeon took the helm as SNP leader and First Minister by November.  Those who thought he would step back from frontline politics were mistaken, with Mr Salmond announcing his intention to return to Westminster by standing in the 2015 general election.  In May 2015 he became the new MP for Gordon, overturning decades of Liberal Democrat rule. He returned to the House of Commons, standing down as an MSP at the 2016 Scottish elections.

The Scottish Government refutes his criticisms of its process and will defend its position vigorously.  \u0026ldquoHowever, this focus on process cannot deflect from the fact that complaints were made that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.  \u0026ldquoI have been clear on many occasions that all organisations and workplaces must make it possible for people to come forward to report concerns and have confidence that they will be treated seriously.  \u0026ldquoFor that principle to mean anything it cannot be applied selectively.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Friday 24 Aug 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Friday 24 Aug 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald (vice-chairman), Catherine Patterson (secretary) and Garance Warburton (treasurer).Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Friday 24 Aug 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm.

She has it all.\"I would definitely say she is the best that I have ever had.\"She has strong flat bones in her legs, the hock is nice and high in her hind legs, her second thigh is nice and short, and she has a good deep body and good long silky hair covering her legs and the back of her hooves.\"And she\u0026rsquos good natured too, they generally are.\"The plant fitter, who works for Macdonald Groundworks, has been breeding his own Clydesdale horses for more than 30 years, following in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather, Donald Clarke, who worked on farms with the horses and took a stallion around the area.Mr Johnstone said: \"We also have Ord Tinkerbell\u0026rsquos full sister Ord Destiny and her mother Ord Envy.\"We keep them on a bit of rented ground.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Friday 24 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre.

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff.

He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider variety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Friday 24 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The world of Scottish politics was rocked late last night with the news that complaints of misconduct had been made against Alex Salmond relating to his time in office as First Minister.

The Permanent Secretary of the Scottish Government, Leslie Evans, said that she informed Mr Salmond of the claims against him in March, and by this Wednesday was preparing to make the complaints public. READ MORE: Alex Salmond: The full statement from permanent secretary on harassment allegationsLegal Response The former First Minister revealed in a statement late last night that he has been battling Ms Evans on the nature of the complaints procedure that has been applied to the allegations against him.             He labelled the procedure ‘unjust’ and said that Leslie Evans was acting ‘unlawfully’, while announcing that he had launched a Judicial Review at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to determine whether the complaints procedure is lawful. Scottish Government statementIn a statement announced earlier, Leslie Evans claimed that Mr Salmond’s statement “contains significant inaccuracies which will be addressed in those court proceedings.” She added: “The Scottish Government will defend its position vigorously.”Ms Evans also confirmed that a separate legal action by Mr Salmond had stopped her from making public the complaints but noted that the ex-MSP had dropped those proceedings.             First Minister’s response In a statement released minutes ago, Mr Salmond’s successor as First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed that she had been aware of the allegations against the Former First Minister for some time.Ms Sturgeon said that she was first made aware of the allegations by Mr Salmond himself.

Smart Metering Systems (SMS), which connects, owns, operates and maintains energy metering assets and databases, has inked the tie-up with renewable energy supplier Good Energy.            Good Energy, based in Wiltshire, has more than 250,000 customers across the UK, adding to the 2 million-plus customers already served by SMS.             Under the terms of the agreement, SMS will supply domestic smart meters as part of the UK government’s rollout programme, which requires that domestic energy supply companies provide their customers with a smart meter to use in their homes and small businesses by 2020.SMS will provide new “SMETS 2” smart meters to monitor energy usage, which have a user-friendly advantage over the previous SMETS 1 model, as they allow customers to switch suppliers without changing meters. The majority of smart meters soon to be installed under the main phase of the government’s rollout scheme will be SMETS 2.  Alan Foy, chief executive officer at SMS, which is quoted on the alternative investment market (AIM), said: “We are delighted to be working with Good Energy as their exclusive supplier, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of energy from renewable sources, in the rollout of their smart meter programme. “Good Energy have over 250,000 customers across the UK, SMS is well positioned to support them with the smart meter rollout given our strong track record for customer services and asset ownership and management.”            John Maltby, Good Energy chairman, said the partnership would lead to a good user experience for the supplier’s customers. He said: “We are pleased to announce our partnership with SMS as the chosen supplier of our new SMETS 2 meters, as part of the UK government programme to roll out smart meters to UK energy customers.“Good Energy is focused on making sure smart meters work for the renewable energy sector. “Partnering with SMS gives us the ability to provide our customers with a market-leading smart meter, and associated products, which will enhance user experience.”            This is the latest deal for SMS, which signed a meter rental agreement in February with Utilita Energy to provide more than 100,000 meters throughout the year.The firm in March upped its dividend by more than a quarter despite a dip in pre-tax profits.

Going behind the scenes is one of the great privileges of being a journalist.             I’ve been lucky enough to be shown round many extraordinary places that are off limits to the public, from airport runways to the top of the Forth Bridge.            However, once a year, hundreds of normally closed buildings across Scotland are opened for people to have a peek inside.Launched nearly 30 years ago as part of Glasgow’s year as European City of Culture in 1990, Doors Open Days (DOD) now describes itself as Scotland’s biggest free festival, generating 200,000 annual visits.DOD now provides not just access to 800 historic and architecturally notable buildings but a wide-ranging programme of guided tours and lectures, also all free.Over the years, I’ve looked inside many buildings in Edinburgh and Glasgow during DOD, joined fascinating tours of the Clyde and its bridges by bike and on foot.I’ve also been to lectures about Glasgow’s pioneering underground railways, visited former shipyards and the city’s oldest railway station building – the 170-year-old Pollokshaws West.            Of course, there are myriad other sites on offer by DOD over several weekends next month, a different one for each part of the country.READ MORE: Alastair Dalton: Experts reveal Scotland’s transport heaven – and hellThey include everything from private swimming baths and sheriff courts to breweries and an animal hospital.However, for those interested in how we get about, there are some 20 buildings and events connected with transport in Glasgow alone, and at least seven in Edinburgh, with the capital’s DOD events programme to follow.            Elsewhere, you can visit a newly installed train turntable at a railway heritage centre in Aberdeen, HMS Unicorn – Scotland’s oldest ship – in Dundee, and the construction site of a £35 million road in Perth, the new A9/A85 link.Edinburghers will have their first chance to enter the Edinburgh Trams nerve centre, at its depot in Gogar.Also on show will be Lothian Buses’ headquarters off Leith Walk, which are nearly a century old, and the Northern Lighthouse Board’s offices in George Street, which are approaching their 200th anniversary.There’s also a shed in Leith where the last shipbuilding at the historic port ended in 1984 after 500 years, and a bunker in Barnton from where RAF fighter attacks were co-ordinated during the Second World War.In Glasgow, I’m looking forward to hearing about the city’s roads from prehistoric times to the M8, and prospects for walking improvements, while you could also be shown round the radical Avenues project to widen pavement and cycle lanes on several major city centre streets and also create a new “Underline” route beneath the motorway.

So the exam results have arrived and throughout Scotland young people are rejoicing or apologising or complaining or crying or ... drinking, according to what was in their text message or their email or the certificate dropped off by the carrier pigeon.             Their parents will be doing the same – gasping with relief, full of pride or on the bus to lodge the appeals and ... drinking. My Higher results were handed to me in Kirkliston in 1974 by our postwoman, Mrs Arbuckle. She was a friend of my mother and she stood there for a minute, half hoping, I think, to watch me open the big brown envelope but I didn’t give her that satisfaction. Anyway, they were fine and I was glad, and amid all the discussion of grade inflation, standards dropping, paying for university and finding a job, let’s just pause and wish all this year’s exam candidates well for the future, remembering our own disappointment, terror, satisfaction or joy.            However, let’s also ask a question – why do some young people pass exams and others fail them? Here are possible answers in no particular order: a, some young people are taught the subject better than others: yes! b, ome young people are taught more about exam technique: yes! c, some young people work harder than others: yes! d, s a means of assessment, exams suit some people more than others – yes! e, some young people choose their courses better than others and get more help in so doing: yes! f, some young people come from socially disadvantaged households where education is considered less of a priority: yes! g, some young people’s parents spend a shedload of money on tutoring: yes! h, some young people have specific learning difficulties which are not properly recognised and are thus disadvantaged in exams: yes! i, some young people have to deal with difficult pastoral issues in the run up to exams: yes!And no doubt  j, k, l etc etc can also reasonably apply. Of course, there’s one answer missing: some young people are more intelligent than others.Now, before you set off to firebomb my lovely home, let me make a comment or two. Firstly, I know we are only talking about one form of intelligence, what for the sake of the argument I will call ‘academic intelligence’ – and I know there are lots of others ‘intelligences’ and secondly I know that all these other factors listed above really matter. READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: Why we must radically rethink education            However, we do seem to have reached a point where talking about how ‘clever’ a child is has gone out of fashion to the point of political incorrectness. Now this causes two problems, the major one being that it enables those who plan our curricula to get away with making much the same offer to all our young people – a ‘level playing field’ argument, when in fact some young people are much more able to play that game from the outset because of their brains. Actually, what we should be doing is following the model of many other countries – say, for example, Germany – in accepting that different children have different skills and abilities, and widely differing levels of ‘academic’ intelligence and building school courses (and schools) accordingly. To many this may seem old-fashioned and reactionary but to many it’s just common sense. In education, one size does not fit all. One way of combating this would be to stop measuring the success of secondary schools in terms of how many pupils gain university entrance.Additionally, this state of affairs makes it very hard to explain with any honesty why one child does better than another – teachers, parents and pupils get caught up in a mire of excuse-making. It also underplays the huge successes of less able pupils who do relatively well through conscientiousness, good teaching and the support of teachers and families.            READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertSo, we need to talk more about intelligence and accept that it matters and we need to take a much wider view of our young people and what they can achieve. This is not an easy thing to do, and it’s always been difficult, as I found out at a very early stage in my career.A long time ago, in a school in the faraway North (of Edinburgh) I had, in my Higher English class, a boy whom I will call Angus – a name his parents may have considered. Angus was new into the school, and was a great boy – kind, cheerful, hard-working. He became popular very quickly because he liked everybody, was quite sporty, wholly lacked conceit and was polite and respectful to teachers in a very genuine way. He did his Higher English prelim and he failed it and then we had parents’ night.So I am sitting with his mum and dad, and this was in the days before (heaven forfend) the students themselves came to meetings, a step which, of course, made them infinitely more useful. I begin by praising Angus as a model of decency, maturity and hard work. I suggest that they should be really proud of Angus, and, shyly, these nice people concurred. And then I carry on: “So as regards the prelim, he demonstrated real progress and I think, if his attitude to work carries on like it is, he will pass at the end of the day.”“Why did he fail the prelim?” asks his mother.             “He finds some of the work quite difficult,” I say, “but he’s trying very hard.”“Maybe he needs to do some extra work?” she responds.“He already is.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

In July last year, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox was still insisting a trade deal between the UK and EU would be “one of the easiest in human history”, a common theme of the Leave referendum campaign. Fox recently revised his thinking, estimating there was a 60-40 chance of a no-deal Brexit after complaining bitterly that the European Union was putting “political ideology” before the lives of ordinary people.            However, as the UK Government yesterday laid out some of its contingency plans and advice for businesses about a no-deal scenario, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab adopted a radically different tone. There was no Brussels bashing instead he spoke of “our EU friends” and stressed that, even if the negotiations failed, “we would continue to behave as a responsible European neighbour, partner and ally”.            So Raab clearly has an idea of the sort of tone it is wise to adopt when attempting to reach an agreement with someone, particularly from a position of weakness.READ MORE: What would a ‘no deal’ Brexit look like?He said he was “still confident that getting a good deal is, by far, the most likely outcome” and that this was “our top priority ... our overriding priority”, but the UK Government did have to plan for the “unlikely” event of a failure of the talks. The 24 documents published yesterday gave advice for a number of different economic sectors, including trade, farming, medicine and finance. Some of them were more useful than others.Firms in Northern Ireland were told, for example, that “if you trade across the land border, you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make”. Civil servants in Dublin may find themselves busy today, attempting to answer hypothetical questions. The advice published yesterday is likely to be the first of a whole slew of similar documents, all of which essentially tell the same story. And that is one which makes clear just how deeply embedded the UK has become within the EU and how difficult extracting ourselves is going to be.If we wrench ourselves out in one sudden movement, we are extremely likely to come to serious economic harm with a serious risk of an “unmitigated disaster”, to quote Nicola Sturgeon. If we are able to negotiate a careful, managed withdrawal, the damage will be less, but still the economy will suffer and the lives of Fox’s “ordinary people” will be worse.

University research            The UK Government has offered a guarantee to universities and research institutes receiving money through the Horizon 2020 programme, which has provided 4.6 billion euro to fund British research since 2014.            Existing research projects will not lose their funding - but the government admits that the situation is less clear in cases where British researchers are working with colleagues elsewhere in the EU.Those projects may no longer be eligible for funding from the UK, and may not meet Horizon 2020 rules, either.READ MORE: Holidaymakers and online shoppers to face higher costs under no deal BrexitOrganic foodOver a third of British lamb is exported to the EU, and organic farmers across the UK use European standards and labels to market their products on the continent. But in a no-deal Brexit, “UK organic operators would not be permitted to use the EU organic logo” even though the government says legal standard wouldn’t change.To have British exports recognised as organic products, “UK organic control bodies will need to apply to the European Commission,” one paper published today states. “Approval can take up to nine months, so we are exploring alternative approaches”.            The NFU has warned any interruption to trade on that scale would be devastating to organic farmers.TobaccoEU rules cover tobacco packaging including health warnings, and Brussels holds the copyright over the grisly images of lung and throat cancers that are currently printed on packs of cigarettes and tobacco. The UK would need to have its own warnings ready for Brexit deal under a no-deal scenario.READ MORE: Scotland faces ‘Brexit nightmare’ warns Mike RussellCard payments            The UK would suddenly find itself outside of EU-wide banking infrastructure known as TARGET2 in a no-deal Brexit. As a result, customers and businesses “could face increased costs and slower processing times for euro transactions”, the government warns.For everyone buying a product or service from an EU-based company, “the cost of card payments between the UK and EU will likely increase” - so most costs associated with a foreign holiday in Europe.In addition, a ban on card surcharges introduced by Brussels in January of this year would no longer apply to payments to EU companies - so there would be no way to block Ryanair, which is based in Dublin, from reintroducing its controversial 2% credit card fee, for instance.Financial servicesLondon is Europe’s leading financial services hub, with the international banks and investment houses based there working for clients across the EU. They could struggle to do so after a no-deal Brexit, because ‘passporting’ rights for service companies within the single market will end, and no new agreement will replace them.            “In the absence of EU action, EEA clients will no longer be able to use the services of UK-based investment banks, and UK based investment banks may be unable to service cross border contracts,” the government admits, by way of an example. “UK authorities are not able through unilateral action to fully address risks to the EEA customers of UK firms currently providing services into the EEA.”The government says it would seek a standalone agreement on financial services after a no-deal Brexit, but many companies have already moved to set up subsidiaries in the EU to get around any new barriers.READ MORE: Catherine Stihler: No-deal Brexit will blight Britain for decadesPensions for expatsOne group of British citizens living in the EU set to be hit the hardest under a no-deal Brexit are pensioners, who are likely to rely on British banks and investment companies to provide much if not all of their income.Documents state that \"in the absence of action from the EU, EEA-based customers of UK firms currently passporting into the EEA, including UK citizens living in the EEA, may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA\"Fertility treatmentThe UK imported around 3,000 sperm samples from Denmark, and small amounts from other EU countries, for research and fertility treatments.Organisations would need to reach written agreements with sperm banks supplying samples to be able to continue imports, which the government says would “for the most part be a minimum burden on industry”.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nFriday 24 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

The tourism industry’s treatment of seasonal workers has also come under the spotlight in reports which island firms say has painted an unfair picture of local business.\nThe letter, which was co-ordinated by local MSP Kate Forbes and tourism promotional body SkyeConnect, said: “Nearly everybody on the islands is linked in some way to tourism, and the economic opportunities of the tourism industry support the rural and remote communities of Skye, Raasay and beyond.\n“The tourist industry can be a relatively unpredictable industry and so it concerns us to see sensationalist stories in the national press, for a second year running, which could jeopardise the jobs, businesses and income of local people.\n“We would hate to see an industry which has taken many years to develop undermined by a few stories which don’t fairly depict the efforts of hardworking people across the area.”\nThe letter also backs recent investment in infrastructure at some of Skye’s most popular sites.\nIt adds: “The Isle of Skye and Raasay, like many areas of the Highlands and Islands, is home to communities whose future is dependent on good jobs, steady incomes and business opportunities. Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"highland exodus to stirling as runrig get set for final","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nAfter 45 years, Runrig will bring the curtain down on a remarkable musical career this weekend when they play their last ever shows.\nAn exodus of west Highland and islanders will be among the throng at Stirling’s City Park in the shadow of the town’s famous castle this Friday and Saturday.\nThey will be there to enjoy and celebrate one final time with a band which owes its roots to Skye and North Uist, and became an international flag bearer for Gaeldom’s language and tradition.\nSpeaking to the Free Press ahead of the ‘Last Dance’ shows, guitarist Malcolm Jones said he held conflicting feelings but there was excitement none the less at a final performance which will chart over four decades of music.\nHe added: “I would say we’re all approaching these final concerts with mixed emotions. There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

At the same time, literally thousands of young Gaels have heard the irresistible rhythms of folk-rock in their native tongue and sung along with joy.\nWhatever your views on their music, the earliest band members\u0026#8217 personal appeal is and always has been irresistible.\nThe wry Highland modesty of Malcolm Jones, Donnie Munro and the heart and soul of the band, Calum and Rory MacDonald, is part of their great charm and an unacknowledged secret of their success. They still look like the boys from the dance hall, even though the boys are now virtuosos.\nGaelic was woven into every moment of Friday and Saturday nights, from the Glasgow Islay choir singing with Donnie Munro to Malcolm Jones being projected onto the walls of Stirling Castle riffing MacCrimmon\u0026#8217s Lament.\nMost people might not have been there for that. Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27433  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nWe all need to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadership and determination.\nLifelonganti-apartheid campaigner and veteran of the national liberation struggle inSouth Africa, Ronnie Kasrils was in Belfast and Derry recently to launch hisnew book ‘A Simple Man’.\nMartinMcAuley asked me to interview Ronnie for a Sinn Féinvideo.\nMy lastquestion was to ask what continues to inspire him and his vision for thefuture.\nHeexplained how much today’s youth inspire him, and in particular young AhedTamimi from the occupied territories in Palestine.\nLastSunday Ahed was released from prison.\n\nI mether daddy in Ramallah three months ago.

In Dublin, Constabulary hurried from street to street, noting who was speaking, who was listening. Soon they realised that it was all Dublin which was defying them, and, in the country, all Ireland. They threw up their hands - what could be done with people like that?\" \n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27458  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nArising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever\nTHE first of the many street demonstrations of the Civil Rights movement in Ireland was the August 1968 march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system. In 2017 just 391 people took part in newly establishedapprenticeship programmes, compared to the government’s target of 800.\n “Inaddition, only nine of the promised fifteen new apprenticeship programmes wereintroduced last year.”\n SinnFéin has also outlined the benefits of an all-Ireland apprenticeship system andthe benefits that would come with including trade unions in the development andgovernance of the programmes. The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people. To date, none of thismoney has been drawn down from the EU.”\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27460  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nLet\u0026#039s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0026#039s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nThis Saturday the 50th anniversary of the first organised civil rights march in the North will be marked with a commemoration march from Coalisland to Dungannon. \nThe original march, held on August 24, 1968, was the first to be organised by the Civil Rights Association in the north, which was founded the previous year to challenge the institutionalised discrimination and injustice of the Six County state. \nIt was stopped at an RUC cordon before it reached its destination at Market Square in Dungannon but the organisers went ahead with their protest and held speeches at sang the civil rights anthem, \u0027We Shall Overcome\u0027, at the police cordon. \nAn estimated 2,500 people took part in the original march fifty years ago. \nThe Coalisland to Dungannon march was followed by a march in Derry on October 5 1968 which was brutally attacked by the RUC. The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north.

It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow (Thursday) so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today (Wednesday) for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"charity sorry for keeping shop open during omagh commemoration","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They had everything they wanted.\" \n\nMr Currie was brought up in Coalisland, an overwhelmingly nationalist town. \n\nHe was elected as a Nationalist MP for East Tyrone from 1964 until 1972, and was one of the founders of the SDLP.\n\nHe moved to the Republic in 1989 and was Fine Gael TD for Dublin West.\n\nIn June 1968 Mr Currie and others occupied a house in Caledon, Co Tyrone, in protest at the discriminatory allocation of houses by the local council. \n\nWhen he saw a 19-year-old girl \"who happened to be a Protestant and a unionist\" and \"worked at a unionist politician\u0027s solicitor\u0027s office\" being allocated a home ahead of 269 others on the waiting list, he said he felt compelled to take action. \n\n\"I just felt it was unfair, unjust, intolerable and something had to be done, and I did it,\" he said. \n\nMr Currie said he made the decision to organise the march after taking part in the protests against the housing situation, hoping the event would be similar to those witnessed in the southern states of the United States. Two months after that march, another civil rights protest ended in violent scenes when police clashed with protesters in Londonderry. \n\nMr Currie said organisers had actually been disappointed with the numbers that turned out for the march, which had been banned, yet he said it has since become one of the catalysts for the entire civil rights movement here. \n\n\"The RUC acted absolutely stupidly and in front of the television cameras, particularly RTE, they ran awry, they ran mad and it was on the television and was seen around the world and that really effectively gave the boost which became the very successful civil rights movement,\" he said. \n\nThe former TD said he regretted the loss of lives during the Troubles that ensued afterwards. \n\n\"It wasn\u0027t inevitable that it would happen,\" he said, insisting non-violence was at the heart of the civil rights movement. It was very unfortunate and was not inevitable. But I wish it hadn\u0027t happened.\"\n\nMr Currie added: \"The civil rights campaign was an extremely successful organisation and it actually changed the whole political scene as far as Northern Ireland was concerned, and of course I don\u0027t regret that.\" \n\nHe criticised the current power-sharing impasse at Stormont. He said it was a \"totally hypocritical situation\" that elected representatives were being paid when the Assembly was not sitting. \n\nVeteran DUP man Nelson McCausland has a very different interpretation of the civil rights movement. \n\nThe former Stormont minister said: \"It may be the anniversary of the first civil rights march but he said it was certainly not their first appearance on the streets in that they had been out in Easter in 1968 against the banning of the republican Easter Rising parade. \n\n\"That in a sense was part of the problem, that right from the start the civil rights movement was so closely aligned with Irish nationalism and republicanism.\" \n\nHe said the movement was \"never going to be a place that was welcoming to unionists\".\n\nHe added: \"The tragedy is that it led on eventually to a situation which broke out into violence that led to more than 3,000 people dead.\" \n\nThe former MLA claimed that there are a lot of inaccuracies when it came to the housing statistics from the time.\n\n\"Much of what was put forward as fact to justify claims of discrimination was actually manipulated,\" he claimed. \n\nHe said there were some examples where there was an \"unbalance\" but he maintained that overall there was a \"fairly reasonable\" spread of council housing going to Catholic and Protestants at the time. \n\n\"It\u0027s not the picture that was portrayed at the time,\" he said.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37245612.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/fatberg1.jpg","title":"massive fatberg pours out of sewer into west belfast street","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We would remind all our customers that opening a manhole and putting anything down it is forbidden. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes. Incidents like this cause out of sewer flooding and require valuable time and resources to resolve,\" she said.\n\nShe urged people to dispose of their fat, oil and grease properly. \n\n“While most homes and businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don’t, contributed to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area,\" Mrs McCullagh said\n\n“We would appeal to all our customers, especially food outlets, to dispose of their fat, oil and grease appropriately. For householders, let it cool and then put it into the bin. Alternatively, pour it into a disposable container and take it to your local oil bank.\n\n“Businesses also risk blocking their own drainage systems, which results in extra costs being incurred in clean-up efforts. These fat blockages can not only result in out of sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises. Ways to dispose of FOG include fitting a grease trap, using an enzyme dosing system or recycling it.\"\n\nMrs McCullagh said the fatberg was having a negative affect on the whole community.\n\n“We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell it (not even us!) but the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year,\" he said.\n\n“We all have the power to stop it. In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £1.5 billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipes if people continue to flush wipes (including flushable), sanitary items and cotton buds down the toilet.”\n\nShe urged people to properly dispose of sanitary products.\n\n“According to recent research carried out by Water UK, 93% of the material causing sewer blockages was made up of wipes - including a high proportion of baby wipes - which are not designed to be flushed. Less than 1% of the domestic waste in the blockages was identified as made up of products which are designed to be flushed, such as toilet paper.\n\n“Customer awareness and behaviour change is the only real way to address sewer misuse it’s simple really, don’t flush anything other than paper, poo and pee.\n\n“Visit \nwww.niwater\n for further information.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland gcse results appendicitis didnt stop kira achieve amazing 11","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It will see Dornan reunited with The Fall creator Allan Cubbitt, with the adaptation set over the course of 24 hours in 1885 rural Fermanagh. \n\nHe isn\u0027t the only member of the Dornan clan hoping to get a good return on the property market. Last month his father, leading obstetrician Professor Jim Dornan, put his luxury Crawfordsburn property on the market for nearly £1m.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rebirth of belfast celtic put on hold by irish fa","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

which is now set to continue for at least another 12 months.\n\n\n \nRead more: \nSport and Leisure Swifts\u0027 name change could harm our own Irish League dream: Belfast Celtic Young Men reveal grand ambitions\n \n\n\n\nThe IFA board declared that because the club had already affiliated to the County Antrim FA as Sport \u0026 Leisure Swifts on June 26, and then contacted the IFA about switching to Belfast Celtic on July 5, the association would consider their request for the 2019/2020 season, rather than this one.\n\nIn a statement, the IFA quoted Article 4.2 of the its Articles of Association, which states that \"applications for any change of member\u0027s name ... must be approved by the board prior to affiliation to the Divisional Association\".\n\nIt added: \"As the club affiliated to the County Antrim FA on 26 June for the 2018/19 season, and first contacted the Association on 5 July regarding the name change, the board determined that the request will be given active consideration ahead of the affiliation deadline for the 2019/20 season.\"\n\nIt all means that the Bluefin Sport Premier Intermediate League team will remain as Sport and Leisure Swifts for the 2018/19 campaign.\n\nIf they wish to continue with their plan to change their name to Belfast Celtic, the earliest that could happen is for the start of next season - if the IFA grants their request.\n\nSport and Leisure had previously stated that they were aware of the sensitivities a name change could bring and hoped to involve everyone with an interest in the issue.\n\nThey also claimed it would bring investment into the club, adding that they felt it was the best way to bring senior football to west Belfast.\n\nManaged by former Cliftonville and Coleraine great Packie McAllister, the club have ambitious plans to move forward.\n\nUntil it was dissolved in 1949, Belfast Celtic - known as the \u0027Grand Old Team\u0027 - had been one of the most successful sides in Ireland, winning 14 Irish League titles and eight Irish Cups.\n\nSince the proposal by Sport and Leisure was announced, the Belfast Celtic Society, set up to protect and preserve the history of the original Belfast Celtic, have denied links to the project and outlined concerns regarding the move.\n\nIn yesterday\u0027s Belfast , junior club Belfast Celtic Young Men revealed their fears that the proposed name change by Sport and Leisure could damage their prospects of bringing the famous Belfast Celtic name back to the top tier of Irish League football.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pope in ireland comments on my decision to meet francis belong in past says uups butler","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But the wife of suspended DUP MP Ian Paisley offered her support. \n\nFiona Paisley said: \"My head is in my hands after reading some of the replies to your post Robbie, each to their own view. Always do what you think is right in your heart.\"\n\nMr Butler, who is a deacon in Maghaberry\u0027s Elim Church, is deputising for his party leader at the event because Robin Swann will be taking part in a Royal Black Preceptory parade in Larne.\n\nIn his video, the MLA said the papal visit was of major significance to hundreds of thousands of Catholics on both sides of the border. \n\nDefending his decision to attend the Dublin event, he said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party is a political party, not a religious party.\"\n\nHe said he was looking forward to hearing what Pope Francis said and hoped he would address the challenges faced by the church on clerical sexual abuse. \n\nWhile some on Facebook praised Mr Butler\u0027s \"gesture towards reconciliation\", others described the Catholic Church as \"evil\" and \"a cancer on all that\u0027s good\". Some posters referred to \"the Papists\" and \"thousands of Protestants martyred by the Papist Church\". \n\nOne poster commented: \"Very sorry to see as a Protestant you are looking for hope from the anti-Christ in Rome. \n\n\"I urge you in God\u0027s name to take a stand for Christ and wash your hands of the unclean filthy thing.\" Another said the UUP had lost its \"backbone as well as voters\". \n\nMr Butler said: \"I respect that some people have a different opinion to me on going to meet the Pope but I am still surprised and disappointed by some of the comments.\n\n\"Views have resurfaced which I had hoped belong to the past.\n\n\"I am confident enough in both my faith and my brand of unionism to attend the Dublin Castle event.\n\n\"I feel very strongly about the need to be respectful, open and embracing and to treat my Catholic neighbours as I\u0027d like to be treated myself.\"\n\nThe UUP MLA said unionists had to reach out to the entire community. \"As head of the Church of England, Queen Elizabeth has met five popes during her reign. She spent five hours in the Vatican with Pope Francis in 2014 so surely it is acceptable for a unionist to attend one short event in Dublin Castle?\" he said.\n\n\"Unionism is not and should not be restricted to one religion. It must reach out to all sections of the community.\n\n\"As a fireman, I worked with a mixed crew and we served diverse communities. Religion didn\u0027t come into my work then and it doesn\u0027t now.

years since Pope John Paul II established it in 1994 to strengthen the bonds between families and bear witness to the “crucial importance” of marriage and the family.\n\nThere will be many speakers and seminars at events across the capital and the highlight will be the Pope taking part in a session.\n\nAs part of it, the Festival of Families is choreographed as a celebration of family life in music song, dance, and spoken word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis will join an audience of 82,500 in the Croke Park sports stadium where he will hear testimonies from families and see performers like Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli.\n\n\nWhat else is the Pope going to be doing on Saturday?\n\n\nHe will visit Irish President Michael D Higgins at his home in the Phoenix Park then see Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Dublin Castle for a meeting lasting around 15 minutes.\n\nThe subject of his conversation with Mr Varadkar has been the subject of speculation, including whether the Irish premier will raise the clerical sex abuse scandal which has rocked the Catholic church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis will meet Leo Varadkar and Michael D Higgins (Niall Carson/PA)\n\n\n\n\nThe Pope is also expected to visit St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral.\n\nHe will undertake a private trip to a day centre for homeless families.\n\n\nWhy is he going to Knock shrine on Sunday?\n\n\nFrancis is following in the footsteps of his predecessor John Paul II, who visited the shrine in 1979, a century after an apparition was said to have occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nPeople from the village in Co Mayo in the West of Ireland said they witnessed an apparition of Mary, Joseph, St John the Evangelist, a lamb and cross on an altar at the gable wall of the local parish church.\n\nThe witnesses prayed and watched in pouring rain for two hours.\n\nAlthough they themselves were saturated not a single drop of rain fell on the gable or vision, according to the shrine’s website.\n\nThere were 15 official witnesses, most of whom were from the village of Knock and surrounding areas aged between five and 74.\n\nEach testified to an official commission of enquiry in October 1879 which deemed them trustworthy and satisfactory.\n\n\nWhere is the final event of the pontiff’s trip?\n\n\nAt Dublin’s Phoenix Park, site of a towering papal cross where John Paul II said mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nOn September 29, 1979 more than a million people formed the largest gathering of the Irish in history.\n\nThis time around, half a million are expected and those travelling have been warned to expect major congestion and urged to use public transport.\n\nProtests are expected to take place, including at Dublin’s Garden of Remembrance.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dating apps

recent heatwave is being also believed to be behind an increase in the spread of the infection syphilis, with more people being sexually active in the warm weather.\n\nAbertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board has seen five times as many people diagnosed with syphilis in the last four months compared to same period last year.\n\nSince April there have been 56 confirmed cases of the infection in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend – with 16 of those coming in the last two weeks alone.\n\nMost of the patients have been men, but several women have also tested positive.\n\nDoctors believe the reason behind the steep rise could be an increase in people using online dating apps like Tinder and Bumble to meet up for unprotected sex, then deleting their partners profiles afterwards, preventing them from warning them if they are diagnosed with an infection later on.\n\nSymptoms for syphilis can include small painless sores or ulcers, blotchy red rashes, small skin growths or white patches in the mouth.\n\nIt may also cause tiredness, headaches, joint pains and swollen glands, but some people may experience no symptoms at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK’s recent heatwave is being also believed to be behind the increase (Ben Birchall/PA)\n\n\n\n\nIf left untreated the infection can spread to the brain or other parts of the body, causing serious and long-term problems.\n\nThe health board, in South Wales, are urging people to contact sexual health clinic if they have had unprotected sex in recent months.\n\nABMU sexual health lead nurse Joanne Hearne said: “There has been an increase in syphilis generally across Wales.\n\n“But we have seen a significant rise across the health board area, particularly over the last six weeks.\n\n“It is possible that the heatwave earlier in the summer led to people becoming more sexually active.\n\n“We also believe social media and the growth of dating websites and apps is

York Public Library (NYPL) has teamed up with advertising agency Mother to create “Insta Novels”, which turns literary works into animated digital novels on Instagram Stories. \n\nThe digitised books take inspiration from the layouts of the original classics and combine with modern art created by various Instagram illustrators. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view the Insta Books, readers can rest their thumbs on the screen to hold the page and then lift them when they are ready to turn it.\n\nAnd those willing to let the book run will be able to see an animation.\n\nThe first classic to make it to Insta Novels is Alice In Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, which was illustrated by designer \nMagoz\n.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd over the next few months, the NYPL will release the digital versions of The Yellow Wallpaper, a short story by Charlotte Perkins, and The Metamorphosis, a Franz Kafka novella. \n\nThe digital novels will be collected as Highlights, so users can find and read them at a later date.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorinna Falusi, partner and chief creative officer of Mother in New York, said: “This project is directly in line with the library’s mission is to make the world’s knowledge accessible to all.\n\n“It’s appropriate that one of the works we’re using is The Metamorphosis, because in collaboration with Mother, we are completely transforming the way people look at this popular social media platform, and reimagining the way people access the classics.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new york public library is lending out smart clothes to help people find work","story":"\n Hi

I’ve held several job-hunting talks for teens, and, at one of them, one teen boy said he didn’t have any professional work clothes to wear for a job interview.\n\n“His comments got me started thinking of ways to help teens or adults like him who could not afford business attire. I thought the best and least complicated way would be to offer work accessories for library patrons to borrow.”\n\nShe added that lots of patrons would ask to borrow folders to put their CVs and paperwork in, which made her think that a briefcase or a handbag would be better.\n\nMs Lee said she realised that feedback she got at her talks for teenagers made her realise that some young people had no idea what to wear for a job interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrarian Michelle J. Lee says some young people didn’t know they needed to dress smartly for job interviews before attending seminars at NYPL (NYPL/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“Some teens were surprised to learn that they should dress up for a job interview and they should not wear jeans, hoodies, or T-shirts,” she said.\n\n“I’ve also helped many teens and adults review their resumes at the library as well, so that was another sign of the need for the programme.”\n\nSo far, many of the accessories were bought with money donated by charitable organisations, although members of the public have donated items as well.\n\nMs Lee said: “Job-hunting is tough, and it can be even harder if you do not have the fashion accessories to make a good impression at the job interview.\n\n“Our main job at the library is to help people, and I hope to help teens or adults who cannot afford a briefcase, a handbag or tie gain access to one, gain more confidence in their presentation and ace that job interview.”\n\n“The ties could also be borrowed for other occasions, too, for prom, graduation, concert performance, audition or other formal event.”\n\nAnother initiative by the library was its “Grow Up” programme last year, which involved a series of life skills workshops.\n\nThey included subjects such as appropriate workplace attire for men and women, how to apply for university, healthy eating on a budget, and money management.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"amazon alexa skirts around childrens questions about sensitive topics","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

dublin popes visit","story":"\nTHOUSANDS of local people are expected to travel from Derry to Dublin for the visit of Pope Francis this weekend.\n\nThe local clergy and members of the public will make the journey to Dublin on August 26 for the World Meeting of Familes event where Pope Francis will say Eucharistic Mass to 500,000 people at Phoenix Park. \n\nHowever, many will travel days in advance for a three-day congress with speakers, workshops and discussions, which began yesterday at the RDS.\n\nThe Pope’s 36-hour visit will begin at Croke Park for the Festival of Families on August 25 and he will travel to Knock for a short visit on Sunday before returning to Dublin for the Mass at 3pm.\n\nBishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, said he expects thousands to make the journey from Derry to Dublin with some parishes running four or five coaches each.\n\nA special train service run by Translink will also depart from Derry at 5.40am on Sunday, August 26.\n\nThe Bishop was speaking as hundreds of parishioners attended a special opening ceremony held at St Eugene’s Cathedral on Tuesday night ahead of the visit.\n\nHe commented: “There’s a real interest around the country about what’s going to happen during the course of the next five or six days in Dublin. \n\n“Obviously there’s lot of controversy involved but there is still a very large crowd hoping to be in Dublin for the congress on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and then for the two big days at the weekend on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n“I think it has engendered a degree of interest and I hope that people are nourished by it rather than disappointed.\n\n“There are a large number of buses, plus our train, full of people going down to Dublin both during the week and then particularly for Saturday and Sunday. \n\n“We had plenty of tickets here for Croke Park, and we have none left at this stage, they’re all gone. \n\n“We have a high level of interest and I think people haven’t been put off by the distance, there’s a sense of adventure going to one of those events and it certainly won’t happen for another long time to come. I’m expecting thousands to travel.”\n\nSince the last Papal visit in 1979 by Pope John Paul II, the Catholic Church in Ireland has been immersed in scandal with the uncovering of widespread clerical sexual abuse of children and cover-ups.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320, 50], [300, 250]])                .addSize([980, 200], [[300, 250]])                .build()            slot = googletag.defineSlot(\u0027/29764278/derrynow_article_mpu\u0027, [1, 1], \u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)                .defineSizeMapping(mapMpu)                                                            .setTargeting(\u0027section\u0027, \u0027news\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027page\u0027, \u0027article\u0027)                                            .setTargeting(\u0027id\u0027, \u0027244555\u0027)                                                    .addService(googletag.pubads())            googletag.display(\u0027div-gpt-mid-article\u0027)            googletag.pubads().refresh([slot])        })    \n\n\n\nOn Monday, Pope Francis condemned the ‘atrocities’ of child sex abuse and acknowledged the Church’s failings in a letter to the world\u0027s 1.2bn Roman Catholics.\n\nBishop McKeown believes Pope Francis will not shirk from the issue but will ‘hold a mirror up to the Irish Church’ and challenge it to fulfil its role in society.\n\n“I think what the Pope will do is, he will hold a mirror up for the Irish Church to look at itself, to see how well it is serving the gospel. But I think he will also hold a mirror up to Irish society and say, why are we losing so many young people? Why is there this level of dysfunctionality? Why is there so much fragility in relationships?\n\n“I hope he will ask awkward questions and speak the truth in love about how the Church needs to repent and equip itself if it is to be a credible witness of God’s mercy and love in 2018. I hope he will encourage civil society to look beyond the gloss and the jingles if it is to cherish all the children of the country equally.”\n\nHe added: “I hope and pray that Church and state learn from the mistakes of the past but not be trapped by only looking backwards. The blame game always seeks the fault in somebody else.
