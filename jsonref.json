Britain\u0027s youngest patient is 18 years old, while the oldest is 85. The majority are double-vaccinated, but officials would not reveal whether any had also had a booster jab. It came as vital stocks of lateral flow tests ran out after ministers called on Britons to take one before meeting family this Christmas. A message on the Government website says there are \u0027no more home test kits available right now\u0027 and tells Britons to \u0027try again later\u0027. A spokesman insisted there was no shortage, but said \u0027exceptionally high\u0027 demand meant they had stopped taking new orders while existing ones were completed. They said the kits could still be picked up from community sites including pharmacies, schools and colleges, and that PCR swabs are available. In another sign of chaos, Britons desperate to get their top-up doses were left standing in up to five-hour queues as centres warned they were already running low on doses this morning.

Biden’s sinking approval ratings have intensified questions over whether he will seek a second term, although the president and his team insist he intends to do so.Psaki said the president looked forward to “communicating directly” with Manchin about the Build Back Better Act, adding that the senator has been acting “in good faith” throughout the negotiations. The press secretary said the meeting represented a “continuation of that conversation,” but she would not outline what sticking points remain for Manchin before he will support the bill.“On Wednesday, December 15, the President will travel to Ft. Campbell, Kentucky for a storm briefing, and to Mayfield and Dawson Springs, Kentucky to survey storm damage following the devastating tornadoes and extreme weather,” the White House said in a new advisory. The president confirmed his travel plans after meeting with several senior advisers to discuss the federal government’s response to the storms, which killed at least 64 people in Kentucky. “We’re going to get this done. We’re going to be there as long as it takes to help,” Biden said in the Oval Office moments ago. The president also promised to provide states with “whatever they need when they need it” to help residents affected by the storms.  Biden has already approved a major disaster declaration in Kentucky, making federal funds available to help residents find temporary housing and start home repairs. Assuming the House also approves the contempt resolution, which seems highly likely, the justice department will need to determine whether to prosecute Meadows. The justice department is already prosecuting Steve Bannon for refusing to cooperate with the select committee. A federal grand jury indicted the former Trump adviser last month on two counts of contempt of Congress. The meeting comes after Meadows ended his cooperation with the committee, claiming investigators were not respecting the former president’s claims of executive privilege over certain records. However, the Democratic chair of the committee, Bennie Thompson, said in a letter to Meadows’ attorney last week that his client is also refusing to discuss his own personal records, which are not subject to executive privilege claims.  “There is no legitimate legal basis for Mr. Meadows to refuse to cooperate with the Select Committee and answer questions about the documents he produced, the personal devices and accounts he used, the events he wrote about in his newly released book, and, among other things, his other public statements,” Thompson said in his letter.  “The Select Committee is left with no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution.”Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Manchin said he is concerned about some of the bill’s programs expiring after a year or a few years while the costs of the legislation extend over 10 years. However, if Democrats attempt to alter the bill to better reflect Manchin’s concerns, that time-consuming process will likely stretch well into 2022. And Democratic leaders are still hoping they can pass the bill before the end of the year, in order to allow checks from the expanded child tax credit program to be mailed out next month.Powerful tornadoes barrelled through five US states on Friday, levelling houses and factories and bringing down power lines. In Kentucky, the worst-hit state, one tornado alone followed an extraordinarily long and destructive path of more than 200 miles. Authorities are still tallying the devastation, and the death toll has not been confirmed, but Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, estimated on Monday that at least 64 people had died there with dozens more unaccounted for. At least six people have been killed in Illinois, four in Tennessee, two in Arkansas and two in Missouri. One of the hardest hit towns was Mayfield in west Kentucky, where a candle factory was levelled, killing at least eight people.  Police and fire stations in Mayfield were destroyed, homes were flattened or lost roofs, giant trees were uprooted and street signs mangled.  “Thank you @POTUS for your rapid approval of Kentucky’s Major Disaster Declaration,” the Republican leader said on Twitter. “Our entire congressional delegation came together to support @GovAndyBeshear’s request. I appreciate the Administration’s quick work to speed resources to help deal with this crisis.” Biden approved the request last night, allowing Kentucky to access federal resources to help provide residents affected by the tornadoes with temporary housing and money for home repairs, among other services. “With this amount of damage and rubble, it may be a week or even more before we have a final count on the number of lost lives,” Beshear said. Officials believe there are currently at least 105 state residents who are unaccounted for, and search teams are working to find them. “I know, like the folks in western Kentucky, I’m not doing so well today, and I’m not sure how many of us are,” Beshear said. The governor said he was taking notes on the confirmed deaths this morning, and he realized that he was writing on the back of one of his children’s school assignments. The assignment was about inertia, the scientific principle that objects in motion will stay in motion. “So we’re going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and push through this,” Beshear said. “To the people of western Kentucky, we’re not going anywhere. We’re going to be with you today. We’re going to be with you tomorrow. And we’re going to be there with you to rebuild.” Speaking at a press conference this morning, the Democratic governor noted that 18 of the known victims are still unidentified. “Of the ones that we know, the age – the age range is five months to 86 years, and six are younger than 18,” Beshear said, his voice breaking with emotion as he updated the death toll. The governor had previously said that officials feared the death toll would exceed 100, but those estimations have decreased as more potential victims have been found alive.The president will be briefed by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, Fema administrator Deanne Criswell and Homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall in about 45 minutes. Biden has already declared a federal emergency in Kentucky, as rescue efforts continue across the state. The Democratic governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, had initially said officials feared the death toll would exceed 100, but that number is now expected to be closer to 50. “We are praying that maybe original estimates of those we have lost were wrong. If so, it’s going to be pretty wonderful,” the governor said yesterday. Read more of the ’s coverage on the tornadoes: Fauci warned that the Omicron variant appeared to be able to “evade” the protection of two initial doses of the mRNA-type Covid vaccines – PfizerBioNTech’s and Moderna’s – as well as post-infection therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma. Omicron is spurring new fears as US infections begin to surge again, with infections currently still led by the highly-transmissable Delta variant that has dominated since the summer. Fauci said an extra vaccine shot provides “optimal” protection against Omicron, even though the government’s official designation of “fully vaccinated” remained at two doses of Pfizer or Moderna, or one of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson’s vaccine, which was developed by another method. Democrats are trying to pass the legislation using a process known as reconciliation, meaning they only need 51 votes to get it approved rather than the 60 votes that are usually necessary when Republicans filibuster a bill. Over the summer, Manchin called for a “strategic pause” in the negotiations over the $1.75tn spending package until lawmakers had a clearer picture of how inflation was faring. However, since Manchin published that September op-ed, a number of economists and market analysts have said they do not believe the bill will significantly worsen inflation, which may have somewhat alleviated the West Virginia senator’s concerns. For more information on the latest inflation news, read the ’s report from Friday: Centrist Senator Joe Manchin will reportedly meet with Joe Biden in the next couple of days, as Democrats race to pass the president’s Build Back Better Act before the end of the year. If Democrats cannot pass their bill before the end of the year, it will jeopardize the extension of the expanded child tax credits, which have become a life-saving benefit for many American families over the past year. If the bill does not pass, the party will likely have a much harder time convincing voters to reelect them next year, and Biden could face the same dilemma in 2024. So the stakes could not be higher, and once again, all eyes are on Manchin to see whether he will allow Democrats to move forward.

Photograph: iStockOne-third of people who received a Covid-19 booster dose last week were given the Moderna vaccine, as the Health Service Executive (HSE) seeks to use up supplies that are close to their expiry date.Under a change of policy, most people being offered booster shots at mass vaccination centres are now being given Moderna rather than Pfizer. Last week, Moderna accounted for 35 per cent of booster shots administered, while the rest were Pfizer, according to HSE figures. Up to then, the use of Moderna was negligible compared to Pfizer.The HSE has over 1 million doses of Moderna that are due to expire at different dates in the near future, a spokesman confirmed. The use of Moderna is confined to those aged 30 years and over under-30s will be administered Pfizer.As during the original vaccine rollout, people cannot choose which vaccine they receive.The HSE had been aiming to administer 240,000 booster doses last week, which would have been the highest figure so far in the booster rollout. However, Storm Barra forced the closure of some centres, so the number of doses administered was about 220,000.About half of all boosters are now being administered in GP surgeries and pharmacies, with the rest given in mass vaccination centres.Last week for example, 80,000 boosters were provided by GP practices and 30,000 by pharmacies, while 110,000 were administered at vaccination centres.On Sunday, 20,000 people received their booster dose at a walk-in centre, up from 15,000 the previous Sunday.It is planned to further increase the throughput in vaccination centres, from a maximum of 160,000 to 200,000 a week, while maintaining numbers passing through GP surgeries and pharmacies.In contrast to the original vaccine rollout earlier in the year, supply is not a constraint with adequate stocks of mRNA vaccines available to meet demand.This time around, however, the large centre that previously operated at the Aviva Stadium is not available as it is needed for sporting events. At present, the biggest vaccination centres in the capital are Citywest and Croke Park, both of which have 50 booths.The centre at UCD, which saw long queues at times last week, has only 10 booths, but this is being increased to 15. The Croke Park centre also has 10 booths, and a new centres at Richmond Barracks in Inchicore is due to open later this week.Centres are currently offering boosters to people aged 60-69, 50-59, healthcare workers, and younger people in vulnerable groups.So far, 157,000 people are 80 years and over have received a booster, as have 285,000 people aged 70-79. Over 271,000 60-69-year-olds have had a third dose, along with 190,000 50-59-year-olds.Not everyone in these age-groups is eligible yet to receive a booster, as at least five months has to elapse since completion of their primary vaccine course, or three months if they got the Janssen vaccine.The HSE is currently working on revised plans to speed up the booster programme for adults and teenagers, and to begin administering vaccines to children aged 5-11 years.It aims to have 1.5 million booster doses administered by Christmas.

Photograph: The Facebook has removed the page of Dolores Cahill, a former UCD Professor and prominent anti-vaccination activist.The page, which had more that 130,000 followers, was removed by the social media giant as part of its “aggressive steps to fight harmful Covid-19 misinformation on our platforms,” said a spokeswoman for Meta, Facebook’s parent company.Another page, which appears to be linked to Ms Cahill and has a much smaller following, is still active.Over the course of the pandemic Ms Cahill has become one of the most prominent purveyors of Covid-19 misinformation both in Ireland and internationally.The academic has a history of making outlandish claims relating to the pandemic which are not supported by evidence, including that facemasks lower the IQ of children.She ceased her employment as a UCD professor in the field of proteomics in UCD at the start of this academic year amid increasing controversy about her public remarks on Covid-19 and vaccinations. She had applied for retirement some months previously.The university had faced repeated calls to take action against the academic but said that the principle of academic independence prevented it from doing so.Last month she was fined £2,500 by a London court for holding an anti-lockdown protest in “flagrant breach” of Covid restrictions.Research from the Institute of Strategic Dialogue (ISD) in October found that a network founded by Ms Cahill on Facebook almost doubled in reach this year, despite pledges by Facebook to tackle pandemic-related misinformation.The network, known as the World Doctors Alliance (WDA), is made up of 12 academics and doctors, including three who have been struck off or suspended.At the start of the pandemic, its members were being followed by only 3,500 people on Facebook. By July 1st, 2021, that figure had grown to 460,179. The group was founded as an offshoot of another conspiracy theory group, the World Freedom Alliance, of which Ms Cahill is President.Facebook has faced sustained criticism for not taking enough action against Covid-19 misinformation on the platform, including from Frances Haugen, a former employee turned whistleblower, who recently released thousands of pages of damning documents detailing the company’s internal workings.On Monday, a Meta spokeswoman said that since the pandemic began it “has removed over 16 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram containing harmful Covid-19 misinformation and have taken down groups and pages for repeatedly sharing this material.“This includes Dolores Cahill’s Facebook Page. We’ve also added warning labels to more than 167 million pieces of additional Covid-19 content thanks to our network of fact-checking partners.”Ms Cahill has been asked for comment.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"russia vetoes irish led un resolution on climate action","story":"The resolution sought to take action to prevent conflict posed by climate change and to make the issue a permanent fixture on the council’s agenda. Photograph: iStockRussia has vetoed a United Nations security council resolution on climate and security brought forward by Ireland and Niger, which was co-sponsored by 113 member states.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the decision of one country to use its veto to block the move “very disappointing”.The resolution sought to take action to prevent conflict posed by climate change and to make the issue a permanent fixture on the council’s agenda.Speaking to The , Mr Coveney said: “It’s a reminder of how outdated the veto system in the security council actually is. Because not only is that system outdated but I think the view that Russia holds on climate change as a driver of conflict is also outdated.“They are very much isolated, I think, in their view that these two issues shouldn’t be connected… To deny that that link and that connection is really head-in-the-sand stuff at this stage“It shows how the inappropriate use of a veto can be totally contrary to to what the mainstream opinion is internationally in terms of calls for action on a hugely important issue.”The resolution was drafted and negotiated by Ireland and Niger following the council meeting on climate and security chaired by Taoiseach Micheál Martin on September 23rd in New York during Ireland’s presidency of the council.“The impact of climate change is global and our collective security is at risk,” Mr Martin said.“The resolution sought to consolidate the climate and security agenda within the council’s programme of work. Its adoption would have been an important first step in establishing a strengthened framework for future action,” Mr Coveney explained on Monday.Co-sponsorsIreland and Niger, who jointly lead the Expert Group on Climate and Security, guided extensive consultations on the text for over the past two months, securing the support of 12 council members. In spite of strong support from more than 100 co-sponsoring countries, Russia – a permanent council member – voted against the resolution, along with one elected member, India.“Although this is disappointing, the process confirms that the majority of UN member states believe the council should factor the security risks of climate change into its decision-making,” Mr Coveney said.Ireland had committed to advancing the issue of climate and security during its time on the council, and this work represented a major step forward, he said.“It has highlighted the relevance of climate risks to international peace and security, and Ireland’s commitment to engaging constructively on such a key issue. We have consolidated support at the UN, and can galvanise work to focus on this issue in the future.”The question of the security implications of climate change would not go away, the Minister said. “Recent analysis could not be more clear – the adverse effects of climate change are only going to worsen, contributing to insecurity and exacerbating conflict. It is telling that 80 per cent of UN peacekeepers are deployed in countries that are the most exposed to climate change.”Ireland would continue to prioritise inclusion of climate “in relevant council products, and we will work to advance this agenda for the remainder of our time on the security council and beyond”, he added.The council has considered climate security since 2007 and acknowledged environmental challenges, such as droughts and degradation of agricultural land in fuelling conflict – notably in areas such as the Sahel and Horn of Africa. But it has not laid out a systemic approach in assessing risks and responding to them.A senior Pentagon official warned recently the US military was “not ready” to handle climate change, a national security issue that touched nearly every aspect of defence department planning.“We are not where we should be, and now is beyond the time when we need to get in front of that challenge,” deputy defence secretary Kathleen Hicks told CNN.Beyond rising sea levels and extreme weather, climate change has opened up new areas of strategic competition like the Arctic and intensified the competition for scarce resources, she noted, such as the raw materials required to make the lithium-ion batteries crucial to electric vehicles.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"blathering douglas ross gift nicola sturgeon","story":"More from NewsCovid vaccine passports: Everything you need to knowRetired BBC director caught with more than 800 child abuse images says they appeared ‘by accident’Handwriting in exams is too ‘tiring’ for students, headmaster warnsOsteoporosis: Over-50s who break a bone are missing out on vital tests, leading charity warnsBooster jabs to become mandatory for Covid passes, says Sajid JavidTry again tomorrow, NHS tells people battling to book vaccine booster as website is overwhelmedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"closing schools would unforgivable","story":"More from NewsHandwriting in exams is too ‘tiring’ for students, headmaster warnsOsteoporosis: Over-50s who break a bone are missing out on vital tests, leading charity warnsBooster jabs to become mandatory for Covid passes, says Sajid JavidTry again tomorrow, NHS tells people battling to book vaccine booster as website is overwhelmedDurham students plan mass college transfer requests in campaign for principal’s oustingToxic volcano gases force thousands into lockdown in SpainMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gchqs christmas card can outsmart 11 year old","story":"Never mind Secret Santa or where the TV remote control has been hidden, the real mysteries this Christmas have been set  by GCHQ.The Cheltenham-based cyber spy agency has appealed to Britain’s young people to “discover their inner intelligence officer” by decoding a set of fiendish puzzles contained in their Christmas card.  The quiz, aimed at youngsters with an interest in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM), has seven puzzles, increasing in difficulty.Rather worryingly, GCHQ has encouraged Britain’s adults to “test their skills as well and see if they are as clever as an 11-year-old”.  The agency hopes secondary schools and colleges up and down the country will take part in their Christmas challenge.They hope more young people will take an interest in STEM subjects and consider future careers in the intelligence services.Director GCHQ, Sir Jeremy Fleming, said: “From Enigma to artificial intelligence, GCHQ\u0027s history is full of talented people tackling the country’s most complex challenges. If we’re to help keep the country safe, problem-solving skills and teamwork are absolutely crucial.    “That’s why this year’s Christmas puzzles are aimed at young people.    “I want to show young people that thinking differently is a gift. It is only with the right mix of minds that they can solve seemingly impossible problems, just like we do at GCHQ.” The GCHQ Christmas card is traditionally sent to other spy agencies and partners across the world.This year the card sets a not-so-secret mission for young people through a set of puzzles which increase in difficulty, each aimed at a particular age group.To support greater take up of STEM subjects, particularly among young girls, GCHQ has partnered with the organisation Stemettes on several activities over recent years.  Supporting this year’s Christmas card challenge, CEO of Stemettes Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon, said: “No matter your age, STEM skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving are important skills to have.In my work across the Stemettes with partners like GCHQ, we want all kinds of people to have the chance to explore these skills, and for those that enjoy this type of challenge to get an opportunity to further themselves in these areas.  “GCHQ’s Christmas Challenge is a fun festive way to do this, and I’d encourage schools and those who work with children to explore this type of activity as another way to engage the next generation in some light-hearted STEM fun.”Solve the puzzles, which increase in difficulty.

follows: This time around, the restrictions are nowhere near as restrictive.Here, we take a look at the history of how and when restrictions were put in place, and if it could mean we are heading for another lockdown. On Monday, 23 Mar 2020, more than 27million people watched the Prime Minister address the nation to announce extraordinary measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It became the ninth most watched TV moment in the UK\u0027s history. Boris Johnson asked the public to stay at home and said that the police would have powers to issue fines to those who left home without a reasonable excuse.The address effectively put England into its first lockdown, and three days later the regulations were made legislation, which significantly restricted people’s free movement by prohibiting leaving home without a reasonable excuse and banning public gatherings. People were allowed to leave the house to exercise once a day, but only with members of their own households. Schools were closed to all children apart from those of key workers.All but essential high street businesses were closed and some shops were permitted to operate deliveries. Police were provided with powers to fine people, and the first review of the restrictions on Apr 16 saw the lockdown extended. At this stage, there were 6,650 confirmed Covid cases in the UK, and there had been 335 Covid deaths. By May 7, the regulations had been reviewed again, and three days later Mr Johnson began to plot Britain\u0027s route out of lockdown. By the time the Prime Minister announced the beginning of the end of the first lockdown, deaths had topped 30,000, and there were more than 200,000 Covid cases in the UK.Addressing the nation again on May 10, he set out England’s roadmap for the next phase of the lockdown.The work from home order was lifted as long as offices were Covid-secure, people were allowed to exercise an unlimited amount in a day and the previous ban on people sitting on a bench outside was lifted, as the Prime Minister encouraged people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise, saying it was fine from May 13 to sit in the sun in your local park, drive to other destinations and to play sports with members of your own household. The third formal review came on May 28, and this gave birth to the rule of six. On June 1, for the first time since Mar 23, people were allowed to meet people not in their households in groups of six providing they were outside or in gardens. The change of rhetoric removed the prohibition on being outside without a reasonable excuse and replaced it with a requirement to have a reasonable excuse to stay overnight somewhere other than your home.By the end of May, there were some 4,000 daily Covid cases being reported, and 1,452 daily Covid deaths. But the vaccine rollout was underway, with almost 25million people double-jabbed in the UK.In a statement made on the 10 June, the Prime Minister confirmed that from June 15 all retail businesses would be permitted to reopen and that people who live alone or in single parent households would be able to form a ‘support bubble’ with one other household. These changes, along with the managed return of some sporting events and the introduction of the requirement to wear face coverings on public transport from June 15, effectively bought England into the second stage of the Government\u0027s recovery strategy. Major changes to England’s lockdown were announced on June 23. This was the last time major changes were announced connected with a formal review point of the lockdown laws. The Prime Minister announced in a statement to the House of Commons that from the July 4: The Prime Minister said: Our principle is to trust the British public to use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks, remembering that the more we open up, the more vigilant we will need to be. From now on, we will ask people to follow guidance on social contact, instead of legislation.Following the announcement, the Government published guidance on what people “can and can’t do after 4 July”. This implied that, barring amended restrictions to gatherings most restrictions would be revoked from July 4.It paved the way for a relatively restriction-free summer, as people made use of the Eat Out To Help Out scheme, which saw the Government picking up 50 percent of the bill when people ate at pubs and restaurant during August. But we were only just beginning, and in July we got a glimpse of what was to come when Leicester became the first city to be hit with a local lockdown.Leicester was the first city to be placed into local lockdown on July 1.More areas were placed in local lockdown during the summer and autumn and by October there was a complicated patchwork of local restrictions across England.On Sep 9, the rule of six was reintroduced as the Prime Minister announced the tightening of coronavirus restrictions for England. He said that over time, the rules have become quite complicated and confusing and that therefore the Government was simplifying and strengthening the rules – making them easier for you to understand and for the police to enforce.He announced that from Monday Sep 14, people would be prohibited from meeting socially in groups of more than six in any setting.But as cases soared from 3,577 on Sep 10 to 7,045 on Sep 23, Mr Johnson announced that the following day on Sep 24, all pubs, bars and restaurants must operate a table service only, except for takeaways and imposed a 10pm curfew. To simplify the local restrictions, a tiered system was announced on Oct 12, which would come into force two days later. He told the Commons: In recent months we have worked with local leaders to counter local spikes with targeted restrictions. This local approach has inevitably produced different sets of rules in different parts of the country, which are now complex to understand and to enforce. So just as we simplified our national rules with the rule of six, we will now simplify and standardise our local rules by introducing a three-tiered system of local Covid alert levels in England, set at medium, high and very high. On 31 October, the Prime Minister addressed a Number 10 press conference to announce that a new national lockdown would be imposed from Nov 5. Setting out the details on Nov 2, he said the rules during the second national lockdown resembled those imposed during the first. Some changes were made at the end of November in a last-ditch attempt to save Christmas. The Governments in the four nations of the UK set out plans to allow families and friends to meet more at Christmas than was previously allowed under the coronavirus restrictions. They stated that during the 23-27 December period, up to three households could form an exclusive Christmas bubble.Equivalent legislation was introduced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, alongside the legal provision for people to meet up over the Christmas period had been a message from scientists and the Government that people should exercise caution. But On Dec 19, 2020, the Prime Minister, and the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Medical officer, announced in a Downing Street press conference that urgent changes needed to be made to coronavirus restrictions. This was in response to rapidly increasing cases of Covid-19, especially in London, the South East and East of England, and concerns about a new mutation - known then as the Kent variant.On Nov 25, when the easing was announced, daily cases were at 16,608. By Dec 20, that figure was 32,441A stricter tier of coronavirus restrictions, tier four, was announced on Dec 19 to apply across London and large parts of the South East of England and came into force at 7am on Dec 20. The tier four rules were broadly similar to those in place during the national lockdown in November. In tier 4 areas, people were required to stay at home unless they have a reasonable excuse to leave. All non-essential retail and hospitality businesses were close and people could only meet with one other person in certain public outdoor places. Christmas was cancelled for millions.In tier four areas, the rules were not be relaxed at all over the Christmas period. No indoor gatherings were allowed over the Christmas period  - with certain exceptions to this, including support bubbles. In tiers one to three, Christmas bubbles were allowed, but only for one day on Christmas Day.Mr Johnson said: As Prime Minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country. Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned.By the beginning of January, the death toll from Covid had topped 75,000 people and there were more than 50,000 daily cases being reported, almost a 50 percent increase week-on-week. The Prime Minister addressed the nation to announce a third national lockdown for England.He said that hospitals are under more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic and it was clear that we need to do more, together, to bring the new variant of the virus under control while our vaccines are rolled out.51 The third national lockdown came into force on Jan 6 as the Covid alert level was raised to its most severe - five. People were required to stay home and were only permitted to leave with a reasonable excuse. Meeting one person outside for recreation was not permitted under these national rules. However, two people not in a support bubble were allowed to meet to exercise.There were limited exempted larger gatherings from this rule, but religious services and some small weddings were exempt.The third national lockdown also involved the closing of schools, something that was not a feature of the second lockdown. The UK shifted from level five down to level four in February 2021. Mr Johnson set out a four-step plan for easing lockdown restrictions in England, as part of the Government’s roadmap out of lockdown. At the end of these steps, the UK would be back to Covid alert level three.Although the alert levels are largely for guidance, we are now just one level away from the most severe, which has always resulted in a full national lockdown. The caveat this time around is the mass rollout of the vaccination programmes. The alert levels are:The indicators for moving from level three to level four, as happened on Sunday, include the case rate being more than 250 per 100,000 population. On Dec 6, it was 502. Another indication is whether the doubling time for new infections is less than seven days, which it is with the introduction of Omicron.In order for the chief medical officers to reverse the escalation and for us to return to level three, the case rate would need to be less than 125 per 100,000, the R-rate would need to drop under one, the number of daily cases would need to be fewer than 30,000 and there would need to be a four-week downward or stable trend.Conversely, if the UK Health Security Agency, in consultation with NHS senior leadership and chief medical officers, estimated that the NHS cannot cope with demand for the next 21 days, the UK could be plunged once again into level five. More from NewsCovid vaccine passports: Everything you need to knowRetired BBC director caught with more than 800 child abuse images says they appeared ‘by accident’Handwriting in exams is too ‘tiring’ for students, headmaster warnsOsteoporosis: Over-50s who break a bone are missing out on vital tests, leading charity warnsBooster jabs to become mandatory for Covid passes, says Sajid JavidTry again tomorrow, NHS tells people battling to book vaccine booster as website is overwhelmedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one six people dementia spent last christmas alone research","story":"One in six people with dementia spent last Christmas alone, research shows, with thousands more only getting 15 minutes of human contact in the surrounding week.The polling by the Alzheimer’s Society reveals a sharp deterioration among dementia sufferers during the pandemic, with isolation and disruption to normal routines fuelling increased levels of confusion.Families said attempts to protect their most vulnerable relatives, in the face of constant changes in restrictions, have left them feeling guilty and anxious.Decisions last December to “cancel Christmas” for millions of families - with a ban on household mixing for those in the highest tiers, and freedoms relaxed for just one day in the rest of the country - meant many of the most vulnerable saw no one.Families said they were left struggling with feelings of guilt and anger about the “lost Christmas” for the most vulnerable.The survey of more than 1,000 families found 16 per cent of dementia sufferers spent Christmas Day alone. Among those who had visits from family and friends, around one-quarter were limited to doorsteps, or held through windows.Four in 10 dementia sufferers who saw no one on Christmas Day had a phone call of less than 15 minutes as their only human contact. Of those who did see someone during the week of Christmas, nearly one-third only had a 15 minute visit from either a neighbour, a family member or a paid carer.For almost half of sufferers, the only visit they got during the week was to drop off a Christmas meal or present.The research found that after more than 18 months of restrictions, 60 per cent of people with dementia were now less likely to recognise family members.Two-thirds of family carers said they were now feeling anxious about this Christmas, with a quarter now having to cope with increased caring responsibilities due to an increase in their loved ones’ dementia symptoms.Kate Lee, the chief executive officer of the Alzheimer’s Society said: “For many this festive season, the magic of Christmas will be marred by families having to cope with an unmanageable and irreversible decline in their loved ones. As the nation looks to go bigger and better this year to compensate for a Christmas in lockdown, people with dementia need us like never before.“With your generous donations, we can make sure no-one must face Christmas alone and without adequate support.”Marlene Aveyard, 70, from Guiseley, who is living with dementia, said: “Last Christmas was the first year I didn’t see my daughter, Jenine, on Christmas Day – and she is 45. Christmas Day itself was horrible. I had no special food and I didn’t open any presents, I didn’t feel in the Christmas spirit at all. I’ve never felt so lonely or isolated, I just sat and cried.“I normally pull myself up when I’m feeling down, but I couldn’t. I’m still getting over what we went through and it was several months before I saw my daughter face-to-face again.”She said the help she got from the Alzheimer’s Society was a “lifesaver,” keeping her “on an even keel” when she felt at her worst.The charity saw a significant spike in demand for its services during the “lockdown Christmas”, with calls to its helpline more than doubling that week, from 2,097 in 2019 to 5,153 in 2020 .The charity’s website saw an 88 per cent upsurge in searches on its website, with over 1,500 visits on Christmas Day. One of the most discussed topics on its online community was around how to respond to loved ones in care homes asking if they’re coming home for Christmas, the charity said.The latest figures estimate that there are now around 900,000 people living with dementia in the UK, despite so many people with the condition having died over the last 18 months, accounting for over one in four deaths from coronavirus.On Sunday, December 12, The \u0027s editors and writers manned the phone lines for this year\u0027s Christmas Charity Appeal.

He reportedly shouted: “At South College, we value freedom of speech” as several students left the dining hall and is “stepping back” from some duties while the university investigates.Niall Hignett, a first-year law student at South College who was involved in organising a demonstration against Prof Luckhurst last week, said: “We’re not giving up. Students no longer want to be here, so either Tim leaves or we do.”He said protests next term could involve “mass requests to transfer colleges, rent strikes, boycotting” as well as further demonstrations.“Once the university’s report is concluded, we\u0027ll have more concrete next steps,” he added. “This isn’t just about Tim resigning – the university needs a policy update to make sure this can’t happen again – but if he goes it will certainly subdue the anger.“Students aren’t giving up this fight because they are yet to feel safe again in South College. We won\u0027t rest until we feel safe in our homes. That involves Tim no longer being our principal and the university reviewing their policies to ensure these foul iniduals are not platformed by the university.”During his speech, Mr Liddle said he was disappointed not to see any sex workers that night – a reference to recent controversy over safety training provided by Durham University to student sex workers.He went on to say that the “science or pure facts” are that “a person with an X and a Y chromosome, that has a long, dangling penis, is scientifically a man, and that is pretty much, scientifically, the end of the story”.Following the event, Prof Luckhurst apologised for describing the students’ walkout as “pathetic”. But his apology was not enough to quell their anger, and hundreds gathered at South College last week to protest, wielding placards which included the slogans “Proud to be Pathetic” and “Luckhurst Out”.The university’s student union has urged him to resign, calling his position “untenable”.A Durham University spokesman said the university “upholds freedom of expression within the law”, adding: “We have a strong and clear policy statement and code of practice on freedom of expression and we practise this across all areas of university life.” The spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment further while their investigation continues.More from NewsCovid vaccine passports: Everything you need to knowRetired BBC director caught with more than 800 child abuse images says they appeared ‘by accident’Handwriting in exams is too ‘tiring’ for students, headmaster warnsOsteoporosis: Over-50s who break a bone are missing out on vital tests, leading charity warnsBooster jabs to become mandatory for Covid passes, says Sajid JavidTry again tomorrow, NHS tells people battling to book vaccine booster as website is overwhelmedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sick no shows postcard booster frontline","story":"I spent Sunday afternoon in a draughty tent in North London, inputting names into a clunky old computer. By 5pm, my throat was sore from repeating the same sentences scores of times. “Do you have a fever? Have you ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine? Have you had Covid in the past month?” At the end of the day, I had ‘writer’s bump’ on my middle-right finger (not seen since my A level exams) from filling in all those forms.When I got home last night I switched on the TV. There was Boris at 8pm, with a statement. We need to battle the “tidal wave” of omicron cases, he said, to avoid the risk of a New Year lockdown.“Half a million jabs were delivered yesterday,” boomed the PM, before announcing the emergency Covid booster campaign to allow 18 million eligible adults to book their jab by the end of the month – four weeks earlier than planned. “Get boosted now,” was the rallying cry.Well, Boris, I’ve been part of your booster army since January – a job that can veer between cheerleader, counsellor and gatekeeper, all within the space of five minutes. Yesterday I was part of a team responsible for dispensing 220 vaccinations.The news today is dominated by people who can’t book their jabs, of crashing NHS websites, of four-hour-long queues and unavailable lateral flow tests. The enthusiasm is encouraging – if infuriating to those unable to book. Yet despite all this, there remains an (often vocal) minority, who aren’t turning up for their boosters – if they have had the first two vaccines in the first place. Of the 250 people expected at my clinic yesterday there were about 30 ‘no shows’: those with appointments who simply did not appear.No shows at the clinic are irritating on a number of levels. For starters, because of the way the vaccine is stored: we are using Pfizer in this clinic, and doses have to be calculated exactly. Uncertainty over the final number of patients means the clinical lead is unsure how many vials she needs to open. (A vial holds six doses). Desperate to get our ‘jabs into arms’, we were forced to hawk our precious wares: I was on Twitter at 4pm, asking ‘walk-ins’ to come forward – at first under-40s, then people in their late 30s. It seems ironic that we have to beg people to turn up for something that might save their lives.The odd no show could be down to keen people finding walk-in clinics earlier in the week. But most likely it’s because our patients simply couldn’t be bothered, and found better things to do. Of the 12 or 13 clinics I have covered this year, there have always been no shows. During the Euros, we had significantly quieter clinics – funny that. On the day of the final, the clinic was cancelled altogether.But no shows beg a bigger question than pharmaceutical expediency. In the end, it comes down to why? Why aren’t they turning up? What excuse do people have at all to be ‘hesitant’, or even ‘anti’ about something that will not only save their Christmases, but their holidays abroad, their jobs, the lives of their relatives – or potentially, their own?As soon as Boris announced the miracle vaccine rollout in early January, I stepped forward. I’m not historically a volunteery kind of person. But I loved this work immediately – not only because my virtue signal was flying the vaccine clinic became my social life during the lockdowns, a completely different experience from my stay-home job as a writer. And more importantly, it made me feel like something bigger than myself – part of the ‘war effort’.My first post was at the end of January. There was snow on the ground, and it was freezing. Icy wind screeched through the fully ventilated clinic, as we helped 70 and 80-somethings take off layers of clothing to receive their vaccines. People were grateful back then – often tearfully so – knowing that the treatment they were receiving would probably save their lives. We may have received the odd box of Quality Street, and a few thank you cards.We volunteers arrived with our own arms out and our sleeves rolled up – we could not wait to get our first doses. So keen were some that the clinic had to weed out those who seemed to be volunteering only for premature immunity. The managers soon identified those who had true commitment beyond selfish purposes.As the year warmed up, the cohort got younger. Their medical forms got more straightforward, but their attitudes more varied and sometimes difficult. Most were happy to be there. Some spoke no English, and we had to mime the questions (hand across brow to signify fever, etc).Other patients were fearful and suspicious, demanding the Pfizer jab and “not the blood-clot one” (AstraZeneca). There was no choice of vaccine at the clinic there never has been. Even when we explained that the chance of a blood clot with AstraZeneca was minuscule – that you were far more likely to get this serious illness with Covid itself – the odd person spat out their annoyance and left.Then there were the people who tried to queue-jump for themselves or their relatives – a more understandable position for sure. But our polite “not yets” had to become firm at times, to say the least. Such interactions were tricky, but at least these people showed up. To everyone else out there: I repeat, why? The mRNA technique used by Pfizer and Moderna is not gene therapy it’s a one-time set of instructions to our cells that the body then ‘forgets’. The cry that “Ninety per cent of infections are among the vaccinated,” shows a basic lack of understanding of statistics: yes, there are more infections simply because so many people are mercifully vaccinated – but the vast majority do not end up in hospital. “It’s just flu”. Well, try telling that to my hitherto sanguine hospital consultant brother who saw a previously perfectly healthy member of his team die in an agony that haunted him for weeks.I could go on – as I’m no doubt will the anti-vaxxers, with their responses. “It’s my decision,” they might insist. “It doesn’t affect others.” Oh, but it does, I’m afraid. In fact, the way things are, the people who aren’t getting vaccinated might send us back into a lockdown, and open the door to new variants, on and on, ad infinitum, as well as clogging up ICUs and perhaps infecting old or ill relatives.This vaccine volunteer has a message for those who say “no”. Do you not realise that we are on the brink of yet another national emergency? That despite plan B (and the whispered about C) we could be heading for overwhelmed ICU beds and a cancelled Christmas? Is there really any excuse to be ‘anti’ or even ‘hesitant’ any more?More from NewsCovid vaccine passports: Everything you need to knowRetired BBC director caught with more than 800 child abuse images says they appeared ‘by accident’Handwriting in exams is too ‘tiring’ for students, headmaster warnsOsteoporosis: Over-50s who break a bone are missing out on vital tests, leading charity warnsBooster jabs to become mandatory for Covid passes, says Sajid JavidTry again tomorrow, NHS tells people battling to book vaccine booster as website is overwhelmedMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"working home forms new societal division readers return working","story":"From today, people across the country have once again been told to work from home if they can, as part of the Government’s new coronavirus Plan B which was announced by Boris Johnson last week at a Downing Street press conference, amid rising concern over the spread of the new omicron variant.  For swathes of workers, ditching a frosty commute for comfortable at-home working will feel like Christmas came early, but not everyone has the same experience. The latter is evidenced by the tales of the chaos at the Foreign Office over the summer, described by Boris Starling in his article, which demonstrated the dangers caused by remote working. Our readers took to the comments to argue their case for and against the return to remote working. One reader, who works in the private sector, argues that her team works harder and are more productive at home, whilst another suggests it only suits those more established in their careers and hinders new starters.What is your experience of working from home compared to being in the office? Read on to see what your fellow readers have to say and join the conversation in the comments section below. I’ve been working on a hybrid model of working from home and in-office hours for over a decade, and I can tell you that one outcome of the working from home routine is that I and my team work much longer hours when based at home. It’s not unusual to find us logged on from seven in the morning, and finishing at seven in the evening.Companies and teams that either haven’t got or don’t know how to use the technology correctly, and are managed by leaders who apply the same management and supervisory practices as if their whole team was office-based, does not work. The model for successfully operating remote teams is quite different.Those able to work from home are often the middle class, and those that can\u0027t are often the working class, which forms a new societal ision. A ision that enables some to shelter from Covid, while depriving others of that same shelter.The civil service doesn’t even have the decency to come out of hiding even when the risk has abated. I find it odd that the unions defend this inequity. Maybe this new inequality should be recognised with some being paid more and others less?We run a small company with 22 staff, 18 of whom are software builders, system builders, IT maintenance and training engineers. Last year we had 14 plus office staff, now we have four more, and we are expanding as IT and software are in such high demand. We moved to working from home and never switched back.Now, there is no stress, we carry on as before while competitors have to organise their staff again to see how many can and want to work from home. It is what our staff want. Most of the engineers are on the road most of the time anyway.Of course, the less intelligent and low paid without qualifications call them ‘shirkers’ because if they could work from home, that is what they would be doing.I run a small business, and I spend half of my day interfacing with the working from home mob and getting nothing done. Tasks which should take five minutes now take five days, and things that should take five days now take five weeks or far more. We can\u0027t plan anything. I was not in the least bit surprised by last month\u0027s GDP. Working from home doesn\u0027t work for the customer, B2B or otherwise.I have 25 years experience in the workplace, including 15 years of office-based work in Tier 1 Investment Banks and Big 4, and 10 years working hybrid and remote for start-ups. Without a doubt, the most effective work environments were remote and hybrid.Why? Because when you\u0027re not being bullied, harassed or stressed, you work longer hours. It also encourages better communication, you avoid expenses, and it helps the environment as there is less commuting.Meanwhile, remote working reduces person to person viral transmission, whilst also improving work-life balance as you are less burnt out. Therefore, I\u0027m amazed to see working from home described as bad and associated with work-shy personality types. My team works a minimum of 60 hours a week and are forced to take holidays.I particularly agree with the comments about the risks of moving services to other countries if staff are absent from the office.I manage a large team, and we had a conversation on Thursday about working from home and for those who can’t for safety or technical issues, they should continue to come in. I think everyone would prefer not to have to work from home again, but we have to follow the request. I hope this will be reviewed in the new year.The point which I think is missing is that working from home is a privilege and based on trust. Where staff underperform, then managers need to manage that or they are not doing their jobs.Maybe the Foreign office or HMRC is in chaos whilst they’re working from home - they’re civil servants.In the real world of private industry, working from home means we work longer and harder - there’s no commute and very few breaks. My colleagues and I have not stopped in the last two years. Company profits have never looked stronger.Working from home fans are clearly well established in their careers. How can it possibly be beneficial to new starters? I work in the food industry and have never had the pleasure of working remotely. Did anyone care about the ‘health emergency’ my colleagues and I faced on a daily basis?So long as you were all lazing about at home, did you ever lend a thought to the two tier society you were colluding with?

The Labour leader will make a rare statement via a pre-recorded message on BBC One reacting to the Prime Minister and speaking directly to the British people. It comes after Mr Johnson made a rare “ministerial broadcast” instead of a press conference to ramp up England’s booster vaccines.The PM announced a target for all eligible adults to be able to get a booster jab by December  - forcing the NHS to give around a million doses a day. But the format of his announcement meant the press were not able to ask questions, including on the Mirroraposs revelations that he hosted a No quiz during lockdown. The BBC can be required to give airtime for ministerial broadcasts “in exceptional circumstances, such as a decision to go to war,” according to the Corporation’s guidelines. The rules add: “In such circumstances, it may also be necessary for the BBC to consider whether responses from other political parties are appropriate.  Sir Keir has previously spoken to the nation in reaction to a broadcast by Boris Johnson. Labour’s leader yesterday said it “looks as though” the Prime Minister broke lockdown law by hosting a virtual No Christmas quiz with two colleagues by his side on  December . But Sir Keir said he would support a Tuesday vote on Plan B measures - crushing a Tory rebellion. More than  Conservatives could refuse to back making Covid passports compulsory from Wednesday at nightclubs and other large venues in England. But Labour’s leader said he would back the measures. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “I’m not supporting the government on Tuesday, I’m supporting the NHS and the public.  “Andyou look at the science in relation to Omicron, the new iant, there is a real concern that we could be in a situation where the number of cases is doubling in as short a period as two days. “Now, I understand people say, well that hasn’t led to higher hospitalisations and deaths yet, but the sheer volume of cases is very, very worrying, and that’s uppermost in my mind. “So I’m not supporting the prime minister on Tuesday, I’m supporting our NHS and I’m supporting the public in relation to this pandemic.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyConservative PartyBoris JohnsonPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They partied at the Carlton Club on the night the pubs were closed. They partied in Downing Street while drawing up rules for a third lockdown. They partied at the Treasury, the Department for Education, the Department for Work and Pensions, Conservative HQ, and the Cabinet Office.Even on a Zoom quiz, designed to help them be socially-distanced, the muppets still found a way to party, drink, gather, and in general make the Zoom call a complete waste of time and tinsel.And upstairs in the Downing Street flat, the lady of the house reclined on a golden sofa upholstered with angel wings, sipping champagne at the downfall of her nemesis.  There was a rap at the door, and it opened to reveal a Downing Street policeman dressed, for the festive season, as Fozzie Bear. Whataposs goinapos on aposere, then  he asked.The partying stopped upon the instant. Downing Street staffers, politicians, civil servants, press officers, policy wonks and wives, who all knew full well that partying was not allowed, stopped mid-swig, glancing uncertainly at the mistletoe, the Tesco wine stash, and the many households with which they were not supposed to be socialising. They waited with baited breath for the punishment PC Fozzie would dish out. He gazed around at the tinsel, the Santa hats, the unwrapped presents. You call this a party  he said. This isnapost a party. The beer is warm, the consciences are cold, and I didnapost see anything, wocka wocka! And the Detective of Christmas Past turned, and walked back through the wall of sound created by some heavy beats from the Prime Ministeraposs flat upstairs. The parties continued until past midnight, and then the Journalist of Christmas Present appeared, clutching a copy of the Daily Mirror, and accompanied by Ant and Dec. Parties raged while people died! intoned the journalist. What did you see on the Zoom call, Prime Minister We were following the rules! said the rule-breakers. We do not recognise these accounts! said people who drank so much theyaposd blacked out and woken up in a tree. Iaposm very sorry anybody noticed it, mumbled the Prime Minister, about a fortnight later. And the sensible Cratchit family turned away from the government. Bob Cratchit worked from home, although he had not even the money to pay for another lump of coal. Mrs Cratchit tried not to worry about her children getting infected at school, because homeschooling was impossible. And poor Tiny Tim, who had underlying health conditions, said: God bless the vaccination, everyone! I wish I could have it, but Iaposm not allowed for reasons no-one can understand.Unlike the police, the Journalist of Christmas Present did not go away. They stayed in the corner, looking for evidence the police were not remotely interested in looking for themselves. As the Prime Minister walked from his study up to his flat, past packed offices filled with giggling drunks, through leaving doaposs, Secret Santas, end-of-year prizegiving and other festive japery, he muttered to himself: I have been assured that all the rules were followed.Upon entering his flat, he saw his we, and his two children, and about a dozen other people. Who are they  he asked his we. Theyaposre my support bubble, said his we. What, all of them  asked the PM. She replied: Itaposs not easy, being Queen.The Prime Minister lay down in his bed, and tried not to hear the drumaposnaposbass. Keir Starmer then appeared before him, the Lawyer of Christmas Future. Prime Minister, he said. I come from  weeksapos hence, to show you the consequences of your actions.And he showed the Prime Minister a Tory backbench rebellion he showed him letters of no confidence he showed him the politan Police finally unable to deny any longer the mounting evidence of the nationaposs eyes. He showed him the North Shropshire by-election and a double-digit swing to the Lib Dems.Read more The PM saw his party, which voted to force people to show identity papers before voting, rebelling against efforts to make them have a negative Covid test or vaccine to go to the pub. He saw the Tories become electoral kryptonite for a decade.He saw % of the public disobey his instructions. He saw millions refuse to get the vaccine purely because he was the one who had told them they should. He saw his own claims proven wrong, his lies delineated and amplied, and his legacy disappear in public scorn.And then he saw the Cratchit house. He saw a family weeping for a loved one, and Tiny Timaposs crutch propped up against the wall. But how is this possible  he demanded of Starmer. How could little Tim die, when we have a world-beating vaccine rollout, and itaposs so harmless to the young   Starmer pointed an accusing finger at the PM. Because it is not world-beating. Because you have not vaccinated children when other nations have. Because even a well-vaccinated population includes people who are immuno-compromised. And because you let the NHS run hot all summer with high rates of infection with the Delta iant, in the hope of a herd immunity which has exhausted the NHS, and gave us immunity against a iant that is no longer our top concern. Tiny Tim died of blood clots and a stroke, which are much more likelyyou get covid thanyou get the vaccine. His mother nursed him, and she now has Long Covid, and is unable to work. His father cannot earn enough alone to run his home, or feed his children, and is in despair as well as grief. There are millions of homes like these, filled with weeping and fury as people curse your name, not just at the parties they know you had last Christmas, but the lies you have told since. The Prime Minister fell to his knees. I am sorry I was found out, he wailed. Iaposm sorryyou think I need to apologise. What can I do, to reverse my slump in the polls  And from the street outside, many voices rose as one to say: Tell the truth. Report it to the police. Say it was wrong. Correct the moral harm you have done, and we may yet forgive the personal price we all paid. The Prime Minister thought about this. Bah, humbug! he shouted, and slammed the door on his only possible salvation.

Addressing the nation last night, the Prime Minister said the country was facing an emergency in our battle with the new iant - and two jabs will not be enough to protect people. He warned that Omicron could rip through an un-boosted population, overwhelming the NHS and leading to very many deaths. Covid restrictions are also being ramped up after scientists discovered the new Omicron iant is much more transmissible and spreading rapidly across the UK.It comes after Boris Johnson announced last week that England would move to the Governmentaposs Plan B measures. Epidemiologists fear the iant could cause , deaths by April and that the NHS could be overwhelmed as Omicron looks set to overtake Delta as the dominant iant within days. UK Health Security Agencyadviser Dr Susan Hopkins warned of a looming wave of infections - and said more measures may be needed. She said: Itaposs inevitable that weaposre going to see a big wave of infections. What we are not yet clear on, and which is what we are basically making sure people go out and get their vaccination for, is how much that will affect hospitals.  So, what do the latest Covid curbs mean for you  Hereaposs the latest. Working from home People in England are being urged to work from home where possible from today. This is aimed at reducing contacts. The furlough scheme has not ed, however, as no businesses are being shut down at this stage. The advice is to work from home aposwhere you canapos. Face masks New rules brought into force last Friday mean that anyone aged  or over must wear a face mask to enter a wide range of indoor venues. These include places such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys. The full list:community centres , youth centres, members clubs and social clubs libraries and public reading rooms shops public transport polling stations and premises used for the counting of votes places of worship crematoria and burial ground chapels visitor attractions and entertainment venuespublic areas in hotels and hostels indoor areas of sports stadiumsPubs, bars and nightclubs are exempt. There is also an exemption for singing, which applies to, for example, congregations and choirs. Technically, a person could avoid wearing a face mask by singing, but the Government has warned protestors attempting to abuse this rule will be stoped. Daily testing for Covid contacts  From tomorrow, double-jabbed people who come into contact with an infected person will be told to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days instead of isolating. The new advice applies to all cases of Covid, regardless of whether it is the Omicron iant or other strains. Unvaccinated adults must continue to self-isolate for  daysthey are a contact of someone with Covid.This means strict rules forcing people identied as close contacts of Omicron cases to isolate for  days are being scrapped. Care homes From Wednesday, there will be a new restriction on care home visits. Care home residents will be asked to pick three people to visit and one essential care worker. Covid passports From Wednesday, England could be facing the introduction of mandatory covid passes proving your vaccination status to enter some venues, including nightclubs.So a punter could have proof of double jabbed status or, under the new pass rules, a text message or email from the NHS showing a lateral flow result to get into a venue.Firms failing to check Covid passes properly may be fined £, and up to £, for repeat offences.But Boris Johnson is facing a major backlash to the plan as Tory backbenchers look set to vote against the plan. The PM may get the changes though parliament with Labour support but given he is under major pressure over the Christmas parties plan, the rules could be watered down.  So far, there are no limits on travel, household mixing and meeting groups of people. Downing Street has also rejected calls to put new restrictions on hospitality venues, so your Christmas party can still go ahead. What about a aposPlan Capos  Officially, there is no Plan C. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said on Friday there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already.But Omicron could change things, and Health Secretary Sajid Javid is under pressure to bring in more stringent measures before Christmas.Further measures could include hospitality check-ins, tougher isolation rules, face masks in all indoor venues and further vaccine passport rules.

No insisted Plan B is the right approach Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Dec | commentsSchools will be the very last thing to shutnew Covid restrictions are needed in England, Downing Street said today. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman insisted there were “no plans” to shut schools in England and Plan B measures are the “right balance”. But Nicola Sturgeon may announce more restrictions in Scotland tomorrow, and Whitehall officials have been reportedly been drawing up tighter curbs for England. Draft plans - unconfirmed - are said to include limiting pubs and restaurants to outdoor dining. And the PM today refused three times to rule out bringing in tighter restrictions before Christmas Day. That has sparked speculation about whether there will be further closures to battle the Omicron iant - despite Noaposs insistence that is not the plan.  Questioned by journalists, Mr Johnson’s official spokesman suggested pubs and restaurants would shut before schoolsneeded. Askedhospitality venues would close before schools, he replied: “I wouldn’t run through the list of exactly in what order we would bring things in. “But it’s certainly true to say that we would always seek to restrict access to face-to-face education very last.” The spokesman said students can be sent homethere’s an outbreak but we wouldn’t want to see it happening as a precaution or a matter of routine”. He added: Moving away from face to face schooling was always one of the last things we did, and only when it was an absolute public health emergency.” The spokesman said the government had “only restricted it [schooling] when there’s the direst public health emergency”, adding: “There’s certainly no plans to do that. We think we’ve got the right balance through Plan B and our big uptick in boosters.” It came as NHS England ed to its highest level of emergency preparedness, a level  national incident. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the Omicron iant accounts for more than % of cases in London and is expected to become the dominant strain “within the next  hours”.He told MPs that due to a lag between sickness and death, hospitalisations and deaths with Omicron - currently  and  - are set to “dramatically increase in the days and weeks that lie ahead”. Mr Javid confirmed he will go ahead with plans to replace isolation for Covid contacts with daily lateral flow testing from tomorrow. Despite the government’s website running out of rapid testing packs, he insisted there were enough in the state’s supplies. He added people should “check the website the following day”they cannot order one today. Mr Javid added the NHS Covid pass was being rolled out to  to  year olds for purposes of international travel from today. As the crisis worsens ahead of Christmas, the Government is said to be drawing up a raft of more stringent potential measures. England’s health officials have been drawing up a so-called aposPlan Capos - and an even more draconian aposPlan D’ to tackle the tidal wave of omicron spreading across the country. They could bring back Covid pass checking-in the hospitality sector, require firms to only serve food and drinks outdoors, or even force pubs and restaurants to shut their doors entirely. In Scotland, the nation’s Health Secretary said stricter rules are inevitable due to the spread of the new iant north of the border. Mr Johnson was quizzed by broadcasters after warning that cases of omicron are doubling every two to three days. The PM gave a televised address to the nation on Sunday night, where he said two doses of a vaccine is simply not enough to prevent the spread of omicron - and the NHS could soon be overwhelmed. In a massive escalation of the jabs rollout, he committed to offer a booster to every adult in England by the end of the year - a month earlier than planned. But chief medical officer Chris Whitty only said they would be offered an appointment by then. No insisted the PM’s version was right. People will be able to have their Covid boosters on Christmas Day, No claimed. Keir Starmer will address the nation tonight at pm in response to the PMaposs statement on Covid. The Labour leader will make a rare statement via a pre-recorded message on BBC One speaking directly to the British people.  The NHS will have to postpone thousands of appointments to meet the target of giving every adult in England a Covid booster jab by the end of the year. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said people with cancer symptoms would unaffected by the ersion of NHS resources to the vaccine rollout - but non-urgent care would be impacted. Mr Javid also said he could not guarantee schools would not be forced to close again due to the virus. Askedthis was still a possibility, he told LBC: Well, I donapost want to see that or any of these kinds of measures. Iaposm just going to focus on everything  we need to be doing, especially the booster programme. The reintroduction of work from home guidance appears to have had an an immediate impact after reports of a sharp fall in road traffic and passenger numbers on buses and trains. Mr Johnson faces a mass Tory revolt tomorrow over plans to force Englandaposs nightclub and event punters to show Covid passes - with vaccination or a negative test - from am on Wednesday.

Marcus Fysh is expected to be among more than  Tory rebels tomorrow when MPs vote on forcing many venues to ask punters for proof of a vaccine or negative test.In September Mr Fysh voted in favour of the Elections Bill, which will force voters to show ID at polling stations.But today he told BBC Radio  Live: “You are segregating society based on an unacceptable thing.“We are not a ‘papers please’ society. This is not Nazi Germany, okay ” Told there was a “long way” between a regime that systematically murdered millions and taking a test before going to a nightclub, he replied: “It’s the thin end of an authoritarian wedge and that’s why we will resist it.” Jewish Labour MP Margaret Hodge tweeted: “When will we ever learn “Letaposs hope  is the year when we stop making flippant comparisons to the Nazis.” Barrister Adam Wagner, an expert on Covid laws, said: “Itaposs certainly not Nazi Germany, where there was state-sponsored mass murder, ghettos, torture, death camps and the literal dehumanisation and genocide of entire ethnic and other groups. “Letaposs not inadvertently trivialise this important debate through ridiculous comparisons.”  Labour MP Alex Sobel added: “Utterly Shameful. “Maybe Marcus might want to rethink his votes on stripping people of their citizenship, banning the right to protest and requiring ID to vote stripping many of their democratic rights. “Finally only compare Nazis to actual Nazis.” Boris Johnson ’s ‘Plan B’ will bar those who are not double-jabbed - or prepared to take a Covid test and show the negative result - from certain venues in England from am on Wednesday.It will apply to anywhere open beyond am indoor venues with more than  people unseated outdoor venues with more than , people and any venue with more than , people.Originally unvaccinated people would have been banned. But Boris Johnson announced a compromise in which theyaposll be able to take a lateral flow test and show the result, either through the NHS app or through a text or email from the NHS testing service. But more than  Conservative MPs are said to be prepared to vote down Plan B measures, which also include retrospective approval for face mask laws in England that began on Friday. Mr Fysh told BBC Radio  Live: “We live in a free society in this country. “A ‘papers please’ society is an authoritarian state that we should all absolutely resist.” He became embroiled in a row with presenter Rachel Burden, who suggested people want the “freedom not to be infected”. He replied: “Look, we are very well vaccinated in this country. It’s been a great success. People have the freedom to do what they want with their own bodies and the freedom of association.  “Andyou want to undo those things, you’re not worthy of working for the BBC in my opinion.” Ms Burden replied “that’s quite a personal statement”, and she was simply “putting across the case that many of our listeners have” that they don’t want to go to a pubthey’ll be at risk. Mr Fysh replied: “Well don’t go. Don’t go then. You don’t tell other people what they should do with their bodies. Sorry, don’t do it.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyNHSPlan BBoris JohnsonPoliticsNazisCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Arfan Ullah, , shared a keypad code he had kept after being dismissed, enabling the thieves to sneak into the store and loot passengeraposs luggage which had been lost during transit, Birmingham Live reports. As part of the overnight robbery at Manchester Airport, the gang even posed as holidaymakers, to make it appear they were the legitimate owners of the suitcases and bags they were stealing. They booked a taxi to and from the airport to aid their getaways in plain sight, with the cab drivers unaware the luggage they were packing into the boot and back of their vehicles were stolen. In two raids, three hours apart, the gang used the same suitcases they had stolen earlier to load up more items from the store. They later met at a rendezvous point to split the goods. Staff at Excess Baggage Group Ltd - which had fired Ullah the previous month - only discovered the thefts when they clocked in for duty the next day. They played back CCTV to see a total of five men pilfering the unit. It is thought a total of  people were involved in pulling off the raid. Ullah, who had gambling issues, was arrested along with two other suspects, after one of the taxi drivers was traced by police. Officials at the lost property office based at Terminal One were unable to quanty the value of the items missing. It emerged members of the group had attended the unit two weeks before the overnight raid. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Ullah, now a university student of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, and warehouse worker Nikash Sultan, , of Birmingham, admitted burglary and were freed with  month community orders. Both were ordered to pay £ each, in compensation towards the missing luggage. Ateeb Qaiser, , of Manchester, did not attend the hearing due to testing positive for Covid and will instead be sentenced on December  - he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit a burglary at an earlier hearing. The raid occurred on March , , just four weeks after Ullah was let go by the lost property company. Prosecutor Miss Helena Williams said: Mr Ullah was in his probationary period and his performance was not satisfactory. Excess Baggage Group company, at Manchester Airport, collects lost property at the terminals and any items not claimed are moved to longer term storage overnight. The entrance for the burglary was at the car park located in terminal one. The door is unmarked and assessed by using a keypad lock. It seems Mr Ullah was given the keypad access code on February  - the day before he was let go. On the night of the incident itself, the last member of staff left at .pm and the premises were locked and secured. But a staff member the following day noticed a number of items had been disturbed. CCTV footage was recovered during that evening which showed there were two entries, the first at .pm and the second at .am in the early hours of the following morning. It can be seen on the first entry that two males entered the room and obtained access by using the code. They then left with luggage items and ed to a taxi. At .am three males ed to the room with the same suitcases they had took the night before. The taxi was traced and the driver admitted to taking three males to the airport. Two males left the taxi but a third male remained inside the taxi. He thought nothing of it. From the CCTV footage, it would seem Ateeb Qaiser was present during both entries. The first time he entered the premises with both males, but the other two males were not these two other defendants. He then acts as the lookout on the second occasion but it is not clearhe is with these two other males. Sultan was at the airport with Qaiser - they are seen getting out of a taxi and using an ATM. Mr Ullah was not present on either occasion, but he played a role in planning the incident and provided the door codes. There were a huge number of items missing however, there are no accurate figures placed on the items taken by these defendants. Enquiries show one mobile phone was in regular contact with another phone and Mr Ullahaposs phone had regular contact with aposNickapos which was Mr Sultanaposs phone. Mr Qaiser and Mr Ullah sent seven tests and  calls. They were in frequent contact. There is evidence that they met up in Oldham the next day. Inquiries showed on February , they went to the unit which shows there was some degree of planning. Mr Ullah and Mr Qaiser did not answer any questions in the interview. Mr Sultan confirmed he was known as aposNickapos but largely did not answer any questions. We cannot place any figure on the items lost. In mitigation for Ullah, defence counsel Hunter Gray said: He is deeply ashamed of his actions. He was immature at the time and has issues with gambling and misusing alcohol. He has not tried to excuse his behaviour and has taken steps to address his behaviour. He is currently studying at university and has ambitions for the future. He has been interviewed for a job as a hotel receptionist and is hopeful of getting that job. He is at a low risk of reoffending. This will be the first and the last time he is before the court. For Sultan, David Morton said: He was only present on the second occasion of these two trips. He is now working in a Sainsburyaposs warehouse but he needs to find his future and establish a trust with his colleagues. Finances are extremely tight for him. Sentencing Judge Tina Landale said: This burglary was planned and was extensive and there were up to  people involved. Vehicles and taxis were used to get away. Ullah, you had a signicant and crucial role. You used your knowledge of working there, which was a gross breach of trust. You provided the key codes to the premises and a high value of goods were stolen and these were targeted. It has not been possible to know the value or the quantity, but a large number of items were taken. It was clear you had been involved in communication in planning with Qaiser in advance of the burglary. In addition to the compensation fee, Ullah was also ordered to complete  hours unpaid work. Sultan must undertake  hours unpaid work.

The Government Communications Headquarters have officially unveiled their  Christmas card from their director, Sir Jeremy Fleming, and much like previous cards, there is another festive brainteaser to crack hidden within the card. However, this year there’s a twist – as the seven puzzles have been specially designed for  to -year-olds to try. Sir Jeremy’s cards are traditionally sent to National Security colleagues and partners across the world who work alongside GCHQ every day to counter organised crime gangs, terror groups and hostile states looking to do the UK harm.

If we’re to help keep the country safe, problem-solving skills and teamwork are absolutely crucial. “That’s why this year’s Christmas puzzles are aimed at young people. I am keen to encourage STEM skills, thinking dferently, and help foster the next generation of talent. “I want to show young people that thinking dferently is a gt, and it is only with a mix of minds that they can solve seemingly impossible problems, just like we do at GCHQ.” To support greater take up of STEMsubjects, particularly among young girls, GCHQ has partnered with the organisation Stemettes on several activities over the last few years. And CEO of Stemettes, Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon, is eager to see young girls try and tackle GCHQ’s Christmas Challenge. She said: “No matter your age, STEM skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving are important skills to have. In my work across the Stemettes with partners like GCHQ, we want all kinds of people to have the chance to explore these skills, and for those that enjoy this type of challenge to get an opportunity to further themselves in these areas. “GCHQ’s Christmas Challenge is a fun festive way to do this, and I’d encourage schools and those who work with children to explore this type of activity as another way to engage the next generation in some light-hearted STEM fun.”You can download the GCHQ Christmas Challenge on the GCHQ website, and the solutions will be posted on their Twitter and Instagram channels.

He added: I thought a bunker bar would be something dferent to the typical bars people usually build in their gardens. Itaposs something outside the box and also has the wow factor because itaposs not something you see all the time. After originally joking with the builder I wanted an underground bar, one week later they started digging out the hole in the ground.  My favourite thing about the bar is that no one knows itaposs there. Itaposs got a shed above it so itaposs well disguised. The structure was completed in around six weeks and we spent around £k on the materials for the bunker. One of the biggest challenges of the build was keeping the water out and weatherproofing the top of the bunker.  The secret bunker bar also doubles up as a cinema room where Jody and his family also enjoy watching films as on one side of the room there is a widescreen television. There is also a screen that drops down from the ceiling which Jody uses for watching sports. The -year-old, from Wakefied, West Yorkshire said: The bar was a godsend during the many lockdowns. It was great to have a lovely space we could appreciate and enjoy as a family. My kids love the bar. Theyaposre always down there having parties with their friends or watching movies.  My we enjoys it too, although Iaposm not sure she enjoys how often I am down there watching football. When we have people over they are blown away by the bunker when they see it. Itaposs not every day you get to go into an underground bar. There bar consists of a booth seating area in the corner, a bar at one end of the room with draft lager and cider. Thereaposs also a couple of sofas and a table in the middle.  The dad has spent money creating a space where he can invite friends and neighbours round for a few beers while they watch all the top games. He has splashed out on the decor and it is now like a home from home where he can enjoy watching his favourite team. It also has the benefit of being secluded and sound does not travel because it is underground and causes no noise nuisance to non footie fans.  Itaposs quite glamorously decorated and I also have a few bits of sports memorabilia on display too. Itaposs great for us when we have friends around because you can have the music on louder because people canapost hear it as we are underground. So we canapost upset the neighbours which is always a plus.

Footage shows the steady-handed expert save the three-month old Jetta, a German Shepherd, after she guzzled the stone while playing in her owner’s garden.The poochaposs owner noticed the pup was struggling to breathe and rushed her to the vets, Coventry Live reports. Staff at Avonvale Veterinary Centre, Stratford-upon-Avon, took an X-ray which showed the pebble was stuck in her windpipe. Vets made several attempts to remove the slippery rock unsuccessfully and clinical director Simon Davies dashed to help from an animal hospital in Warwick. The footage shows Mr Davies using a videoscope to locate the pebble before carefully removing it from the pupaposs airway. Vet Sarah Ives told CoventryLive: “Jetta arrived in a collapsed state and was gasping for breath.“We straight away provided oxygen therapy and tried to ascertain what was causing the obstruction. “As we couldnapost see anything obvious, we decided to intubateand examine her under general anaesthetic. “Jetta’s colour immediately improved and she was stable enough for us to take an X-ray. “We very quickly found the problem. There was a stone wedged in her bronchibut fortunately it had only blocked one side of her airways, so she was still able to pass some air. “It remained a serious situation, though, so we called our clinical director Simon Davies, who came over from our Warwick animal hospital to help deal with the case. “He arrived with a videoscope which he passed down Jetta’s throat to locate the stone and carefully retrieve it. “It was quite a dficult procedure, as the stone was very smooth and kept sliding away from the instrument he was using to try and secure it. “We all let out a cheer and breathed a sigh of relief when he did manage to grasp the stone and carefully pull it up and out of Jetta’s airway. “Jetta improved quickly. She was put on a course on antibiotics and was allowed back home to her grateful family that evening. “She’s one very lucky girl as it was the team’s quick thinking and actions which very much saved Jettaaposs le.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsTherapyDogsTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Heres how you can secure yourself home testing kits in light of the test shortagesNews of the shortage comes at the worst possible time Image: DAILY RECORDByHarry Thompson:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | comments As the Omicron iant takes hold, Brits are flocking to vaccination centres and making sure they are tested regularly to ensure their Christmas plans run smoothly.However, today the NHS website ran out of lateral flow tests with people being urged to try again tomorrow or to head to their local pharmacy. The tests are now unavailable on official websites in the UK, leaving people having to either make do with what they have or scramble to find them in pharmacies and other distributors. Double vaccinated contacts of people who have tested positive for the Omicron iant are told to test every day for a week instead of isolate. The timing is made worse by Covid passes for many venues and events requiring unvaccinated people to use lateral flow tests as an alternative method for entry. How to get Lateral Flow tests For those scrambling to get hold of precious lateral flow tests, the best thing to do is to use the NHSaposs dedicated postcode checker, which will inform users of nearby centres both to collect home tests or to get tested.The service will provide information about the centreaposs opening times and whether it is a test site or a collection point. It also provides a status on whether it is open or not, an address and instructions on how to get there. The UK Health Security Agencysaid: Everyone who needs a lateral flow test can collect test kits - either at their local pharmacy, some community sites and some schools and colleges. Due to exceptionally high demand, ordering lateral flow tests on gov.uk has been temporarily suspended to fulfil existing orders.The UKHSAaposs message was somewhat confused by Prime Minister Boris Johnson half an hour before when he said there was a ready supply of lateral flow tests available.It also goes without saying that people should frequently check back on the government website for updates. Why has the government website run out lateral flow tests  The availability of tests appears to have been put on hold while the government catches up with fulfilling pre-existing orders after exceptionally high demand. Speaking to Sky News, a Whitehall spokesperson said: We have plenty of tests, people can continue to get them from pharmacies and other sites. We have seen a surge in demand and that is putting pressure on the delivery system rather than stock levels of home test kits. However, Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader said: The governmentaposs inability to procure properly and plan for civil contingencies is reckless. Boris Johnson has his priorities in the wrong place.

The new strain isexpected to surpass Delta as the dominant iant within  hours in London. Scientists believe Omicron is more transmissible than previous iants, although no solid conclusions have been drawn yet as to whether or not it is more dangerous than its predecessor.At the time of writing  people in the UK have been admitted to hospital with it, with reports that a patient has died in the UK after testing positive with Omicron.As it stands, the huge rollout of Covid booster jabs remains the only meaningful tactic for tackling Omicron. Scotland and Wales are aiming to offer the booster to all people by the end of the year, while Northern Ireland is also ramping up efforts by now offering walk-ins to over s. What has changed in the Covid booster jab roll-out plan   The original plan laid out that all adults eligible for a booster would be offered one by the end of January, however, the goalposts have now been brought forward, with the aim to now have achieved this by the end of . Eligible adults include all over-s who had their second jab at least three months ago. A joint statement issued by the Chief Medical Officers of the four home nations said: “Transmission of Covid- is already high in the community, mainly still driven by Delta, but the emergence of Omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services. Vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from Omicron is reduced… hospitalisations from Omicron are already occurring and these are likely to increase rapidly.” How many jabs a day will be needed for the government to meet the target  The government is now aiming to jab one million people per day, double the previous target of , per day and dwarfing the , per day before that. Saturdays tend to see the most people going for jabs, with , getting theirs on Saturday, December .

The rush of young people trying to get jabbed before heading home for Christmas has prompted y queues and issues with booking sites for those eligible.

Louis sits cross-legged in front of his mum. And according to body language expert Darren Stanton, Kate placing her hand on her husbandaposs knee is a signicant part of the photo. He tells Coffee Friend : It’s quite a flirtatious gesture for any photo - especially one that depicts a r oyal family and the future of the monarchy.If anything, it reinforces the love the couple have for one another and William shows his approval by placing his hand on Kate’s leg. Such a personal move, almost restricted for romantic partners, again displays just how in sync the pair are as they match and mirror each other perfectly.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.Meanwhile, Darren also notes that the image shows the family were genuinely enjoying a very happy time on their travels and that Princess Charlotte may have a dferent personality from her siblings.He adds: The first thing that strikes me about the photo is that everybody pictured is flashing a genuine smile - so often in photographs, no matter how important the person being photographed is, fake smiles are shown and faces can seem very disingenuous.  In this particular picture, everyone is displaying genuine emotion, which would suggest it’s a very happy time for the family right now. Kate always flashes a great smile, her whole face is engaged and her crow’s feet - the three lines at the side of the eyes - are visible, which denotes a genuine smile and it is congruent with how open and inviting the rest of her body language is.  Her maternal intuition beams through, as she has her hand on the back of Prince George in a reassuring way. While the two princes, George and Louis, have adopted the same pose and position with their arms and legs - mirroring each other, Princess Charlotte sits with a slightly more turned posture suggesting she has a dferent personality to her siblings. And Darren says the choice of this snap could give an insight into how William and Kate see their place in the monarchy - especially as last yearaposs card was so dferent. He explains: Kate and Will’s choice in photo could be anyone’s holiday family snap. It signies that the royal couple are going to be very much their own people. While they still make sure to be respectful of royal protocols in place, they show a keenness to bring the monarchy into the st Century and establish a more personal connection with the public and the public with them.

Footage of the shocking incident captured by Patricia’s neighbour’s doorbell camera and shared online showed McCafferty standing over Patricia as she let out a moan, before saying something to the postie.  But in response, McCafferty said “I canapost help you pal” and proceeded to explain that he was apostoo knackeredapos to assist the pensioner after her fall. He then left the stricken OAP without even calling for help. Thankfully, -year-old Hermes driver Karolina Domska found Mrs Stewart crying in the snow  minutes after the fall and helped her back into her house.  Mrs Stewartaposs family fear she could have died in the freezing conditions, with the pensioner - who walks with a Zimmer frame - suffering from bone disease osteoporosis. Niece Sheryl Harkins said: What this gentleman did is disgusting. He deserves everything he is going to get. He shouldnapost be working with the public. Grandmother-of-two Patricia, who lives alone, said she felt dizzy and fell from the top step, banging her head.  With the postman ignoring her pleas for help, she said she feared she might have been lying there for hours.At the timePatricia told The Sun: Twenty minutes I was shouting aposhelpapos and I was crying.I was lying partly in the snow and I banged my head. She added: Evenhe was knackered, at the end of the day thataposs his job. The gran said she was left with a lump the size of an egg on her head following the incident. Ms Harkins previously said she was still awaiting an apology from the postman.An investigation was launched by the Royal Mail and McCafferty was initiallysuspended , while an area manager later visited Ms Stewart to apologise in person and bring her chocolates. At the time, the company said it expects the highest standards of behaviour from employees.

The -year-old from Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, put himself to the test of eating the most festive bakes in one sitting. The ,-calorie meal was tough going on Kyle soon after heaposd demolished his tenth pastry, but he journeyed on even treating himself to six mince pies as a dessert. The whopping .kg haul cost a total of £, leaving Kyle stuffed.  He said: The festive bakes only come out once a year, so I thought Iaposd give it a try. Theyaposre actually really good, but after the tenth one it just all started to go downhill from there. They were just so dry and flaky, and it got monotonous just eating the same thing over and over again. After eating them, I never wanted to eat one again.  Kyle relishes eating challenges and uses eating as an an endurance test which he can prove he has won. He plans future eating tests and is looking forward to more seasonal food as Christmas approaches. His next target is mince pies which he plans to film on video and before heading to the gym once he has completed the task. Since scoffing  festive bakes, Kyle hopes to do more Greggs challenges in the future like trying to see how many sausage rolls he can eat in one sitting.He said: Iaposve been doing challenges like this for the past five years. So once I do them, I go into a food coma for a little while but burn it all off at the gym and by eating low calorie meals on normal days. Iaposm looking forward to Christmas, and Iaposm even planning on doing another festive video of eating about  mince pies in  minutes.

The -year-old medicine counter assistant told NottinghamshireLive : I was so shocked.I expected so much more for £. There was literally one slice of bacon in it which was majority fat and no butter.

Fatiha Sabrin, , was found unresponsive in her home in Shadwell, east London, yesterday afternoon before being rushed to hospital, reportedly alongside her mother and brother. The childaposs death is being treated as unexplained and the Met said a special post-mortem examination will be scheduled in due course, reports MyLondon.Other residents of the building also reported feeling unwell and a full evacuation took place. Toni Santos Babi, a resident in the block, said: I and my flatmates smelled a strange smell in our flat, and I had a headache, and they had a cough and throat ache for the last two days.  He explained: Around pm firefighters came into my flat to measure levels of some chemicals and they found a higher number in the toilet. After the evacuation, the London Fire Brigade swept the building and discovered a quantity of chemicals believed to be used for pest control. Sabbir Ahmad, a family friend, said the Fatihaaposs father has been stuck in an airport since the tragedy happened as he was in Bangladesh on a business trip. Describing Fatiha, Sabbir said: She was a very bright girl. She was in my home eight or nine days ago and were discussing her future plans. She was very responsive and told me she wanted to be a doctor, and wanted to make something very good of her le. She was also a great writer, she received awards for her writing skills. Zara Rahman, headteacher of Buttercup Primary School, said Fatiha’s brother - thought to be aged seven - was back in school on Monday. But she is awaiting updates on the children’s mother who remains in hospital. Ms Rahman said Fatiha’s brother is “confused and in shock”. “He hasn’t seen either of his parents, his mum is still in hospital so we don’t know what happened,” she added. Asked when she first heard about the incident, she said “immediately”. “It was a shock, you don’t expect to hear that about a fit and healthy child. “Police said a chemical gas was found in the building. It didn’t make sense, it was like something out of a film, it’s just so unfortunate. You always expect all pupils toback to school on Monday safe.” A police car remains at the scene outside Nida House, which was evacuated following the incident. Most of the building’s windows are open and a cordon remains in place. One bouquet of flowers has been laid next to the block’s main door.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Hospitalspolitan Police ServiceEmergency\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of York was spotted horse riding on the country estate near the Queen’s Windsor Castle home, chortling along with two palace stable workers. His new Hollywood hotshot lawyer Andrew Brettler is in place to meet the deadline set by a New York court by the end of the day, responding to allegations the Duke sexually abused a -year-old girl in . However, it is still expected that Andrew will be forced to face a civil trial in the United States against his accuser Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was forced to have sex with the royal on three occasions in . Ms Giuffre, who is now , was allegedly trafficked around the world by Andrew’s late paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein, who took his own le in a jail cell last year as he awaited trial on a catalogue of sex crimes.  The Duke’s legal team have previously labelled her, as a money grabber who is suing the Queen’s son “to achieve another payday at his expense”. Ms Giuffre has accused the Duke of sexually abusing her at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion as well as his private Caribbean island Epstein, and at the London home of his lover Ghislaine Maxwell who is currently in a New York jail awaiting sex abuse and grooming charges. She is claiming damages for emotional harm and distress which could run into millions of poundssuccessful.  An onlooker who saw the Duke out riding on Monday said: “Considering he is facing a civil trial on very serious allegations, he looked like he didn’t have a care in the world. “He was laughing and joking with his riding companions and enjoying himself.” US judge Lewis Kaplan will on January  for the last time examine both submissions from the prosecution and is expected to call for a trial to begin next autumn. Sources close to the Duke have revealed he has recently been “staying up late” and “working on US time” to speak to his lawyers who are based in Calornia. The Duke’s case preparations have also been marred by infighting between his UK solicitor Gary Bloxsome and Mr Brettler, allegedly due to a “severe clash in personalities”. Mr Brettler is understood to have been “entirely unimpressed with the state of affairs” when he was hired at the eleventh hour in October after Andrew failed to dismiss the abuse claims against him, sources have disclosed. Meanwhile, it emerged on Sunday how Prince Andrew has had little or no discussion over his legal woes with senior royals, including the -year-old Queen who has agreed to pick up his vastly expensive legal bills. Until recently Andrew had “remained utterly convinced” he would still be able to join Her Majesty and the rest of the family for the public celebrations for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. But royal aides ruled will not appear at any public events or join them on the Buckingham Palace balcony for an RAF flypast. The prince has consistently denied Ms Giuffreaposs claims and, in , told BBC Twoaposs Newsnight programme: I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.

And Prince Harry once revealed the Christmas present she bought his two-year-old son Archie last year - and it was just what he wanted. But the unusual gt, which the Queen ordered and had sent to the Sussexesapos home in LA after it was suggested by Meghan Markle, left TV host James Corden completely baffled when Harry revealed what it was during an interview for The Late Late Show earlier this year.As the duo took an open-top bus tour of the city, James asked Harry about fatherhood, his new le in America and quitting the royal family.  Speaking about the Queenaposs gt, he said: My grandmother asked us what Archie wanted for Christmas, and Meg said a waffle maker. So she sent us a waffle maker for Archie, so breakfast now Meg makes up a beautul organic mix, in the waffle maker, flip it, out it comes. He loves it. And now I have waffles for breakfast, bit of yoghurt, bit of jam on top. I donapost knowthataposs the right thing to do. Berries, bit of honey.

James interrupted him, saying: Sorry youaposre glossing over the fact that I cannot for the le of me imagine the Queen ordering a waffle maker to be sent to Santa Barbara. I canapost get my head around it. Harry replies: I donapost even know how to comment on that. Archie wakes up in the morning and literally just goes aposwaffle apos.This year, Harry and Meghan will be spending their first Christmas as a family of four after they welcomed daughter Lilibet in June.And as well as likely receiving gts from the Queen, one royal expert says Archie and Lilibet can also expect presents from their aunt and uncle Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge.Archie and Lilibet are likely to spend the festive season in Calornia with their parents while William and Kate will be at Sandringham with their children George, Charlotte and Louis.In recent months, much has been made of the rt between brothers William and Harry and in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March, Harry claimed William was trapped within the royal system - which is said to have left William furious.William and Kate are yet to meet their niece Lilibet in person.But when OK! magazine asked royal expert and author Katie NichollWilliam and Kate would be buying Christmas gts to send to America for Archie and Lilibet, she said: Yes, of course.They give gts to the whole family and that includes all of their nieces and nephews. This means also buying presents for Kateaposs sister Pippaaposs children - three-year-old Arthur and eight-month-old Grace.

But two-year-old Dollie is being compared to Princess Rapunzel for the similarities in their luscious long locks. The little girl made headlines when she was born with an extraordinary thick head of hair, and two years later her locks are even more impressive - growing all the way to the bottom of her back. Her mum, Katie Canham, , says strangers now continuously compare her young tot to Rapunzel whenever they catch a glimpse of her locks. But Dollieaposs brothers and sisters - Archie, , Ellie, , Reggie,  and Sonnie,  - donapost share her impressive hair. Dollie, from Bromley in South London, got her first haircut when she was just three months old - and Katie now dedicates almost half an hour each morning to styling her daughteraposs hair. Katie said: It reaches all the way down to the bottom of her back now. Iaposve never seen a toddler with hair like this before. People always say to us that she is like a little Rapunzel because of how much hair she has. And then when I tell them that she is two, they just canapost believe it. Katie went to state that strangers often fail to believe Dollie is only two years old as she looks much older than her actual age due to the apossheer amount of hair she hasapos. She continued: Peopleaposs reaction is funny. But she loves her long hair and so do I. Katie expresses that her daughteraposs hair can be quite a challenge to deal with in the morning, as it tends to get very knotty. Andshe is tasked with also washing her hair, that then adds another  minutes to the  minutes she already spends styling - but admits her daughter does enjoy the pampering session. ButDollie could have her way with styling her hair, sheaposd leave it all down - something her mum just canapost allow it. She added: But I canapost let her have it down all the time because of how knotted it gets, and she sometimes gets things stuck in it. Katie admits she has enjoyed going to YouTube to watch hair tutorials to teach her new style for Dollie.

Little Josie Gordon, who was  months old, was on the first day of a family holiday at a campsite in Cornwall when she was killed by the caravan towed by her grandfather. Police investigators believe Josie had either been standing close to the caravan when it began moving, and was knocked down, or had put herself on the floor and was run over. The injuries to her head and chest were so severe she died almost instantaneously, despite receiving prompt medical attention. Cornwall Coroneraposs Court heard Josie and her parents, Harry Gordon and Hannah Bingham, had set off from their home on the morning of May  this year in their VW campervan. They were meeting family members, including Josieaposs grandparents, Ian and Bethan Gordon, for a week-long break on The Lizard peninsula.  In a written statement, Ms Bingham said the accident happened in a matter of seconds while Josie jumped around in the puddles in her wellies. I had a good view of everything and could see Josie was just playing in the puddles at the back of Ian and Bethanaposs caravan - she was having the time of her le, she said. It felt like the car and caravan had been moving for a couple of seconds when the caravan, moving, passed me and once it moved passed, I instantly saw Josie on the ground of the gravel track. It literally felt like seconds from seeing her in the puddle to then seeing her on the floor. I didnapost see what or how she came to be on the floor. All I saw was the car and caravan move forwards and suddenly she was on the floor. Harry shouted, aposJosieaposs on the floorapos and Ian instantly stopped the car. Harry scooped her up and I donapost think we realised how bad it was. I was just telling that mummyaposs here, and I was trying to keep her warm and I kissed her hands. I think I knew deep down she wasnapost okay, but I didnapost want to believe what I thought. Miss Bingham added: I donapost know what happened in the seconds between seeing her playing and seeing her on the ground. I wondered whether she crawled underneath the caravan to get something. Josieaposs father said as the car pulled away the caravan rocked side to side asit had run over something and then realised his daughter was on the floor. When he was told Josie had died, he said: I thought this wasnapost real. I was in total disbelief about what happened. In a statement, Josieaposs grandfather said he had checked his wing mirrors before pulling away and did not see anything or feel any impact. I was moving forward and only had been doing that for a few seconds when I heard Harry shout, aposJosieaposs been run over by the caravanapos, he said. Mr Gordon said in a subsequent victim personal statement that the death of his only grandchild had left him with painful remorse and constant grief. Pc Scott Robinson, who investigated the accident, told the inquest that due to Josieaposs height she was probably not seen by her grandfather. Josie has been knocked under the caravan and become injured when the caravan began to move over her, he said. It is also possible that Josie had no perception of danger at the time the caravan was stationary and had put herself under the caravan, becoming injured when the caravan began to move. I am not able to say from the evidence which of these scenarios is most likely. A post-mortem examination found she had suffered fatal head and chest injuries consistent with being run over by the wheel of the caravan. Andrew Cox, senior coroner for Cornwall, recorded a conclusion Josie had died as a result of a road traffic collision. By any description this is a tragic set of circumstances and I cannot begin to imagine how dficult this has been for all the members of the family, particularly Josieaposs parents, he said. It seems to me the two alternatives put forward by Pc Robinson are entirely sensible and I accept one of them is likely to be the cause for this incident. Tragically, Mr Gordon has not seen Josie and she hasnapost appreciated the danger of the situation and while playing innocently this tragedy has unfolded in a matter of a few seconds. I have only the deepest sympathy for all those involved in this incident. In a statement issued after the inquest, Josieaposs parents said: Josie was a happy, vibrant, beautul force of nature, whose le was tragically taken in the worst of circumstances. She will be eternally cherished by all of us and, in particular, her loving parents. The sunshine she brought to all our lives will last forever.

The Plan B measures also included mandatory face coverings in most indoor venues from Friday as well as vaccine passports for nightclubs and other large events from December .However, on Friday Downing Street confirmed there was growing evidence that the Omicron iant of Covid spreads faster than the Delta iant. This has led to questions on whether Plan B will be enough to control the spread of the new iant and rumours of officials drawing up a ‘Plan C’ with tougher rules.What is the governmentaposs Covid Plan C and when could it be triggered   Right now there is no official Plan C.While the governmentaposs Covid Winter Plan published in September included Plan B, which Boris Johnson has now triggered, an official spokesperson for the Prime Minister confirmed that there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already.He added that he is not aware of any specic Plan C document but said: As a responsible Government, of course, you would expect us to... we have an array, already, of options available to us in terms of what measures we can take to mitigate a growth of any iant or virus. While Plan C is still not official, further contingency plans seem imminent especially with UKaposs top medics recommending that the nation move into level four Covid alert.The government has not yet revealed the thresholds that could trigger the new restrictions. But based on previous lockdowns and throughout the pandemic one of the major aims of restrictions is to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed due to Covid admissions.Another key factor is how well vaccines work against the new iant, particularly given the concerns that Omicron can evade vaccine immunity. What restrictions would be introduced under Covid Plan C  NHS Covid app  People could be asked to use the NHS Covid app to check into pubs and restaurants to help with contact tracing. This rule was in place just after the lockdown, when the hospitality venues opened up, but it was later abandoned due to the “pingdemic,” when thousands of people were told to isolate, leading to staff shortages. In August, the rules were also changed so that double jabbed people didn’t need to isolatepinged by the app. Instead they were asked to take a PCR test. Face masks in all indoor spaces Under Plan B, the rule on face coverings applies to most indoor spaces including theatres, cinemas, shops and public transport. Though current restrictions give exemptions for activities like eating, exercising or singing, any further restrictions could see face masks become mandatory even in hospitality settings as well.Vaccine passports in smaller venuesPeople will need to prove they are double jabbed or that they have tested negative for Covid for entry into nightclubs and other large scale events like football matches, starting from December . Under Plan C, this maybe expanded to smaller venues like pubs too, though the government has said it is reluctant to do so. Isolation rules tightened Self-isolation rules were changed in the summer so that those who were double jabbed no longer had to self-isolate at home for  daysthey came into contact with an infected person. After Omicron began spreading, the rules were adjusted so that anyone who had been in contact with infected person had to isolate regardless of the vaccination status. This -day rule and any further changes on self-isolation could be unpopular, but may make an impact in controlling cases.

What is the level  UK Covid Alert and why has it been raised from level    Increasing the UK Covid alert from three to four means that the epidemic is “in general circulation, transmission is high and direct Covid- pressure on healthcare services is widespread and substantial or rising”, according to Government guidance. The statement from UK’s four chief medical officers and Professor Powis read: Transmission of Covid- is already high in the community, mainly still driven by Delta, but the emergence of Omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services.  It also said that there has been early evidence of Omicron spreading faster than Delta and evading vaccine protection, adding that hospitalisations due to the iant are already occurring and “likely to increase rapidly. The last time that the UK Covid alert level was at four was between late February and May in .What do the dferent alert levels mean  The Covid alert system which was unveiled by the government in May  has five levels that assess the risk of the virus on the basis of Covid-’s reproductionrate. This measures how fast itaposs spreading. The five levels are :Level five – the red level, which signies a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed Level four – the amber level, showing high or rising levels of transmission Level three – indicating that the virus is in general circulation Level two – showing the number of cases and transmission are low Level one – the green level, which means Covid- is no longer present in the UK The Covid alert level systems are completely separate and independent from government decisions to ease or tighten restrictions, so a rise in level doesn’t automatically mean any change in Covid rules, unless otherwise specied.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iantNHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But after the birth of their second and third children, twins, the couple, from San Diego in the US, who had been sober for some time, began drinking again and it wrecked havoc on their relationship. Brittany said: “We started drinking again, thinking we took a few years off and we could drink again like normal people do. “And it was OK for a while and then eventually, you know, things started to get bad and worse and then we ended up separating and filing for orce in . “It wasn’t just all because of alcohol. There were a lot of other very toxic behaviours. “We were very codependent on each other and it was just not a good situation.” The couple spent ,throughout the orce process, going into debt that they are still working to clear.

Youaposd open each door to find a festive picture - there was no chocolate, beer, or makeup to procure. But considering all the misery and gloom of the last two years, many of us have indulged in a treat-based advent calendar. And who doesnapost love a little chocolate each morning  Especially when youaposre young and normally have strict limits on chocolate consumption. But one chocolate firm has apologised after leaving some children in floods of tears after they discovered there was no sweet treat behind a window. Parents who had bought their kids an advent calendar from Tony Chocolonely contacted the company - who confirmed they had left out a chocolate on purpose. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The Fairtrade company left out  December as part of a bid to educate consumers about inequality in the chocolate industry. This was then followed up by two chocolates on  December - in a bid to highlight the imbalance. But it was hard for some children to understand, with one mum writing on the FB page: “My eight-year-old daughter was in floods of tears at the disappointment. She has ADHD and is awaiting a possible autism diagnosis, so what seems like small upsets to others are a big deal to her.”Another wrote on the firmaposs Facebook page: I think youaposre preaching to the wrong people here. Those that bought yourcalendar did so because they already support your cause.Causing upset to small children - who donapost actually buy their own chocolate, just to prove a point doesnapost sit well with me. A third added: My  year old was devastated there was no choc! Iaposm not sure heaposll appreciate your message eitherBut one mum commented: Totally got it straight away, I think it’s a perfect session for anyone. Great way to teach a child about fairness and equality - no giving in and opening another door in this house - the point would be lost and you learn nothing. Another added: It was a great way to highlight the situation, especially during a season when so many of us are surrounded by so much.apos In a statement, Tony’s Chocolonely said : “At Tony’s we use our products to communicate our mission – to make  percent slave free the norm in chocolate.“In Ghana and the Ivory Coast, at least . million children work under illegal conditions because the price being paid for cocoa is too low. Worst still, at least , adults and children are forced to work. We don’t think that’s okay. “So our products, including our countdown calendar, are purposefully designed to be unequally ided. Our countdown calendar includes  tiny Tony’s split over  windows. # has no tiny, # and # have two tinys to illustrate this. Following the backlash, the company said: “We have more to learn in considering how we can make our products as inclusive as possible “Unfortunately, we failed to consider the dficulties empty windows can cause for neuroergent children and adults. We have more to learn in considering how we can make our products as inclusive as possible. “We would like to welcome all feedback on how to make our products more accommodating for neuroergent people going forward as it was not our intention to cause this issue. We always want to make people smile with our products but we are not perfect and appreciate the feedback that helps us to become better as we grow.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Chocolate\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The small piano shop owner and dad of two made his own film, which shows Santa almost failing to pick up his order - and it took just five nights to create the  seconds of animation. However, his advert was just a fraction of the cost of John Lewis’ Unexpected Guest telly advert which cost an estimated £million - and fans are saying they prefer Markaposs version. What do you think about Markaposs advert  Let us know in the comments...Mark, who runs his family-run shop in Oldham, Gtr Mancs created the video at night after putting his kids Sally, ten and seven-year-old Louis to bed. He said: I would fill my bag with snacks every night at  pm and head off alone to the piano shop. Iaposd get home at around  am every night with aching bones after moving the pianos around  times each night. There is  seconds worth of animation featuring up to five pianos in each scene.  That means I was moving the pianos over , times in total. If you include the deleted out-takes it was probably over , piano moves. The video features Mark’s we and piano shop manager Julie Goodwin, , and piano cabinet repair technician Phil Reynolds,  - who plays Santa. Phil stole the role of Santa from another employee after it was discovered that he had the longest and whitest beard. In , Mark’s children starred in the £ ad where they delivered a piano to their granddad for Christmas and it racked up over , views on YouTube.  Last year, he spent £ on a Covid--themed one of the kids dropping a piano off for the grandma but she couldn’t go in the house. Mark added: So far people have loved our new video which is a huge relief as the pressure gets to me whilst making these videos. We never have a big budget and this year we spent just £ - which included a £ Santa cloak from a local charity shop along with £ of decorations. These past two years have been really dficult. We have been low on stock most of the time and have seen our container shipment costs go up , per cent compared with . But weaposve focussed on trying to make our staff feel valued and putting our customersapos needs first. And we think that has helped keep us afloat,  looks set to be equally challenging. But we are ready for anything and feel lucky to do a job that we love.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Whether theyaposre being denied their owneraposs fast food, are unhappy with the portion theyaposve been served up, or are convinced they deserve to be fed whenever they please, these dogs had some of the funniest over-the-top reactions to their dietary restrictions. A series of hilarious clips have been shared across the internet showing ious dog breeds voicing their displeasure at the lack of grub on offer. For some, a despairing look has done all the talking, as they display their best puppy dog eyes. Here are a few stories that have had people chuckling. “Where’s my scrambled egg  When Dusty was offered kibble with carrots and peas, the sassy dachshund was having none of it.Dusty quickly shoves the bowl away, while the hilarious TikTok clip from@dustydollysausagesguesses at what the fussy pup might be thinking.“Nope, get it away from me. I don’t want that brown ****,” the voiceover says. “I’ve seen what you’re having for tea and you offer me this  How dare you, it’s an insult.” In fairness to Dusty, she just recently gave birth to six puppies, so perhaps she feels deserving of something a bit fancier as a hard-working new mother. Dusty’s owner Chloe Booth says that it’s not unusual for the a dog to refuse her standard dog food in favour of scrambled eggs, boiled chicken or fish. “She thinks she’s Queen of the house,” Chloe says. Food dispenser tantrum  Olive’s owner has bought her a shiny new food dispenser - but the Dogo Argentino is convinced that the new gadget must be broken, because it won’t give her endless supplies of food on demand. Poor Olive clearly feels hard done by that the automatic dispenser has been set to a schedule that doesn’t suit her appetite, in a TikTok clip posted by@olive.and.haileythat left viewers in stitches over her melodramatic reaction.The pup barks, growls and whines at her owner, clearly arguing the case to fix the dispenser to give her food right away, as owner Hailey patiently explains that it will only feed her three times a day. But Olive won’t take no for an answer, having a full-on tantrum in front of the dastardly dispenser and wailing dramatically when Hailey says it will next give her some food at noon. “I will surely starve by noon, mother!” one TikTok user commented on the funny clip, which seems to sum up Olive’s argument exactly. Phil Collins, who   This Staffordshire Bull Terrier is hungry - and he wants the whole house to know about it. Alfie’s solution to alert everyone that it’s his dinnertime is to perform a ‘drum solo’ on the bottom of his empty bowl.In a TikTok clip that shows Alfie in “full on a mode”, the dramatic dog paws frantically at his bowl like he’s trying to dig for more food - or at least wake everyone in earshot, theDaily Star reports . “You hungry mate ” his amused owner asks in the@alfieandaryaTikTok clip, to which Alfie looks up pointedly ashe can’t believe the audacity of the question.Measly portions  Even though diets might be the best course of action sometimes, nobody enjoys being put on one - and Mango’s face says it all.The golden retriever was left fuming after being served up a measly portion of kibble, ina video posted on TikTokfrom @itsmissmango.Although she was put on a diet by her vet, that does little to appease Mango, who flashes her owner a desperate look when she realises that the small amount poured into her food bowl is all she’s getting. The short-changed pup gathered a lot of sympathy from viewers, with one person declaring: Mango - Iaposm coming to rescue you! McDonald’s obsession Of course, dogs often expect their owners to share their meals with them - and evenit’s not in their best interests to tuck into human food, it doesn’t stop them from wanting in on the action, as Gus proves in a TikTok clip by@margot_and_gus .The six-year-old Weimaraner is obsessed with McDonalds, and will do anything to get his paws on his mum’s cheeseburger. The vocal pup spends several minutes getting himself very worked up at the fact that the tempting treat isn’t being offered up to him, performing desperate spins and toe-taps around the kitchen as he cries.

What do you think about Lewisapos loss on Sunday  Let us know in the comments...In the advert for the class, Lewis said: When I was four or five years old, I either wanted to be superman or a Formula One world champion. When my visor comes down thataposs when my mind definitely switches to a dferent capacity and itaposs high octane. As an athlete, Iaposm always looking for how I can be better. Iaposm going to be talking to you about mental preparation, how you can be laser focussed and have more energy. How you can feel healthier - because the better you feel the better you are at doing your job.  You might already be successful, killing it at whatever youaposre doing, but I can help you be better. My mastery is not the ability to put the car on the limit, itaposs mastering my emotions and understanding how to live into my potential. I will show you what is possible. An advert for the classes was shared by Hamilton on Tuesday, December  - before the final race in Abu Dhabi, where it looked like he was going to win the championship. But in a controversial end to the season, he was overtaken by Red Bullaposs Max Verstappen on the last lap following an incident that brought out the safety car.

Get over it. How dya get on yesterday lad, wrote a fourth. But some fans were supportive, despite the last-minute loss on Sunday. One said: You are the World Champion in our hearts no matter what! And a second added: You are amazing, a true gent. I admire you greatly.

He said he was completely taken aback, but then realised his eyes were playing tricks on him - and what he was seeing was his own reflection mirrored back to himself. What Thomas had seen, while climbing Great End in the Lake District, was a rare optical illusion known as a brocken spectre - where a large shadow of an observer is cast onto cloud or mist. What do you think about the optical illusion  Let us know in the comments...Thomas, from Manchester, said: I was taken aback a little bit. Itaposs really beautul. It looks like a figure floating into the sky, it looks quite spiritual. It was weird, surreal and a really beautul moment - I was looking down a gully from the summit, the sun was behind me and shining bright.

It is a classic, but have you ever stopped to think and realise just how many numbers are mentioned in the catchy tune  It is wonderfully mathematical, especially when it comes to legs. Yes you read that right.Now, as weird as that sounds, University of Oxford mathematics professor, Dr Tom Crawford, explained the importance of the number of legs in the carol in an post written for the university. Tom also has a Youtube channel, Tom Rocks Maths, where he has grown his  to .K subscribers. He explained the reason for his counting of legs, saying: “To really get to grips with the maths hidden in the  Days of Christmas we really are going to count legs.”It was a question that was posed on BBC Radio ’s Today programme a few years back, which is what originally prompted Tom to demonstrate his findings and work out the numbers hidden within the Christmas song.Tom explains that the first task is to work out what each of the named gts actually are. He explains: “I can confirm thatyou are unsure of the type of animal being mentioned, it is in fact a bird.” He then proceeded to detail the first four gts, which are as follows:  Next in the song comes the iconic line that absolutely everyone loves, all together now, “FIVE GOLD RINGS”. Tom continues: “Rings of course do not have any legs and so will add zero to our total, meaning that we can basically ignore them from this point onwards. “Gt number six is another birdin the form of a goose, which adds a further  x    legs to our total.” To mark the halfway point of the song, Tom launches into a short digression into the world of economics, saying: “With what can only be classied as ‘the world’s best idea’, the US bank PNC Wealth Management calculates the exact cost of the  items mentioned in the song using current prices to create the Christmas Price Index. I kid you not.  “It may have started as a bit of fun  years ago but is now seen by many as a reasonably accurate reflection of the ‘true cost of Christmas’. “It even takes place annually between December  and January  to provide the most accurate reflection of the  gts across each of the  days.” With this rather wild fact out of the way, Tom reaches gt number seven, a swan, which gives  x    legs to add to the ongoing total. Gt number eight brings with it a slightly more complex sum, Tom explains: Eight maids milking – two legs for each maid, plus four legs for each cow goat another farm animal that was traditionally milked by maids, gives  x    legs in total.” The final four gts all contain humans, which Tom details in the diagram below.  With the counting done and dusted, Tom delves into the mathematical insight of the puzzle, he says: “We know the total number of legs in each verseand so just need to work out how many times we sing each one. “As there are  days, and on each day, we recite the previous gts that we have received, we will mention ‘day Z’ a total of  minus Z times. “For example, the partridge verse is about day , and we sing it  minus  equals  times. Turtle doves are day  and are mentioned  –    times. “French hens are day  and are mentioned  –    times etc. This pattern continues all the way up to the final verse with our  drummers being mentioned only once.” So what happens when you put this all together  Partridge:  x    Turtle doves:  x    French hens:  x    Calling birds:  x    Rings:  x    Geese:  x    Swans:  x    Maids:  x    Ladies:  x    Lords:  x    Pipers:  x    Drummers  x    TOTAL   So there you have it, the  Days of Christmas encompasses a total of  legs - that’s certainly a fact to remember and be armed with when attending your next pub quiz.

Rivets are normally found around the front and back pockets on jeans and theyaposre made by pressing or hammering a ‘washer’ or ‘disk’ onto a metal stud through the denim. The use of rivets on pockets dates back to  and their existence is all thanks to a tailor from Nevada named Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss  Co.Davis had been buying fabric from Levi Strauss to create clothing for miners and adding rivets to the pockets.He wrote a letter to Strauss explaining how the copper rivets helped to strengthen pockets when the miners were filling them with heavy tools.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Strauss and Davis went on to form a partnership and received a patent for an improvement in fastening pocket openings. Rivets continue to feature on jeans all these years later, appearing in places where the most strain is put on the fabric to prevent seams from splitting. As well as this, there are a number of other common items in your home which have curious uses and features.Take for instance, a Heinz bottle of tomato ketchup.If you look closely at a glass bottle of the red sauce, youaposll notice the number  above the label, just below the neck.  While this number is often thought to represent the ious dferent products Heinz makes, it turns out, itaposs also strategically placed for an important reason. According to the company, the spot is the perfect place to tap on the bottle when youaposre struggling to get ketchup out. In the trivia section of their website, they explained: To release Heinz Tomato Ketchup from its glass bottle with extra speed, apply a firm tap to the spot marked aposapos on the neck label. And have you ever wondered why the letters on your laptop or computer keyboard arenapost in alphabetical order  Some of the first keyboards invented for typewriters had the keys positioned in alphabetical order, but it soon became apparent that the arrangement didnapost work very well as the typebars would clash.  So the whole thing had to be re-arranged in order to make the machines work, taking into consideration the most common letter combinations and the frequency of use for each letter. The result was the QWERTY keyboard we use today, which was designed by Christopher Sholes. Going back a few years now to your school days, do you remember those double-coloured erasersyou had in your pencil case, where one end was red and the other was blue  That wasnapost just a fun design - each colour actually has a dferent use. Many believe the red is for erasing pencil marks and the blue side rubs out pen, but this wasnapost always the case. The red end is softer as itaposs actually meant for use on light paper, while the blue end is intended for coarser paper.  We also recently discovered that the sombrero on Sierra Tequila bottles has a aposgame-changingapos use.While some assumed it was merely a fun addition to the bottle, it turns out the sombrero can be used as a lime squeezer and the ideal item to measure out the right amount of tequila for a shot. But most interesting of all its purposes, is that the rim of the sombrero can also be used neatly salt your glass.People on Twitter lost their minds over the discovery after it was shared by Jack Mull.Iaposm shook, replied one person. Another said: You have changed everything. A third commented: WHATTTTT NO THIS CHANGES THE ENTIRE GAME.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Guge, an eight-year-old Belgian malinois, had been relaxing on the swing when he’d decided he’d had enough and wanted off. But as the ex-Australian military special forces dog hopped down from the playground equipment, the ‘sneaky swing’ banged into the dog - and Guge was having none of it. The dog spun around and chomped down on the edge of the swing with his extra strong titanium teeth.The special ops K gave his .k Instagram followers a good laugh at his reaction to being sneaked up on, with one writing: “That swing won’t sneak up on Guge again #lessonlearnt.” Another added: “He really took offence to it bumping into him didn’t he.” “Guge  - Swing ,” commented a third. Guge was formerly a trained attack dog, but retired in  on medical advice following a torn gracilis muscle. The pup was born in Croatia in May  before being imported to the Netherlands, and bought by the Australian Defence Force’s nd Commando Regiment.⁣ The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter.His owner, Steve, who shared Guge’s story on Instagram, said: “He began training to become a Special Ops attack-dog with his first handler. Unfortunately, Guge was injured shortly after, in Jan , rupturing his rear right ACL , and undergoing TPLO surgery with a y rehab process.⁣⁣”Guge bounced back, continuing his training and began to earn his fearsome reputation. Guge’s first handler was forced into a management role within the dog cell, which is when I came in, after ing from a deployment to Iraq.⁣” Guge and Steve became a qualied team in , working with the Tactical Assault Group - Australia’s domestic counter terrorism unit.⁣ When he wasn’t fighting crime, Guge was fathering puppies, siring a litter of  pups in . He’s even produced working dogs for the army and air force via articial insemination since.  ⁣⁣But after being forced to retire, Guge had to undertake some training to ensure he could continue living out his days with Steve as a pet, and has been ‘much loved and pampered ever since’. Belgian malinois are an intelligent and athletic breed, often used in the police force and army as working dogs for search and general purpose.TeamDogs spoke to the trainer of one malinois, called Shinga, who was beingtrained to protect rhinos in Africa.Part of Dogs  Wild, in South Wales, Shinga was getting ready for a deployment to Zimbabwe where she would be tracking humans across nature reserves, as well as act as a deterrent to poachers looking to hunt antelope, giraffes and warthogs.

The fact their data shows a reduction in speeds across the Borders is really encouraging news.\"A public consultation was also conducted, and feedback on the mph speed limits was also sought from local community councils.Using the data and feedback from the public, the report recommends that the mph limit be the \"default\" around towns and villages, with some areas retaining \"mph or mph buffer zones in place where suitable\".The buffer zones will be away from residential areas and on stretches of road \"where it is felt driving at mph is dficult to justy and particularly challenging\".Mr Edgar added: “I would like to thank everyone that contributed to the public consultation, providing really valuable local insight and opinions. The responses were ied but it was clear that many people noted the value of a mph limit especially in residential areas and near schools.“Councillors will now discuss and vote on this proposal on Thursday and I hope they can support the permanent introduction of mph, making our towns and villages safer for all for years to

near his home.In a letter sent to Innerleithen Community Council chairman Marshall Douglas, John Paterson, of The Ley, said that during the weekends and summer months the layby adjacent to his driveway and the green spaces along the B are “rammed” with vehicles which have flocked to the region.At a meeting of the community council on Monday , Mr Paterson shared his concerns and requested that action be taken to tackle the issue, described by one councillor as “hellish”.“We’ve always had issues with camping, we’ve even had some trees chopped down by people camping there, litter, people urinating and defecating either on my property or at my entrance which is pretty unpleasant as you can imagine,\" he said. “And it just seems to have reached a real pitch in recent times.“I know it’s been very bad for some while now at the likes of the Cauld and the golf club used to have a lot of problems with people parking there as well.”Mr Paterson has spoken with Police Scotland about the issue and it was suggested to put up bollards or reflector posts around the bend to discourage people from parking on the verges.Tweeddale East councillor Robin Tatlersaid he would look into solutions.He said: “I absolutely sympathise with you. I can understand that this must be absolutely hellish.“In the short term we need to do something immediately about trying to discourage people from parking in inappropriate places and I’m more than happy to take that forward to the community action teamwith the police.“I think in the medium term we need to be trying to encourage people, when there are peak times, to not park there but to park down in the town.”Also at this week’s meeting was Emma Guy from Enduro World Series , who formerly worked as project coordinator for the Tweed Valley Tourism Bid..removeShe said: “I’m well aware of this issue and some of us [from Tweed Valley Tourism Bid] did try and tackle it on the ground about a year and a half ago with putting signs up near the Cauld.“So around the event at the beginning of October we had shuttles so people wouldn’t park in these hotspots, we cordoned off areas, we spoke to the golf club and we had marshals in place to police any bad behaviour, so tat worked quite well.“Our kind of feeling is that this is an ongoing problem and it does need solutions, there needs to be some kind of visitor infrastructure investment and certainly in my role with the Tourism Bid we were pushing really hard for that.“From an EWS point of view, with regard to events, we worked quite hard to manage that problem because we know how disruptive and how unpleasant that can be.“In my role with EWS we would support and put our weight behind any proposals to the council to SOSEto try and alleviate this.”Tweeddale East councillor Shona Haslam, of the Conservatives, added: “In terms of the long term [solution] obviously we’ve got £ million coming into mountain biking infrastructure into Innerleithen and £ million for a town the size of Innerleithen is pretty signicant.“So, we’ve got the Mountain Biking Innovation Centre that is moving forward in the background, obviously there’s a lot of commercial stuff in there that we’re not allowed to talk about, and there is the bike park as well. There is going to be signicant parking and infrastructure and resources.”"},{"url":null,"title":"peebles-pupils-recognised-prize-giving-ceremony","story":"PEEBLES High recently celebrated its annual prize-giving event. Here, members of the school’s higher journalism class interview some of the winners and those involved on the day...Headteacher’s messageThis year we celebrate our amazing young people and their astounding achievements in their studies through the medium of the printed press. Is it the same as enjoying the embarrassment of your granny cheering from the front row  Or as rewarding as seeing the pride on the faces of family members as you collect your certicate on stage with a smile and a handshake  Of course not. Nothing about school le post-fire post during COVID seems as rewarding or real as it once did but, be in no doubt, the young people celebrated here today are every bit as worthy of celebration and congratulations as their predecessors and perhaps even more so given all they have had to overcome and deal with to win the prizes we celebrate in this article.Perhaps you can take heart that this year’s Peebles High School prize giving offers something more permanent than fleeting moments of adulation and applause. It offers an article than can be cherished for years to come as a reminder of how our young people triumphed against the odds. Who knows, perhaps in years to come one of this year’s prize winners will be a granny or grandpa waving this copy of the Peeblesshire in the front row shouting, “I won that same prize in – prizes really meant something in my day.” Perhaps that is a bit fancul but, as your head teacher, I want to thank each and every one of you for succeeding in tough times and bringing such pride and honour to our school. Well done.And well done too to our higher journalism class and their teacher, Ms Ness, for the hard work that brings you this celebration of our fantastic young people. I also extend a special thanks to Jacqueline Wilson, the recently retired headteacher of Kingsland Primary for being our special guest in school awarding the certicates and trophies in preparation for this most unusual of prize giving events..removeCampbell Wilson, PHS rectorSpecial guestSquadron leader Stewart Campbell“As a former Peebles High School pupil, I’m delighted to have been asked to support the school’s annual prize giving. It’s important that not only the winners of these awards are praised but all Peebles High School pupils who have had to deal with their own challenges throughout the year.“I have incredibly fond memories of my time at the school, particularly with the PE department who went above and beyond to help me start on my career path. I urge all of the pupils to enjoy their time at the school, reach out for help and support when it is needed, and never stop chasing their dreams.“Congratulations to all the award winners, your hard work and dedication has been rightly recognised. I wish you all the very best for your next challenges and hope they give you joy along the way.”A former pupil of Peebles High School, Stewart joined the RAF as a pilot after completing a bachelor of education in physical education at the University of Edinburgh.

The winner of the Maigret Cup this year is Thomas Neville. Thomas has won this award through his success studying Spanish and French at Higher level. The class was fortunate enough to interview Thomas regarding the award and asked him how he felt to have won this. He said: “I’m really impressed with myself, obviously the award for overall linguist is really prestigious, and I’m really chuffed with myself as there is obviously a lot of languages at this school so to have won the best overall award for languages is something that I’m really proud of.”By Harry NessAmy Brown: Outstanding Musical ContributionOn November  the class interviewed former Peebles High School student Amy Brown to discuss her achievement of the Outstanding Musical Contribution Award. This is presented in recognition of the huge commitment made to the extra curricular le of the school and is awarded to a pupil who have been a source of inspiration to their fellow musicians throughout their time at Peebles. She was delighted to have won, even though she only took music for enjoyment and went on to express her disappointment at not being able to perform fully last year. She graciously stated that she was glad pupils are “able to get back to that now and other people are enjoying it”. While Amy is not pursuing music further , she explained that “it’s not something I want to stop doing… It was probably one of my favourite subjects, probably the one I was most relaxed aboutthat makes sense. It was always a nice environment to be in and I think that helped me enjoy it a lot more”. Amy then admitted at the risk of sounding “cliché”, that the music department concerts were the highlight of her years at the school. At the end of the interview, she imparted some very wise advice for younger years. She said: “Have more confidence in yourself, don’t care as much about what other people think.”By Madeleine HubertChristopher O’Hare: George OB Thomson Memorial CupThis award was created by professor George Thompson, who taught in the English department at Peebles High School. He devoted large parts of his research to the study of pupils with additional needs and was always adamant that they should be integrated into the “le and work of the whole school”. The council of Tweeddale wanted to celebrate the late professor George Thompson by awarding this memorial quaich to the most creative and enterprising entry from pupils with additional needs for a project devised by the school in conjunction with the society. When the class interviewed Christopher he said he felt “brilliant and honoured” to receive this award. He told us that one teacher that improved Christopher’s school le was Mr Travis, from the technology department. Christopher described him as a “funny guy” and “nice person”, who he says is happy to help whenever. He added that design and manufacture was his favourite subject as it enabled him to unleash his creativity. Not only is Christopher creative, but funny too, and when asked what his act in a school talent show would be he replied: “I like to make people laugh and feel happy”. Finally, Christopher was asked what he wishes to do in the future. Filled with energy, he stated that he would like to join the army. The skills and qualities which Christopher has shown in order to gain this award will help him achieve his future plans. The school wishes Christopher all the best, and know he will do well in the world which anxiously awaits his talent, kindness and phenomenal humour.By Keeley RippinBen Rorison: George OB Thomson Memorial Cup, and Balfour Medal This year’s worthy prize winner of the Balfour Medal and the George OB Thomson cup is Ben Rorison. Both prizes are awarded to an inidual with a positive presence and creative outlook within their community and school le. This was an area in which Ben excelled. When asked how he felt about receiving both awards Ben stated that he was “shocked and delighted to have been picked”. Ben also mentioned that his favourite subject was music and that he wanted to pursue this by becoming a music teacher for those with additional needs. When asked what his favourite memory was at Peebles High, Ben said is was helping first year pupils and helping around the school as a prefect, just showing how deserving of this prize Ben is. The positive impact that Ben had on the school will stay with those students he helped and the teachers he worked with. The school has no doubt that Ben will continue to be a role model and inspiration to all who are fortunate enough to work with him.By Olivia ThornburrowAbbie Sorrell: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectOne winner of the Geoffrey Simpson award is ex-head girl Abbie Sorrell. The class’ first question regarded the important issue of who her favourite teacher was. She replied: “I don’t really do favourites, butI had to choose it would be Lesley Johnson. Chemistry used to be one of my weaker subjects , however I learned to love it and always looked forward to her classes”. However, she may have been won over in another way as she finishes her reply with “cake days were always a firm favourite of mine too”.Abbie was asked what her favourite memory of Peebles High School was and she responded enthusiastically “the German exchange trip”. She added: “I went as a member of the choir and loved meeting like-minded people and embracing a dferent culture. Not to mention the infamous Loch Lomond song which was always a favourite of mine.”When asked about her future plans, Abbie replied: “Wow, thinking about the future seems so daunting, however I hope that my uni degree will allow me to work in a hospital environment where I can help people. I also love the idea of travel and going on adventures to make some memories.”The class asked Abbie to reflect on and offer advice to her first year self, and she responded with “the list is long… the main thing I’d say is not to be so hard on myself and to accept that set backs are important for learning just as much as success”. Carrying on the theme of advice Abbie was asked what she would say to this year’s head team and she told them to “embrace everything because the year will be over before you know it. Therefore, just make the most of every opportunity and most of all enjoy yourself and have fun working with your peers”.By Rosie DykesEuan Macrae: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectEuan Macrae was awarded the prestigious Geoffrey Simpson Award for his efforts as head boy. Euan had to show certain skills such as leadership and teamwork in order to effectively guide the school. In an interview with Euan, who is now studying Medicine at University, he highlighted how the school fire and COVID had affected his work ethic during his final few years in school, and how this has impacted the lives of not only himself but also his year group going into exams and beyond. He explained that “we’d never sat proper higher exams which would have set us up for the bigger exams that we were going to have to sit further down the line so the damage from that is probably still lasting”. The class asked Euan who his hero was, he very honestly answered with his grandfather, saying that he had always looked up to him due to his intelligence and bravery. When asked who his favourite teacher was at school, Euan passionately discussed how Miss Dunlop, who taught history, influenced his high school experience as “she had the entire class focused on what she was saying and she never even had to raise her voice. I soon realised that learning could be actually so much fun as well as informative”.By Louise RussellRachel McManus: Tweed Reads PrizeCampbell Hunter was a much-loved member of the Peebles community. He made fantastic contributions to the Tweed Reads organisation and thrived under the leadership role. He was kind, compassionate and showed a real love of encouraging the younger generations to explore and enjoy reading. Campbell worked tirelessly alongside the other members of Tweed Reads and valued the importance of learning, community and service. Campbell was such an important part of the community, and his astounding contribution to Tweed Reads only proved how far he was set to go outside of school.The Tweed Reads prize is named after Campbell Hunter, not just to honour his memory but to honour everything he stood for and his contributions to the Tweed Reads club. The prize is awarded to the few who epitomise Campbell’s wonderful leadership qualities and share his values of learning and community. The Campbell Hunter prize for  goes to Rachel McManus who consistently worked creatively within the confines of COVID regulations and was always relentlessly positive.When the class asked Rachel about the prize itself and how she felt to have won it, she described Campbell as “a huge part of Tweed Reads in his last few years of high school and had a real passion for helping young children in the community develop their reading skills and form a love for reading”. Rachel says she feels “honoured to have won the Campbell Hunter prize through Tweed Reads” and she hopes to continue her involvement with the organisation in coming years.When asked in an interview how the fire and pandemic affected her work ethic within school she replied it had “a massive impact on students”. She then went on to congratulate the school saying it has “worked hard to ensure that pupils were still able to have a good amount of teaching with being online and there was always support available should anyone have needed it”. Rachel closed her answer by admitting that “it was hard to concentrate on work at home, so you really had to push yourself to stay motivated and keep on top of the workload”.Rachel was asked how she felt the award carried on Campbell’s legacy. She responded saying that it demonstrates all of the commitment he put into Tweed Reads and his caring nature over his home community.She added: “In my sixth year of high school I heard many stories of Campbell from Tweed Reads leaders who had worked alongside him. They always said how much commitment he had to the charity and how much he cared about truly representing the ethos of the charity so therefore I feel that the Campbell Hunter prize is a true legacy of all the hard work and dedication that he put into the charity.”By Rosie Dykes"},{"url":null,"title":"laws-implications-e-scooters","story":"POLICE in the Scottish Borders are warning anyone planning to purchase an e-scooter this Christmas to make sure they know the laws and implications beforehand.Using an e-scooter in a public place in Scotland is illegal.This includes roads, pavements, parks, town centres and promenades.

He started juggling with knives and balancing on one leg while standing on a giant ball!He was playing with our senses, he knew exactly how to build suspense and stretch our belief in what we thought was possible. You could hear the silenced hush of awe in the audience watching his performance.Awe is something we all need on a regular basis. In fact,you look at the science, it has a huge impact on our ability to think, investigate, make discoveries and inventions.It stimulates our curiosity and makes us feel more connected, for example to nature, to our community, to history or whatever small wonders we experience every day.John Muir often talked about being awestricken by the natural wonders he experienced. They often overwhelmed his senses and this fed his passion to protect the landscape he revered, resulting in the formation of the national parks in the USA.But his sense of awe enthralled him as a child, as he explored the shore and fields around his home town of Dunbar.That’s the thing our sense of awe is not confined to grand sights. There are everyday wonders we encounter, and pausing for a moment to feel that sense of being “awe-stricken” has such a huge impact on our well-being.Scientists will tell you awe will transform your mind, make you feel humble and more empathetic. It’s an uplting spiritual experience, and I don’t mean religious, although awe is an important part of all religions.But you don’t have to be religious to be spiritual. And I think being able to feel amazed by the things around us is a spiritual way of being.And at Christmas-time especially, I often feel the ironic contradiction of a celebration that has at its heart a powerful spiritual message, but which has been hijacked to promote the needs of mass consumerism.The pressure to buy at this time can hit hard, especially when paying the bills and putting food on the table is a daily concern for so many. Poverty’s cold fingers are creeping into our homes as we try to keep warm. Yet, especiallywe have children, we want our family to feel included and blessed at this time. Who doesn’t How hard it is to resist the powerful messages thrown at us that fulfilment and happiness can be bought with the latest updated stuff you buy in shops that the phone you got last year is old now, you need a new one those shoes have the wrong label, you just have to have this because everyone  does. The list could be endless.Unfortunately, you can’t buy a sense of awe in the shops. No, wait, actually it’s fortunate! If it was something you had to buy then they’d commody it, overprice it and, once you’d bought it, tell you it was now obsolete and you needed a new version!It’s going to be an especially hard Christmas for so many of us this year, for so many dferent reasons, including financial ones.I get overwhelmed by it so often, and I often feel guilt that I’m not spending enough on gts, even though in my heart I know it’s not the cost that ultimately matters but the thought. The consumerist message is so powerful and universal that it’s dficult to opt out.But this is where cultivating our sense of awe can be so uplting, at a time when we feel so much pressure.

In this, her eighth novel, Sarah Moss takes full advantage of the second lockdown to create a claustrophobic atmosphere of deepening dread and despair. Her simple plot, spanning only a few hours, is all the more powerful for being played out against a backdrop of kitchen appliances and facemasks.At the height of the restrictions, single mother Kate and her -year-old son Matt are in enforced quarantine. Neither is ill, but both are suffering. They live on the edge of the Peak District fells, and until their obligatory self-isolation, no day had passed without Kate getting outdoors to clear her head. These are hard times, but she is feeling it especially keenly: “the longer this goes on, the less she objects to dying and the harder it is to understand why other people don’t feel the same way.”Confined to house and garden, she begins to buckle. But as Moss quietly shows, her mental torment is not recent. Months earlier, she taped up their supply of paracetamol and put it in the car, out of easy reach. Her fragile state is the starting point for a novel that shows the toll the pandemic is taking on those already struggling.Matt is a thoughtful son, but he cannot guess the depths of his mother’s distress until she flouts the rules and heads out for a walk. When she has not ed by nightfall, the screw begins to tighten. As a mountain rescue team gets into gear, Moss unleashes the full force of misery and anxiety felt by Kate, her son, and their neighbour Alice, who is recovering from cancer. The novel also encompasses one of the rescue team who, for reasons that gradually become clear, prefers the company of the rainswept fells to that of his family.Recounted in a revolving series of interior monologues, as people’s thoughts unspool, The Fell is a cameo of the pandemic as well as inidual plights. As in her other novels, Moss taps into the background static of everyday affairs that interfere with everyone’s mind. Reflections on plastic, home-made paint, eco-friendly toothbrushes that don’t do the job, workers on furlough, the new regime that encourages reporting neighbours – all add to the unease and turmoil. As the story unfolds, Moss’s protagonists give a decent impression, in AL Kennedy’s words, of attempting to survive our time. Except it seems Kate might not survive, nor even want to.Moss steps into other people’s shoes with impressive ease. Her prose is clear, low-key and compelling, its power incremental. And, although there is little to distinguish between the way her characters think, none is a cliche. Kate is complex and frayed Matt is not a stereotypical teenager, but nor is he weird. Alice knows that, despite the cancer, she is fortunate. After it was suggested she keep a gratitude journal, she thought: “grateful to whom, exactly, and for what, that my very ordinary virtues have been disproportionately rewarded in this world while worse things happen to better people ”The presence of the Fell looms over them all, its breath chilling the plot. Yet without it, Kate would not cope. When she breaks for the hills, she thinks: “It’s like walking on water … like walking over ocean swell, and the wind ruffling the heather and the bog cotton the way it ruffles the sea, and like the sea the dangers are at the edges, where water and rock drop to the valleys.”The Fell is about the hazards that lurk at the edges of le. Feelingly, but without sentimentality, Moss explores what happens when you suddenly find yourself teetering on the precipice."},{"url":null,"title":"galleries-much-see-first-exhibition-impressive-new-arts-space","story":"Galleries: So much to see at first exhibition at impressive new arts spaceSolace, Edinburgh PrintmakersGalleries: So much to see at first exhibition at impressive new arts spaceWillie Sutherland with one of his spaceman sculptures in front of George Wyllieltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgts Original Earth Gultspan classtruncate-full-screengtarantee, part of his manesto for Day Down a GoldmineAnd why not, for there are fine works here, from examples of Anupa Gardner’s evocative and detailed woodcuts, “Night Descends” and “Lonely George”, to Alistair Clark’s An Island in Time series of archival prints digital collages, both produced in . Indeed the title, Solace, refers to the solace artists found in art during the last two years of troubled times. Solace, too, to view it, you might say, and to wonder at the ersity of effects and visions that such intricate and labour-intensive processes produce.For it is a very dferent process to work in print as opposed to paint, as one technician tells me as we look through examples of screenprints that she and others have historically worked on. Most dficult, she tells me, is when an artist provides a painting which they simply want to turn straight in to a print. It does not quite work like this, with a process like screenprinting, where every work has to be reduced down to its constituent layers – or what the printmaker must determine, with their own skill, are its layers. If one is experienced in printmaking, or is an artist who sets out specically thinking of producing a print image, then the layers are part of the conception.Each colour must be considered, and a ‘master’ of that produced, so that once the fascinating process of printing the images out is complete, the layers elide and collide in harmony to produce an image that is more than the sum of its parts.Some can create complex images with only a few colour layers – one thinks of printmaker and artist Angie Lewin, for example, who has worked with the printmakers here – whilst others may use  or more layers. The work can take months.Etching has its own allure, a process of acid wash and resist, an incising of line, a passing through a heavy printing press, the artists turning the wheel, assome ancient industrial process. Then the woodcutters and linocutters, the detail of incision, and the constant scrubbing and cleaning which ensures that equipment and printed images are kept in order throughout. This is the work of the space upstairs. Downstairs, the two level gallery spaces now house the results.There are a iety of media here from the  members who have submitted work, from work printed on paper, to work on ceramics or silk. The lockdowns of the last two years were extremely dficult for artists working in machinery-heavy studio processes, such as printmaking, and so artists were forced to work around their subject or in dferent media, ing to printmaking only during those brief periods of masked-up respite that we experience inbetween times.There are shared subjects here too, a preponderance of views from outdoors – those daily walks, wherever they were, however they were taken – or domestic interiors, with which we all became so familiar. There are flights of fancy too, and evocative escapisms, such as Patricia Willder’s “Sky, Stars and Sea” , Sarah Young’s “Rannoch Road”or evocations of the natural world, such as Nicky Sanderson’s gannetry monoprint, “Sula Bassana” . It all rubs along well together, a celebration of what was briefly lost, hopefully, and in some cases flamboyantly, regained.Solace, Edinburgh Printmakers, Castle Mill,  Dundee Street, Edinburgh,    www.edinburghprintmakers Until  Dec, Tues - Sun, am - pmCritics ChoiceThis is an exhibition that celebrates Glasgow and Wyllie’s innovative and witty creations, from Sutherland’s own toy-like sculptural figures to Sharmanka Kinetic Theatre’s “show-stealing” exhibit, “The Le of Artists” with a tiny model of Wyllie himself in the centre of it.Sutherland, who only came to art late in le, having had, like many, to put it aside for the basic task of making a living, gave himself a goal at the beginning of January  to exhibit by July, working on what came to be his tiny paper sculptures, “to please the boy I once was”. Exhibiting at Glasgow International, he somewhat achieved his aim. His inspiration was Wyllie, another who came to art late in le, and in this vein, he launched a collaboration with Wyllie’s family, out of which this exhibition was born. The exhibition is reimagined in its entirety, with works on display from Wylie’s family, works by Sutherland and works inspired by originals from artists including Laura McGlinchey, Judith Kenny, Daria Zapula, Karen Suzuki, Eduard Bersudsky, and Hugh Clark. Alongside, an exhibition of Sutherland’s sculptures, including work in collaboration with the psychiatric unit in Leverndale Hospital.Christmas Day Down a Goldmine, French Street Studios,  -  French Street, Glasgow www.williewawa christmas-day-down-a-goldmine Until  Dec, am - pm Daily Dont MissMUCH to see at the Pier Arts Centre in Stromness these last couple of weeks before Christmas, including a large selection of works for sale in the annual Open Exhibition, from drawings to prints and cushions.

Early indications are that Omicron infections generally aren’t as severe as others, but it is much more contagious. So it’s likely that a greater number of people will be infected and, evensevere illness rates are lower, the overall number of hospitalisations will be higher.Ms Stephenson rejects that, but what qualications does she have to persuade me to accept her views over those of the UK’s health experts  She hasn’t even listened to interviews with experts in the field. She says that % of the adult UK population have antibodies, so we don’t need to worry. As I understand it, the problem with Omicron is that it evades the antibodies, and it’s other aspects of the body’s response, including T-cells, that limit its severity.But what do I know  I flew aeroplanes for  years, and what I know about infectious diseases could be written on a postage stamp. What I do know is that we live in a complex world where we’re obliged to trust specialists in every detail of our lives.I remember once having passengers complaining about not landing at our intended destination, Kolkata, and ending up in Mumbai for the night. Kolkata was foggy and it was unlikely that we’d be able to land and,we’d attempted to land and failed, we’d have had insufficient fuel to reach another runway. Better the inconvenience of getting to your destination a day late than the alternative, surely.I understand why people are disappointed by restrictions, but it’s foolish to reject expert advice and rely instead on a wing and a prayer. As Neil Mackay pointed out , it’s those who won’t accept their responsibilities to their fellow citizens who are perpetuating this crisis, not the experts who give their best advice.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.WHERE IS THE ANTI-VAXXERS LOGIC MORE power to Neil Mackay. I did not agree with everything he said, for instance about sub-literates. The anti-vax lot includes a good proportion of the well-educated. Many of the Covid patients currently straining the capacity of German hospitals are of the bourgeoisie. An articulate but a bittie daft minority readily leaps to this barricade. I find that a puzzle.Meanwhile, as I have seen myself visiting a close relative, this has left our own NHS reeling. Nurses exhausted and detached, working -hour shts and staying on unpaid to get things done. And that nice Mrs Patel hunting all those foreign workers back home hasnt helped, but they will not want for employment where, so others will get the good of them.As a medic relative explained, Covid is not a nice way to go. I lost a valued acquaintance to it before any vaccine was available, and there have been several close shaves with others who have been smitted, but the hinner end fended off by vaccine. Oh, learn to live with it, they say. Well, consider the lives cut short by smallpox, crippled by polio, or the scourge of TB that went through Scotlands country areas like a kne. All left a trail of heartbreak and wreckage. Would the anti-vaxxers like that back  I cannot suppose so. But where is their logic and sense of social responsibility Gavin Sprott, Edinburgh.* OH to be a fly on the wall in a room with just Neil Mackay and Joanne Blythman present.Sue Wade, Ayr.HOSPITALITY MUST BITE THE BULLETPERMIT me to respond to William Gold’s objectionsto a vaccination passport system for entry into bars, restaurants, cafes and the like. I fear he has missed the point, that point being thatthat the incidence of Covid increases at the predicted rate then all the objections to a passport system will be moot we will be back to an indeterminate enforced lockdown and the Hielan Jessie Bar and every other bar and restaurant will be closed, many permanently.Mr Gold lists objections, citing the Licensing Scotland Act . Objections and reasons to do nothing are always easier than concrete action. The Scottish Government introduces new rules and regulations regarding Covid at a couple of days notice surely the hospitality industry has the resources to prevail upon the Government to introduce practical measures to check a vaccination passport  Furthermore, every pub that I have ever been incarries a notice stating that proof of identity may be required to very a legal drinking age. Consequently I assume that every pub employs at least one SIA-qualied person. No-one is suggesting that the passport is checked immediately upon entry, although that would be preferable. In Paris a waiter or barperson would always ask before taking an order, sometimes at the door, sometimes at your table. The point being that there would be no service without proof of vaccination.Look at what countries on the Continent are doing now: France – compulsory presentation of vaccination passport for all bars, cafes and restaurants. Ireland, ditto Germany, ditto Italy, ditto from January  Netherlands, bars, restaurants and the like closed from pm need I go on I sympathise with Mr Gold, the hospitality industry has taken a beating, but I sympathise more with those who have lost loved ones and those who are still suffering the after-effects of this dreadful disease. And, no, I am not conflating the objections of the hospitality sector with those selfish few who refuse to be vaccinated. Buta small section of society refuse to play by the social norms and duties then unfortunately the rest of us have to accept some measure of minor inconvenience, and that includes the hospitality industry.Robert Buntin, Skelmorlie.WE NEED TO LIVE WITH THISI AM no Covid denier, no vax denier, I’ve had my two jags and booster. Covid  is a bad virus, impacted the lives of millions and killed millions. The world economy apparently has been devastated, the poor once again suffering the most. The richest somehow have increased their wealth in these times.I am at a complete loss to understand how we are dealing with this new Omicron iant. I have never heard so many so-called experts using words and phrases like \"we don’t know\", \"may\", \"might\", \"could be\" and so on. Then we get who I think are the silenced experts, who say Omicron is actually not as bad, yes seems to spread quicker, but at the time of writing no deaths and no increase in hospitalisations connected to this iant.There is a creeping suggestion of new measures, stopping things, changing how we live and impacting on Christmas, families and business.Stop. We need to live with this. It is bad, worse than the flu. Is it worse than cancer, heart disease and the like  A loved one dying of Covid is no worse than a loved one dying from a preventable disease.Let’s get this into perspective and start living again.Paul McPherson, Newtonmore.PUT THIRD JAG ON THE RECORDTHE Scottish Government is quite rightly encouraging all iniduals to get their third booster vaccination as soon as they are entitled to it. I downloaded a copy of my vaccination letters from the NHS website at the start of September, having had my first and second doses, and the letter states: “This is your NHS Scotland record of vaccination. Keep it safe.”I attended for my booster jag two weeks ago and after receiving it I inquired how long it would be before I could download an updated copy of my vaccination status. I was astonished to be told that records in the public domain would not be updated with booster details.Currently when I access my vaccination details on the NHS Inform website, it confirms under “appointments” that I’ve had my third booster vaccination, but this is not reflected in my online vaccination “record”. As such, it is not an accurate record of my vaccinations. If getting the third dose is so important then it is surely important enough to be incorporated in our vaccination record. I have written to the Scottish Government on this matter and await a response.Brian Watt, Edinburgh.* IN the last few days the BMA has declared that being asthmatic is not an exemption to wearing masks. The websites of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation make similar statements. They even claim that masks do not reduce your oxygen supply or increase CO levels.My own late mother used an inhaler and got very breathless and I cant imagine her wearing a mask. In my view this decision is nothing to do with our medical well-being.Geoff Moore, Alness."},{"url":null,"title":"new-city-bus-tour-shows-glasgow-music-miles-better","story":"Now, in recognition of Glasgow connection to music down through the years, a new city open top tour bus is set to add a musical journey to its sightseeing offerings, with the perfect Glaswegian lined up to narrate the city’s musical heritage.City Sightseeing Glasgow’s music tour, which will be available on channel eight of the on-bus commentary system from January  of next year, will showcase Glasgow’s vast musical history, while promoting some of the city’s most iconic music venues at the same time, including King Tut’s, Barrowlands, The Royal Concert Hall, SWG and the Ovo Hydro to name a few.The music tour will be narrated by the renowned multi-award-winning singer songwriter, Eddi Reader.Famed for her chart topping single Perfect with band Fairground Attraction, Ms Readers recognisable voice is rooted in the heart of British music with a number of musical genres under her bow including, pop, folk music and her musical interpretation of the work of Scottish poet, Robert Burns.Written on behalf of City Sightseeing Glasgow by Glasgow Music City Tours co-founder Fiona Shepherd, the tour will reveal Glasgow’s close relationship with music throughout history with a range of interesting stories, facts, and some insider knowledge from Ms Reader herself on what exactly makes Glasgow such a wonderful, vibrant and musical city.Ms Reader said: “I adore my town - it gave me music and romantic dreams that set me on a path to the future.\"I’m honoured to be given the opportunity to tell people all about the creative spirit of Glasgow, how it seeps out of every sandstone corner and shines out of every Glaswegian.\"From the song schools of centuries ago, to the musical geniuses that inspired the world.\"Follow me along the road while I show you the musical beauty of my town past, present and future.”That past includes the formation of bands such as Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchills Simple Minds, as well as the discovery of Oasis, famously signed to a label after a gig at Glasgows King Tuts in .

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-.

Aware of the potential economic and social impact that further pandemic restrictions might have, she said that a lot would depend onfinancial aid could be agreed with the UK treasury.In the wake of this announcement and in the anticipation of further developments in the coming days, both Orkney Islands Counciland NHS Orkney have said they are prepared to respond to any new or righter restrictions which may be announced.Asked to respond to the First Minister#s announcement, an OIC spokeswoman said:  #The council is continually assessing its response to the pandemic and holds fortnightly incident management team meetings.#It was highlighted in this morning#s meeting that more announcements were likely to be coming from the First Minister.#Now that these announcements have been made this afternoon, they will be considered by officers, including our Safety  Resilience team and where necessary urgent matters will be escalated to the Incident Management Team or Senior Management Team as required, to ensure that that the council continues to support the response to the pandemic quickly and effectively.#The situation is of course fast moving and members of the public should expect further updates in due course —  but meantime we urge all to take very regular lateral flow device tests and to follow the guidance in respect to hand hygiene, face coverings and social distancing.#In a joint statement, NHS Orkney#s chief executive Michael Dickson and director of public health Louise Wilson explained that the guidance around parties has already been in force within their staff since November.They said: #The rapidly changing national picture is to be expected as we begin to understand the Omicron iant.#The guidance issued last night by Public Health Scotland regarding deferring Christmas parties was already in place here at NHS Orkney, we asked all our staff to show caution around Christmas events and to consider alternatives to reduce risk in early November.#Additionally, we have reminded all staff to work from home wherever possible and of course we are all continuing with our regular lateral flow tests and have all mitigations in place.#As the First Minister stated “our best form of defence is vaccinations”, we’d encourage anyone who is yet to be vaccinated to get in touch with ourselves, you can do this by calling   . We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

As such, it is urging people to defer such parties at this time.In a statement issued this evening, Dr Nick Phin, Public Health Scotland#s director of public health science and medical director, said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new COVID iant is much more transmissible.#The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties.“We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now. To help minimise the further spread of COVID-, and Omicron in particular, I would strongly urge people to defer their Christmas parties to another time.“I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones.”Public Health Scotland has also issued a reminder of the other measures we can all take to continue to keep safe over the festive period:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Wales’ First Minister has announced urgent plans to offer the booster vaccine to all eligible adults by the end of the year during a televised address.Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government is accelerating the booster programme as new evidence has emerged showing two doses of the Covid- vaccine are not enough to offer protection against the new Omicron iant.Omicron is expected to have become the dominant form of the virus in Wales by the end of December, Mr Drakeford confirmed.He said this would bring “a new wave of infections and illness”.There are currently  confirmed cases of Omicron in the country.In a message, broadcast to the nation on BBC Wales at .pm, and on social media at pm, he said: “We must be prepared for Omicron cases to rise quickly and very steeply – just as they have in other parts of the UK.“We are still learning about this new form of coronavirus. All the information we have tells us we are facing a very serious situation.“By the end of the month, Omicron will have become the dominant form of the virus in Wales, bringing a new wave of infections and illness.“This could then translate into a large number of people needing hospital treatment just at a time when the NHS is already under signicant pressure.”He added: “We have already taken some steps to increase protections in Wales and we may need to take some further steps to keep Wales safe.”Mr Drakeford said the aim was to offer all adults a booster by the end of the year.Mr Drakeford’s statement comes a day after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced booster jabs would be rolled out to all eligible adults in England.Long queues could be seen forming outside vaccination centres in England on Monday morning, with people reporting waiting in line as long as five hours to get their dose.Scotland has also committed to delivering booster jabs to everyone over  by the end of the year.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639060616576.jpg--covid_19___thu_9th_december_figures.jpg?1639060617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211209newscovid 19 thu 9th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

I would expect any new Assembly to place redesigning our education system at the heart of the next mandate. Until then, I call on the current Education Minister to do everything in her power to support fully the staff in every school and educational facility.The Department said it “monitors absence levels in the education sector closely to seek to ensure that absence levels are kept as low as possible and managed effectively. DE officials have been working with employing authorities to develop and implement a Managing Attendance Strategy for the Education Sector”.“This commits employers to seek improved attendance levels across the Education Sector through the proactive management of health and wellbeing and provision of support for those who are ill. Effective management of absence will also be implemented using agreed sickness absence procedures and the development of systems and information.”The news comes after Education Minister Michelle McIlveen was urged in October to advise schools on the steps they need to take when schools cannot be staffed properly due to Covid.Some schools are having to send pupils home because there are no teachers available to teach them, the Northern Ireland Teachers’ Councilsaid.Secretary of the NITC and NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland, Justin McCamphill, said there was growing concern that high levels of Covid cases and better better pay and conditions offered where are contributing to staff shortages.“NITC is alarmed that the levels of Covid in schools have contributed signicantly to schools being unable to source enough substitute teachers,” he said.“This is not the only contributing factor, many newly qualied teachers have sought work outside of Northern Ireland, where there is better pay and conditions of employment.”Related topicsMichelle McIlveenAndy AllenDepartment of EducationMore On Michelle McIlveenFlexible school starting age in Northern Ireland could be available from next yearNo surprise at rise in infected pupils, says expert amid concern over holding of transfer testsDisaster warning: Teaching union calls for December school ‘circuit breaker’ after , off with CovidDepartment reiterates its commitment to relationships and sex education review PremiumStormont ministers attend events despite their work from home messageMost ReadHow, when and where to get your Covid- booster jab in Northern Ireland this weekFormer journalist Martina Purdy given second chance to become a nunCountry music singers Aidan Taaffe and ‘Cowboy’ Larry Taaffe, along with third brother Michael Taaffe, all accused of raping same womanNorthern Ireland health service ‘pulling out all the stops’ to match England’s goal to provide Covid booster for all over s amid Omicron ‘tidal wave’Northern Ireland dentist Lee Windrum avoids prison over sex attacksTop VideosPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayBoris Johnson sets accelerated new year booster target in face of Omicron ‘tidal wave’Play#I certainly broke no rules# - Boris JohnsonLatest Northern IrelandMedical students may be used to help NI booster driveWorking from home– how to avoid burnout as Omicron cases rise in Northern IrelandDUP threat to walk away from Stormont ‘reckless’ – O’NeillFirmus energy customers in Greater Belfast face % gas price increaseBid for early trial in Van Morrison defamation case over comments about Robin SwannLatestLove Island star Demi Jones announces she is free of cancerHauliers’ protest causes rush-hour disruption in DublinElon Musk named Time magazine’s Person of the YearFrench minister: We still want a ‘few dozen’ more fishing licencesSchools should not shut early for Christmas unless told it is necessary: No ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Minister Robin Swann opened a debate on the regulations By Rebecca Black, PADecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland Assembly members are ided over a mandatory Covid certication scheme.The scheme requiring people to prove Covid status to gain entry to a range of hospitality venues and large-attendance events was introduced late last month with a two-week grace period to allow businesses to adjust to the new requirements.Patrons wishing to access nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises will need to provide proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test result or evidence of a previous Covid- infection.The same rules will apply for entry to large indoor and outdoor events, such as concerts and sporting events.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news

Minister Robin Swann The DUP opposed the scheme at the Executive and are expected to vote against it in the Assembly on Monday evening.Health Minister Robin Swann opened the debate on the regulations,

were in January  due to the Omicron iant.He said while by midday on Monday there were  confirmed cases of Omicron in Northern Ireland, as “the virus takes a hold on these islands that the number of local cases will increase rapidly”.“We must consider every possible tool we have to slow the spread and therefore to push the anticipated hospital pressures as far into the new year as possible,” he

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueA scanned digital Covid certicate Addressing concerns on why the debate had not happened earlier, Mr Swann said the regulations had to be reviewed by the Examiner of Statutory Rules for legislative competence.He told MLAs there is “clear evidence” that Covid certication will have benefits in battling the spread of Covid-, and it will reduce virus transmission, primarily by reducing the likelihood of infectious iniduals entering high-risk settings, reduce the risk of serious illness and death and alleviate pressure on the health system.Mr Swann said Covid certication will also increase the likelihood that higher risk settings will continue to be able to operate as an alternative to closure or more restrictive measures.“There is also overwhelming evidence, including that produced by the UK’s Vaccine Effectiveness Expert Panel in September of this year, that vaccination reduces the risk of becoming infected with the virus and in particular that it reduces the risk of serious illness requiring hospitalisation,” he told MLAsStormont Health Committee chairman Colm Gildernew said the committee was briefed on the Covid certication scheme, and raised the issue of compliance, adding that further work needs to be done to ensure the new rules are “achieving the desired effect”.However he said the committee agreed to recommend that the regulations be approved by the Assembly.Speaking as a Sinn Fein MLA, he said his party would back the scheme, adding that an “unprecedented public health emergency requires unprecedented actions and measures to protect our people and our health services”.However DUP MLA Pam Cameron said her party will not back the Covid certication scheme.She said she was disappointed by the decision of Mr Swann to “ignore the lack of crossbench support for this policy prior to its becoming active”.“And that the Health Minister chose to ignore that lack of crossbench unity instead deciding to plough ahead with this particular piece of legislation,” she told MLAs.“Such affirmative votes were held in Scotland and Wales so I ask why was the minister so reluctant to allow this House its place in terms of its policy.”Ms Cameron emphasised that her opposition to Covid certication should not be construed as an “unwillingness to recognise the fight against this Covid- pandemic”.“Instead, my opposition to this is largely based on the lack of evidence that this is effective, the signicant negative impact it is having on sections of our economy with no evidence of it being effective and indeed how this has been handled causing confusion and mixed messaging,” she said.Most ReadHow, when and where to get your Covid- booster jab in Northern Ireland this

What is being asked of it now in terms of booster delivery is beyond anything asked of our health service in its entire history.That reflects the emergency situation we are facing with the expected surge in COVID- cases in January as a result of the Omicron iant.“Faced with this emergency, the booster programme’s timetable has now been decisively shortened and intensive work will be required to further ramp up capacity. I am very pleased to see people coming forward in large numbers for their boosters. I would appeal for patience in the event of any queues. Please be assured that vaccinator teams are working flat out and initiatives are being finalised to help speed up provision.“Unfortunately, there have been some reports about abusive behaviour towards staff at vaccination centres. This is totally unacceptable and must stop.”Immediate initiatives to improve capacity include the recruitment of additional vaccinators, extended opening times for Trust hubs, and a programme of walk-in clinics to complement the hubs.Potential additional locations for Trust hubs are also being identied. The deferral of some planned routine health service activity is also under consideration in order to free up further capacity.Discussions are also ongoing with GPs and community pharmacists on a co-ordinated drive to extend the reach of the booster programme to everyone aged  and over.For latest details of current Trust vaccination hubs in your area, check Trust websites.A list of pharmacies offering the booster jab is available on the Health and Social Care Board website: http:www.hscboard.hscni.net booster-covid-vaccination Related topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannMore On Department of HealthNew Lodge people denied easy access to walk-in testing: SFBooster jab travel certicate and app update expectedHealth chiefs won’t say how Omicron cases arrived in Northern IrelandMedics carry out lesaving surgeries on  patients after NI stroke services expanded to seven days a week PremiumConcern as children under five referred to mental health service in NIMost ReadHow, when and where to get your Covid- booster jab in Northern Ireland this weekFormer journalist Martina Purdy given second chance to become a nunCountry music singers Aidan Taaffe and ‘Cowboy’ Larry Taaffe, along with third brother Michael Taaffe, all accused of raping same womanNorthern Ireland dentist Lee Windrum avoids prison over sex attacksNorthern Ireland health service ‘pulling out all the stops’ to match England’s goal to provide Covid booster for all over s amid Omicron ‘tidal wave’Top VideosPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayBoris Johnson sets accelerated new year booster target in face of Omicron ‘tidal wave’Play#I certainly broke no rules# - Boris JohnsonLatest Northern IrelandMedical students may be used to help NI booster driveWorking from home– how to avoid burnout as Omicron cases rise in Northern IrelandMore than , teaching days lost due to sickness in NIDUP threat to walk away from Stormont ‘reckless’ – O’NeillFirmus energy customers in Greater Belfast face % gas price increaseLatestLove Island star Demi Jones announces she is free of cancerHauliers’ protest causes rush-hour disruption in DublinElon Musk named Time magazine’s Person of the YearFrench minister: We still want a ‘few dozen’ more fishing licencesSchools should not shut early for Christmas unless told it is necessary: No ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it. The whole experience really boosted my confidence. “I really want to say a big thank you to The Beauty Edit makeup shop inFoyleside, my personal trainer, Peter Ward, and my friends and family who supported me especially my Mammy, Shauna and my best friend, Erin who travelled to Limerick with me. “Over the next year, in preparation for Miss Bikini  , I will be taking up any opportunities I can to grow my confidence and to grow as a person and grow my . I will be training so I can be the best candidate possible next year. “This year, I did the show for the experience and fun but it’s made me realise how much I want the title now and I don’t plan on letting anything distract me from it in the next year.” To support Niamh’sjourney for the next year, follow her on Instagram at:niamh.hawes  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead. Given the fact that only half of families agree to donatethey dont know their loved ones decision, but  out of  will support itthey know their loved one wanted to donate, Id ask everyone to please share their choice. By doing so you could save lives.

Mayor of Derry, Alderman Grahame Warke and Bishops Donal McKeown and Brian Forster feature in the emotional film produced as a tribute to the pandemic. The film tells the story of the restrictions placed on families and friends, who never really got an opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones.  The film featues very sensitive and emotional tribute paid to a loved one who passed away by the recital of the poem Goodbye by Thornhill pupil, Tieghan Doherty, at the end of the film.  Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish. We can be Irish by birth, Irish by ancestry, Irish by geography, Irish and British, Irish by accident, Northern Irish, Irish by necessity, Irish and European, Irish by association, Irish by culture, Irish and American and Irish by choice. “The collection is a tribute to the honesty of the contributors, and I would like to record how much I appreciate their commitment. “It started as a passion project for me, a topic I was genuinely curious. “Themore I spoke with the dferent contributors and read their stories, the more I was convinced of the books signicance as a snapshot of Irish identity today. It was a real privilege to work on it, and a welcome distraction during lockdown.” She concluded: “Becoming a parent has made me think about what this book will look like for my own two children in  years time, and that was a big motivator for me.” The contributors were encouraged to be as open and honest as possible with the intention of the book being completely inclusive and non-judgmental. All were asked the same questions: What does Irish identity mean to you personally  Why do  million people worldwide embrace their Irish heritage  Are we navel-gazing  Or are there real changes in attitude taking place in Ireland and among the Irish worldwide  Published by Lfey Press,Being Irish:  views on Irish Identity, is availablefrom local independent bookshop Little Acorn Book Store on Foyle Street as well as all major bookstores and online.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The SDLP published their energy costs action plan last week and Mr Durkan called for a payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. The payment would help families top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks so that they would be able to heat their homes over the winter without worrying about how to pay for it. Mr Durkan said: “Given the steep rise in energy bills over the last few months there are families across the North struggling to heat their homes this winter. “In the absence of any action from the Joint First Ministers or Minister Hargey to mitigate the situation the SDLP has produced a number of proposals in our energy costs action plan to try and help people through this very dficult period. “While energy bills are increasing by hundreds of pounds a year, Universal Credit claimants, who are already struggling to get by, have seen their payments cruelly cut by pound a week by the Tory government and waved through by Sinn Feacutein. “These people were barely able to cover their bills before the recent price hikes and I cannot see how they will able to meet these massive costs. “In an attempt to help the people who really need it I’m calling for the winter fuel payment, a modest payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. “This money will allow families to top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks to get them through this winter, then we can focus on tackling the long-term issues around fuel poverty. “I’m also calling on the Department for Communities to work with the Department for Health to explore how families with children with disabilities can be supported to cope with rising energy costs. “It’s disgraceful that we are already in the grip of winter and no plan has been forthcoming to help low income families deal with these mounting issues. “I will continue lobbying Minister Hargey and doing all I can to secure immediate support for the people who need it most.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Mayor was promoting a shop local drive for ChristmasReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Mayor Graham Warke has urged Derrys festive shoppers to shop local this Christmas during his whistle-stop tour of businesses and shops throughout the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week the Mayor visited a number of retail outlets and shops to find out how local traders are finding the Christmas shopping season. As part of his tour, the Mayor visited businesses in the heart of the city centre, including the Craft Village and in the Waterside. He also visited businesses in the outskirts of town at Maydown and in Eglinton and later in the week spent time with traders in Strabane. This past  months have been an extremely challenging time for local businesses, and Derry City  Strabane District Council is keen to inspire confidence among the public by encouraging them to shop local. The Council has been working closely with the business community throughout the pandemic, delivering a range of support from bespoke advice to essential grant aid. Mayor Warke said: “Local businesses have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. “Now during the busiest shopping period of the year, it’s vitally important that we support these local traders as much as possible. “These independently owned businesses are what makes our City and District unique and I was delighted to see the products and wares they have on offer, particularly for Christmas gts. I would encourage the public, as much as possible, to spend local this year.” Business Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Tara Nicholas, reiterated the Mayor’s comments adding: “Mayor Warke has heard first-hand from traders about the dficulties they have been facing throughout the pandemic. “They have also shared with the us the sense of ‘community spirit and support’ they have been receiving from their customers. “We have a great opportunity to help our home-grown, independent businesses here flourish. “Deciding to shop local really makes a huge dference to our local traders and we shouldn’t underestimate how impactful even our small spends can be. “Our independent stores and shops employ so many local staff and by supporting them, we are making a great choice in terms of supporting ourselves.” Find out more about the campaign at:shoplocalderrystrabane   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Mayor was promoting a shop local drive for ChristmasReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Mayor Graham Warke has urged Derrys festive shoppers to shop local this Christmas during his whistle-stop tour of businesses and shops throughout the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week the Mayor visited a number of retail outlets and shops to find out how local traders are finding the Christmas shopping season. As part of his tour, the Mayor visited businesses in the heart of the city centre, including the Craft Village and in the Waterside. He also visited businesses in the outskirts of town at Maydown and in Eglinton and later in the week spent time with traders in Strabane. This past  months have been an extremely challenging time for local businesses, and Derry City  Strabane District Council is keen to inspire confidence among the public by encouraging them to shop local. The Council has been working closely with the business community throughout the pandemic, delivering a range of support from bespoke advice to essential grant aid. Mayor Warke said: “Local businesses have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. “Now during the busiest shopping period of the year, it’s vitally important that we support these local traders as much as possible. “These independently owned businesses are what makes our City and District unique and I was delighted to see the products and wares they have on offer, particularly for Christmas gts. I would encourage the public, as much as possible, to spend local this year.” Business Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Tara Nicholas, reiterated the Mayor’s comments adding: “Mayor Warke has heard first-hand from traders about the dficulties they have been facing throughout the pandemic. “They have also shared with the us the sense of ‘community spirit and support’ they have been receiving from their customers. “We have a great opportunity to help our home-grown, independent businesses here flourish. “Deciding to shop local really makes a huge dference to our local traders and we shouldn’t underestimate how impactful even our small spends can be. “Our independent stores and shops employ so many local staff and by supporting them, we are making a great choice in terms of supporting ourselves.” Find out more about the campaign at:shoplocalderrystrabane   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cllr Harkin said the city of Derry should be proud of the workers for standing firm and stated that industrial action could easily have been avoided by the two employers. And Cllr Harkin expressed his hopes that both employers can learn from this dispute and move on and not to victimise employees who are UNITE trade union members for the action they were forced to take. He said: “We commend Derry dockers for staying strong and winning their demands following strike action. They should be proud of what they achieved. Everyone in the city should be proud of the dockers victory. “By staying united and braving freezing weather on the picket line, UNITE members at Burke Shipping Services and Foyle Port made gains on pay parity and a wage increase. “This was a strike that should never have been necessary. The demands made by workers were very modest but employer intransigence gave them no option but to take action. “The attempt to portray workers negatively by employers raises serious questions about public accountability when Council support is sought to become a Free Port. “It also raises questions about Derry City and Strabane Councillors having paid positions as part of the Foyle Port Commission. “People Before Profit activists were on the picket line everyday of the strike and we successfully put forward a motion winning the Council to take a clear-cut position in support of the strike and trade union demands. “We will be demanding the Council make clear there should be no victimisation of workers and the trade union following the end of the dispute. “Dockers and other workers have been told throughout the pandemic that they play a critical role as key, frontline and essential workers. “Trade unions are now demanding this is translated into improved wages and conditions for workers across all sectors. “That employers and the Stormont Executive arent automatically backing these demands points up the problem of an economy catering to elites where the gap between the least well-off and those at the top has skyrocketed. “Workers across Derry, across the North and across Ireland should take confidence and example from the resilience of Foyle Port dockers. “This is what will need to happenwe are to ensure health workers, Council workers, Education support workers and all others begin to be treated with dignity, respect and more economic equality. “No one should be told they should wait for better days - this is the time to use solidarity and action to challenge poverty pay.” UNITE General Secretary, Sharon Graham, added: “This is a tremendous win for our members. “Having endured freezing cold and driving rain on long days on picket lines, the workers stood ready to escalate their strike action but their determination led to both employers making offers which met their demands in full. “This is a good news story for workers everywhere in Northern Ireland and shows that there is a power in our union. “It confirms yet again that when our members fight in unity for their jobs, pay and conditions they can win.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The demands made by workers were very modest but employer intransigence gave them no option but to take action. “The attempt to portray workers negatively by employers raises serious questions about public accountability when Council support is sought to become a Free Port. “It also raises questions about Derry City and Strabane Councillors having paid positions as part of the Foyle Port Commission. “People Before Profit activists were on the picket line everyday of the strike and we successfully put forward a motion winning the Council to take a clear-cut position in support of the strike and trade union demands. “We will be demanding the Council make clear there should be no victimisation of workers and the trade union following the end of the dispute. “Dockers and other workers have been told throughout the pandemic that they play a critical role as key, frontline and essential workers. “Trade unions are now demanding this is translated into improved wages and conditions for workers across all sectors. “That employers and the Stormont Executive arent automatically backing these demands points up the problem of an economy catering to elites where the gap between the least well-off and those at the top has skyrocketed. “Workers across Derry, across the North and across Ireland should take confidence and example from the resilience of Foyle Port dockers. “This is what will need to happenwe are to ensure health workers, Council workers, Education support workers and all others begin to be treated with dignity, respect and more economic equality. “No one should be told they should wait for better days - this is the time to use solidarity and action to challenge poverty pay.” UNITE General Secretary, Sharon Graham, added: “This is a tremendous win for our members. “Having endured freezing cold and driving rain on long days on picket lines, the workers stood ready to escalate their strike action but their determination led to both employers making offers which met their demands in full. “This is a good news story for workers everywhere in Northern Ireland and shows that there is a power in our union. “It confirms yet again that when our members fight in unity for their jobs, pay and conditions they can win.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season.

Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Inpho Photography.Reporter: Daragh Ó Conchúir Dec Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, All-Ireland senior camogie semi-final Slaughtneil - googletag.cmd.push Oulart-the-Ballagh- First-half goals from Wexford legends Uacutena Leacy and Ursual Jacob and eight points from play by the Kehoe twins, Shelley and Stacey, ended Slaughtneil’s bid for a fth consecutive AIB All-Ireland senior club camogie final appearance, as  champions Oulart-The Ballagh held the former three-in-a-row victors at arm’sin the second half to prevail at Donaghmore Ashbourne by - to -. Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart. Given the final margin, the opening nine minutes were hugely signicant, at the end of which the red and blacks led by - to -. After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley, who gave birth to her first child earlier this year, slotted a couple of minors for Slaughtneill as they steadied the ship and added a third after winning a free from which Louise Dougan converted to leave it - to - at the first water break. The Slaughtneil team who lost out to Oulart-the-Ballagh. Pic by Inpho Photography. Cliodhna Niacute Mhianaacutein reduced the margin to a goal but catastrophe struck when following Shelley Kehoe’s point, Jacob’s free from m was deflected unfortunately by Dougan beyond Jolene Bradley to put seven between them once more. That margin had grown to ten by the interval and the Robert Emmets never looked like reeling it in from - to -. They tried valiantly, as you would expect however, Therese Mallon goaling in the first minute of the second half after a block by Ceacuteat McEldowney of Katie Gallagher’s attempted clearance. Orla McNeill followed quickly with a point but the Oulart riposte was notable, Uacutena Leacy, Shauna Sinnott and Shelley Kehoe firing the last three points of the third quarter to make it - to -. They only had to avoid a collapse from that juncture and with such experience in their ranks, that was never going to happen. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Inpho Photography.Reporter: Daragh Ó Conchúir Dec Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, All-Ireland senior camogie semi-final Slaughtneil - googletag.cmd.push Oulart-the-Ballagh- First-half goals from Wexford legends Uacutena Leacy and Ursual Jacob and eight points from play by the Kehoe twins, Shelley and Stacey, ended Slaughtneil’s bid for a fth consecutive AIB All-Ireland senior club camogie final appearance, as  champions Oulart-The Ballagh held the former three-in-a-row victors at arm’sin the second half to prevail at Donaghmore Ashbourne by - to -. Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart. Given the final margin, the opening nine minutes were hugely signicant, at the end of which the red and blacks led by - to -. After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley, who gave birth to her first child earlier this year, slotted a couple of minors for Slaughtneill as they steadied the ship and added a third after winning a free from which Louise Dougan converted to leave it - to - at the first water break.

Cliodhna Niacute Mhianaacutein reduced the margin to a goal but catastrophe struck when following Shelley Kehoe’s point, Jacob’s free from m was deflected unfortunately by Dougan beyond Jolene Bradley to put seven between them once more. That margin had grown to ten by the interval and the Robert Emmets never looked like reeling it in from - to -. They tried valiantly, as you would expect however, Therese Mallon goaling in the first minute of the second half after a block by Ceacuteat McEldowney of Katie Gallagher’s attempted clearance. Orla McNeill followed quickly with a point but the Oulart riposte was notable, Uacutena Leacy, Shauna Sinnott and Shelley Kehoe firing the last three points of the third quarter to make it - to -. They only had to avoid a collapse from that juncture and with such experience in their ranks, that was never going to happen. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

I, like many other families, cycle with my we and three small children and this space and environment to enjoy that time together safely and without fear of accident or injury is a blessing, said Cllr Lewis.ldquoNewry Mourne and Down Council proudly supports active and healthy communities and this cycle lane connects the local council to Stormont in a collective effort to improve the health and wellbeing of residents through the promotion of cycling and the enjoyment of outdoor leisure.Cllr Lewis also congratulated his Slieve Croob colleague, Cllr Andrew McMurray, who has been proactive in ensuring the district is marked on the map in terms of provision of safe cycle routes.He also revealed that Cllr McMurray has challenged him to a timed lap of the new route when it opens and hopes the event will raise money for a local charity, while the duo have a bit of fun along the way.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the Department for Infrastructure to consider the needs of those who need access to agricultural land that runs adjacent to the new pathway and cycling route, during construction and when it is completed.ldquoLand along this particular route is utilised for barley, potatoes and grazing, with the ground rotated each season which means that the fields are regularly in use throughout the year, he explained.ldquoPolice regularly pull in farmers driving along this stretch of road requesting that they facilitate traffic flow by waiting in a lay-by, allowing the build-up of traffic behind them to pass.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the government department consider how itrsquos going to accommodate agricultural or slow-moving traffic, suggesting that the original lay-by structure in the area needs to be maintained and protected to allow for safe access.He added: ldquoThese issues certainly arenrsquot impediments nor am I seeking to cause an obstruction.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

He and his we, Charlotte, live near Edinburgh and have three sons, Angus, Jack and Hector.His introduction to rowing came only six years ago when he took up skf racing. He competed at the  world championships in Strangford Lough where he won a silver medal and went on to win two gold medals at the  world championships in Stranraer.Clive admits to being highly competitive and that after winning world titles he was looking to take another step forward.A TV documentary about explorer Ben Fogle and Olympic rower James Cracknell rowing across the Atlantic fired his imagination and he signed up for the Talisker Atlantic Challenge in January  along with his medal-winning team-mates, Ian Baird, Duncan Hughes and Ross McKinney, plus a friend, Fraser Potter.They formed a team, Five in a Row, and then set about putting their project together, which involved the not inconsiderable matter of raising pound, to cover their costs.They managed to get the money and then obtained a boat, which, they were delighted to learn, had been rowed by three Scottish brothers in a previous Atlantic Challenge race.Clive says: ldquoIt was tough going, but we managed to raise the money.

The Planning Service has formally approved the plan which will see the Rowallane Inn transformed into a new -bedroom complex.Confirmation that approval has finally been given comes over a year after plans to develop a new hotel in Saintfield were made public and initially rejected by local planners.Politicians were also split over the plan, but amended drawings for the multi-million pound scheme have now been approved and Down councillors will be asked for their views on the scheme during their monthly meeting next Monday night.The plans also include the provision of a newroom, dining area and a lounge bar and the businessman behind the hotel project is delighted the scheme has finally been given the green light.Mr Frank Kearney said he hoped there will be no further obstacles placed int he way of a scheme he says has major benefits both for Saintfield and Down District.ldquoI believe Saintfield is an ideal town for a major hotel and the location of the Rowallane Inn at one of the busiest road junctions in Northern Ireland lends itself to such a development, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Shots were fired during the attempted robbery of a Securicor van in Downpatrick on Monday morning. Police officers lying in wait at the Safeway complex on the Ballydugan Road fired several shots when a cash delivery man was threatened with a replica firearm.Two men were arrested at the scene and appeared at a special court yesterday morning on a series of charges.The drama began at .am as the van arrived to deliver money to the Safeway store.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race. He was probably one of the youngest in the -strong field, having celebrated his th birthday a few days beforehand, so had no expectations and therefore maybe put less pressure on himself.He had a great run in the end, taking one minute and  seconds off his previous road k personal best and completing the course in .. He finished th and was the second Down team member home.Both boys have done their club proud and their parents also deserve medals for acting as support crew on multiple weekends. They will all be glad of a rest before racing resumes in January.Dillon in KGavin Hynds, as a long term member of East Down AC, was delighted when his son, Dillon, decided to follow in his footsteps by signing up to the EDAC junior section.Dillon has been attending sessions since September and gaining confidence each week, so when his school, Our Lady and St Patrick Primary, announced a fundraiser k fun run and walk he felt that he might be fit to take part as a runner.On Saturday morning despite the horrible weather conditions, he set off to the RGU in Downpatrick with Gavin as his sidekick. K is a long way at Dillonrsquos age, but to give him his due he stuck at it and made it to the finish with a bit of encouragement from his dad.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13227668.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: “I took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.“It is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.“This decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.“This decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.“These housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.“Since my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast – that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.“Keeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.“Adhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.“My officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.”To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: South East Wales Adoption Service“I think it’s important that we don’t shy away from talking about adoption.“At the start we didn’t realise exactly how hard it would be. But it’s all worthwhile and by adopting an older child you can discuss things with them and overcome them.”But adopting toddlers has come with some challenges. The couple explained that their children’s birth parents had been involved with the police, and the children remembered being moved from home to home growing up.The kids had been used to moving around from place to place when they were babies...We took them to a playdate and my daughter askedshe was coming back home with us.“The kids had been used to moving around from place to place when they were babies and that is something that definitely stuck with them initially,” said Caroline..remove“We took them to a playdate and my daughter askedshe was coming back home with us. I explained that she’d be coming home with us tonight and every single night. I guess they weren’t used to the fact that they were with us now forever.“The first time we met our children was so terrying, it felt surreal because of the induction process which took a long time.“We met our tiny children and they were both nervous. We all just chatted away and it was a lovely but scary moment.Siobhan and Caroline adopted three-year-old twins in . Picture: South East Wales Adoption Service“For us, it felt crazy and took us ages to get used to. Initially, we felt like we were babysitting someone ’s children, we still don’t know why but that’s just how it felt to us.“Once we went swimming and our daughter came out the swimming pool and shouted ‘mum’ and I was baffled. I looked around behind me and looked for my own mum. From that moment on, the kids were always comfortable with us and it became normal for them to call us mum.”The National Adoption Service is asking for people to share the moments that made their family to encourage others to choose to adopt, by tweeting @nas_cymru and using #ChooseFamily.For more information about adoption in Wales, visit adoptcymruAre you sure you want to delete this comment Yes, delete the commentNo, keep the commentReport This CommentGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Covid Pass system was introduced in Wales from October , meaning all over-s have to show evidence of either having received two vaccine doses or a negative test to enter nightclubs or large-scale events.However, test results which have been processed in Public Health Wales laboratories are not being accepted as evidence of a negative test by the Covid Pass system.:A Welsh Government spokesperson said they were “working on” getting the results displayed on the NHS Wales Covid Pass.“As well as using the NHS Covid Pass to show they have had both vaccines, people in Wales can provide evidence of a negative lateral flow test to get into venues,” said the spokesperson.“Around two thirds of PCR tests in Wales are processed via UK laboratories and the Covid Pass also includes tests that were taken at a community testing site or by home test. “We are working on getting results from Public Health Wales laboratories displayed on the NHS Wales COVID Pass and will be making an announcement shortly.”The system has a similar issue with people who have been vaccined in Northern Ireland.Monmouth MP David Davies raised concerns over Covid Passes with health minister Eluned Morgan after several of his constituents who had been vaccinated in Northern Ireland and abroad had reported it dficult to get a Covid Pass in Wales.In response, Ms Morgan said: “Currently we do not have a mechanism to ingest vaccination data from Northern Ireland into the appropriate systems that will allow data to be surfaced in a Covid Pass..remove“We are currently working to develop a solution and hope to have a process very soon.”In a further reply, Ms Morgan said that Covid Passes in Wales currently showed tests undertaken by NHS England laboratories, and that the Welsh Government is working on getting it to accept tests from NHS Wales laboratories.“It not only causes implications for residents who would like to use the NHS Covid Pass to travel or work abroad but means those affected are also unable to access Covid Passes that are now legally required in Wales,” said Mr Davies.“With the Welsh Government refusing to rule out the possibility of extending passes to the hospitality sector over Christmas for entry into pubs and restaurants, it is now absolutely imperative that everyone who has received doses of the vaccine can access this technology to ensure unnecessary restrictions are not placed on people on their home soil through no fault of their own.”For those whose test results do not appear on their Covid Pass, the Welsh Government said they can show a test result or previous Covid- infection notication using an email or text from NHS Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated – one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"We’ve set out our policy on this and we’ve said it’s not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were \"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workers – a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With the spread of Omicron has come new restrictions in England – one Wednesday, Boris Johnson announced the UK government would switch to its winter Plan B.Because health is devolved, that move has no direct impact on Wales – and in any case the new rules for England, such as Covid Passes for some events and venues, and the recommendation to work from home, have already been in place in Wales for months.But Ms Morgan will be meeting with first minister Mark Drakeford and other Welsh ministers today for the latest three-week review of the Covid rules. The results of that meeting, and any rule changes in Wales, will likely be confirmed this evening or on Friday.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:In the meantime, the service in Welsh NHS-run Covid testing laboratories will be increased to seven days a week in a bid to track the spread of Omicron.The health minister called the emergence of the new strain \"a sombre reminder that the pandemic is not yet over\".\"There is concern that the Omicron iant may be spread much faster than other iants,\" Ms Morgan added. \"It’s important we try to delay the spread of Omicron in Wales, and to do so we need to rapidly identy cases..remove\"Throughout the pandemic testing has played a crucial role and we want to swtly identy Omicron cases here in Wales.\"This alongside other measures already in place will help us once again to keep Wales safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySpeaking on BBC Radio Wales this morning, Dr Frank Atherton said: “It is the worst time of year to be considering this, but I think we just have to look at population mixing.“It is almost inevitable that we may have to consider what measures to reduce population mixing are needed at this point in time but that is for ministers to discuss and I will be providing advice on that.”Dr Atherton spoke after he and the other three chief medical officers in the UK agreed to raise the UK Covid alert level yesterday to level four. This does not change the current restrictions in place in Wales, which currently remains at alert level zero.Dr Atherton also said that the initial peak of the omicron iant was predicted to be around January or February - but rates are rising quicker than expected.“When I first heard about omicron, I thought it would be a problem in January and February. With these transmission rates we are far more likely to see a problem running into the Christmas period and then into early January. So that is why we felt the need to raise the alert level,” he said.He also highlighted things that people in Wales can do to help minimise the spread.He said: “It is unpalatable at this time of year to say this, but we need to think about contacts we are having because we know that this virus loves to transmit from person to person and we cannot afford to have large gatherings at this time of year because it will bring community transmission that we are fearful of.”He also highlighted the importance of the boosters and having the booster when people are called for. “We are seeing quite signicant numbers of people have been contacting the NHS to say they have got an appointment for their booster but are going to delay it and asking for another appointment,” he said..removeMORE NEWS:“That implies people aren’t prioritising it and that is natural when it is Christmas time and people are thinking about other things.\"What we are now saying is you cannot think about anything more important than getting your booster because we know that the vaccine effectiveness is reduced a bit but the protection with booster shots against serious harm is still about  per cent and so the best thing, we can do for ourselves, and our loved ones is to get your booster shots when you are eligible.”Dr Atherton explained that, although the Welsh Government had set a target of offering everyone in Wales aged  and over a booster jab by the end of January, they are working through to bring this forward. He said how there has been work over the weekend to increase this rollout and this could include walk-in clinics, extra vaccination clinics and more volunteers to allow for more vaccines to be administered quicker.He also advised that the rollout will prioritise the elderly and vulnerable first and that everyone over  should have received their invitation for a booster shot. Those who have not should contact their health board. Everyone  over the age of  should wait until they are contacted.He also confirmed that those who are housebound will be able to receive their boosters and that GPs have been given more money to prioritise these. Anyone over  who has not received and invite should contact the relevant health board.Dr Atherton said that, although there are only  cases of the omicron iant in Wales, he expects community transmission is on the rise as seen across the UK and in other nations. It was confirmed this morning by health minister Eluned Morgan that one person in Wales was in hospital with the omicron iant.Dr Atherton said: “It is inevitable as community transmission rises, two weeks later there will be a rise in people needing hospital treatment and needing oxygen and ITU treatment. And two weeks later sadly, a rise in deaths.”He added that decisions around introducing more restrictions were up to the ministers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Western Gateway is billed as a counterpoint to the Northern Powerhouse, attracting major government funding for huge region-wide infrastructure schemes.Including Cardf, Swansea, Newport, Bristol, Bath and Swindon, the Western Gateway group has now set out its priorities for next year.These include tidal energy—which could mean a barrage built across the Severn estuary—as well as enhancing the Great Western mainline railway, and boosting the regional economy.Cardf council leader Huw Thomas sits on the board of the Western Gateway and is its political lead on tidal energy. He said tidal energy in the Severn estuary could provide as much as seven per cent of the total energy needed across the UK.He said: “The UK government has so far refused to support a scheme due to a perceived requirement for high levels of public investment and concerns over the environmental impact on designated areas in the Severn estuary.“However, the changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as signicant. We want to find out what could be done to harness this incredible energy resource.”In October the group revealed it was setting up a new commission to explore building a barrage across the estuary, as well as exploring other options for tidal energy. A barrage had previously been looked at in depth about a decade ago but ultimately dropped as it was seen as too expensive and harmful to the environment.Regional groups such as the Western Gateway, and the more established Northern Powerhouse, are considered key in attracting huge levels of investment needed for major infrastructure projects, like improving the railways, as well as foreign direct investment..removeSpending per person on infrastructure construction is about  per cent higher in the Northern Powerhouse than across the Western Gateway region, Cllr Thomas said, without including the benefits from HS.He added: “HS represents a signicant improvement in connectivity across other parts of the country, putting the Western Gateway at risk of becoming worse off. South Wales and the west of England have not enjoyed the levels of rail enhancement investment experienced where in the UK over the past  years.“This underinvestment has led to relatively less attractive services, attracting fewer passengers, and leading to higher subsidies compared to the rest of the UK.“HS will put Cardf and south Wales at a signicant disadvantage. While the UK economy is predicted to receive a £ billion benefit from HS, south Wales’s GDP will lose an estimated £ million per year. There are similar negative impacts for the southwest of England, with Bristol losing £ million per year, and Gloucester, Bath and northeast Somerset another £ million annually.”To counter this, the Western Gateway is seeking investment for a range of railway upgrades. These include upgrading the South Wales Mainline and Great Western Mainline, running from Swansea through Cardf, Bristol and eventually leading to Heathrow and London. This could mean faster speeds, new stations, and full electrication.Other rail upgrades include improved links between Cardf Central and Bristol Temple Meads, with express and local commuter services, potentially with four services an hour between the two stations. Another upgrade would be to improve the links between Cardf and Birmingham via Gloucester, connecting to the HS network.Cllr Thomas said improving connectivity was “vital” in meeting climate goals and boosting the regional economy, by decarbonising transport and making jobs available to people living in rural areas.Katherine Bennett, who chairs the Western Gateway, said: “This is an exciting time for the Western Gateway. We believe that our area could become the UK’s first green energy supercluster and are working on a programme of work to integrate our strengths and assets across nuclear, hydrogen and tidal to create new opportunities for local communities at risk of being left behind.“We are looking forward to setting out plans for the powerhouse partnership next month at our first conference, Green Growth in the Western Gateway, where leaders from business, research and the public sector from both sides of the Severn will help shape how these plans are brought to le.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset. This horse drawn caravan has been meticulously cared for over the years and is a testament to its owners. I have no doubt this extremely rare wagon will be highly sought after and look forward to the outcome of the auction.”Bidding on the wagon will open on Wednesday, December  at pm.

I wanted to give something back to the community that I was living in.”Red Bay RNLI crew member Hazel ImrieWith no prior maritime, sailing or boating experience, Hazel fully immersed herself into the rigorous training involved in becoming a crew member.“I have valued the support of an experienced team and I have learned so much from others. Everyone has been so welcoming, and the training has been hands on, practical and a really enjoyable experience.”Now as Hazel prepares for her pager to sound, she says there is a mixture of emotions involved ahead of her first call out: “I am excited but there is also anticipation and concern because you are going into the unknown, but I am also reassured because I know when that call does come, everyone  who turns up is experienced and will support me.”Like Hazel, thousands of volunteer crew members around Ireland and the UK, sign up to save every one from drowning – it has been the charity’s mission since .This Christmas many will leave their loved ones behind to answer the call, each time hoping to reunite another family, and see those in trouble on the water safely ed. Over the past decade, RNLI leboats have launched over , times during the festive period. But these rescues would not be possible without donations from the RNLI’s generous supporters, helping to fund the essential kit, training and equipment needed by leboat crews all year round.Hazel said: “This is my first Christmas on call and I know even over the festive period, our lesavers are ready to drop everything and rush to the aid of someone in trouble on the water. At this time of year, the weather can be at its worst and lives can be on the line.“We know that every time our crews go out they hope for a good outcome, but sadly this sometimes isn’t the case. We hope that theappeal will show people how tough it can be, but also that with their help we can get so much closer to our goal of saving every one.”GlasgowPortrushAntrimLarne  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularMen praised by PSNI for saving ‘floating and unresponsive’ w...NewsHammer attack: extensive damage caused to cars in Cookstown...NewsPolice seize Class A and Class B drugs in Larne...NewsPolice seek information on missing woman last seen in Carric...NewsOuarry worker intends to do -mile round trip to work by bi...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"welcome to ni world a new website built on decades of great weekly newspaper journalism ","story":"Man with Larne address is accused of sex offences   Boy dies after road collision near GlenavyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleWelcome to NI World - a new website built on decades of great weekly newspaper journalismToday sees a new era for our titles with the launch of a new website that brings you all the great content from our local journalists with some great new features.By Valerie Martin, NI World EditorThursday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  Welcome to NI World As well as local news, views and issues about the towns and villages that matter to you, we will also be bringing you issues and information from across the region we all call home.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
