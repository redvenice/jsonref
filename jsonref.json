She returned the next day and under Government quarantine rules should have self-isolated for 14 days.Instead, she threw a birthday party on November 28 at the exclusive Casa Cruz restaurant in Notting Hill, west London.Ms Ora was forced to apologise last week after she and around 30 guests, including model Cara Delevingne, were photographed at the event before the end of the second national lockdown on Wednesday.While the singer said she was \u0027deeply sorry\u0027 for her actions and offered to pay a £10,000 fine for hosting the party, she did not mention her trip to Egypt or breaking a second set of strict rules. Kay Burley apologises over birthday party that broke coronavirus rules | Kay Burley | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Cars RECLAIM Kensington High Street cycle lane","story":"Share this articleLondon Assembly Member Mr Devenish added: \u0027I\u0027d like to thank our residents and residents\u0027 associations for working with RBKC to actually look at this scheme.\u0027It was a good idea but I\u0027m afraid it hasn\u0027t worked.

Anything that is done to promote active travel must be safe, fair, and balanced for all road users, including the elderly, children, and disabled. \u0027We would like to see the cycle lane remain until the end of the current lockdown on December 2. \u0027However, we believe that this scheme needs to be removed swiftly as soon as we exit lockdown, to allow businesses along the High Street a period of unimpeded business, in the run-up to Christmas, and following the very real difficulties they have faced during the coronavirus restrictions. \u0027Kensington High Street is simply not the correct location, and we must act in the interests of our constituents.\u0027   Speaking on the decision Cllr Johnny Thalassites, Lead Member for Transport, said: \u0027The cycle lane was a trial scheme to help those hopping on bikes during lockdowns and encourage shoppers to the High Street.

Last year the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the first try – an audacious attempt to merge Asda with larger rival Sainsbury’s that would have created a new market leader.The sale of Asda to the Issas and TDR Capital, who already co-own the EG Group forecourt business, was announced in the autumn. They are to own equal stakes in the business, with Walmart retaining a minority holding. The deal is being financed with £4bn of debt.The CMA said it had embarked on a “phase 1” investigation into the Asda deal after the European commission referred the deal. It will now look at whether the acquisition will lead to a “substantial lessening of competition” in the UK, with interested parties asked to submit their comments before Christmas.If at the end of this preliminary stage the watchdog is concerned about the sale of the UK’s third largest supermarket chain, with annual sales of £23bn, it will press the button on a more in-depth “phase 2” inquiry. The CMA must make a decision by 18 February.The Issas leased their first petrol station in 1999 and today have more than 6,000 dotted across 10 countries. However, EG’s rapid expansion has been funded by loans, with last year’s accounts showing a debt pile of about £7bn.On the surface, the sale of Asda to the consortium is not as controversial as last year’s merger which would have created a supermarket giant bigger than Tesco, the UK’s biggest retailer. One area of concern, however, might be the scale and overlap of their respective fuel businesses. Asda runs 320 filling stations while EG has a UK network of 341.The consortium says Asda will continue to be based in Leeds and that Roger Burnley will be retained as chief executive. It has also pledged to invest £1bn over three years, with a focus on growing Asda’s web and convenience arms. A new convenience brand, Asda on the Move, is already being trialled in a handful of EG’s forecourts.A spokesman for the Issa brothers and TDR Capital said they had expected the CMA to investigate the deal. “We are looking forward to working constructively with the CMA to address any questions they may have,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9ed28cd4cfe15cb497e7072e78afd2e3d16293/30_0_3441_2065/master/3441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c85dfb00accc14f394191f21ad5470f6","title":"g4s agrees to 38bn takeover by us rival allied universal","story":"Security firm with raft of UK government contracts accepts improved 245p a share offerSecurity firm G4S has agreed to a sweetened takeover offer from its US rival Allied Universal Security Services, which values the British company at £3.8bn.Under the terms of the cash offer, G4S shareholders would receive 245p a share. This is an improvement on the 210p a share previously offered by Allied Universal, which G4S said significantly undervalued the company.G4S, which operates services including running four British prisons and managing 21 UK Covid-19 test centres, has been heavily criticised following a series of scandals about its work on UK government contracts.Allied Universal said its offer included a significant premium on G4S’s share price at the beginning of the offer period in September.However, the UK firm’s stock has jumped in the last three months since a bidding war intensified between two of its overseas rivals, and its shares closed at 255p on Tuesday.G4S has been fighting off hostile takeover bids from its smaller Canadian suitor GardaWorld for several months. GardaWorld made a final bid of 235p a share earlier this month, valuing G4S at £3.68bn.The directors of Allied Universal and G4S said that the combined company would create a “world-leading integrated security business with revenues of approximately $18bn (£13.5bn), a strong international platform and an extensive portfolio of blue-chip clients across the public and private sectors”.G4S’s chairman, John Connolly, recommended that shareholders vote to accept the offer, which he said “represents an excellent opportunity to create a leading global security company, for shareholders to realise value for their investment at an attractive premium, while also ensuring the future success of G4S for employees, customers and other stakeholders”.Allied Universal said that US regulators had already given the go-ahead for the merger to proceed.G4S employs 533,000 people across 85 countries, with its biggest business in North America.The firm has repeatedly hit the headlines after being stripped of several government contracts, including its contract to run HMP Birmingham, but the majority of its work emanates from corporate contracts.G4S runs cash-handling services and provides security operations, including at the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f6c6aa5e433e2f47beea3b442bf8c48f927c548/1515_1426_6548_3929/master/6548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d191a51bb4802849d854fd13748d430","title":"ineos boss opts to build british heir to land rover defender in france","story":"Vocal Brexiter Sir Jim Ratcliffe vowed to make new Grenadier 4x4 in Bridgend but has now bought car plant at HambachBillionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe has chosen to build the “British” successor to the Land Rover Defender 4x4 in France, rather than Bridgend in Wales.Ratcliffe, who has built up an estimated £12.15bn fortune from petrochemicals company Ineos, announced on Tuesday that the Ineos Grenadier vehicle will be built at a former Mercedes-Benz factory in Hambach, close to the French-German border. The deal will “safeguard” 1,300 jobs at the factory, but dash hopes for an automotive revival in south Wales.Ratcliffe, a vocal Brexit supporter who recently left the UK for tax-free Monaco, said Hambach had presented the company with “a unique opportunity that we simply could not ignore”.He said that in Hambach, Ineos was buying “a modern automotive manufacturing facility with a world-class workforce”.“Ineos Automotive set out a vision to build the world’s best utilitarian 4x4, and at our new home in Hambach, we will do just that,” he added.Ratcliffe last year announced plans to build a factory in Bridgend and employ 500 British people building the new vehicle. “We have looked long and hard at possible manufacturing locations for Grenadier across the world with lots of good options to choose from,” he said in September 2019. “The decision to build in the UK is a significant expression of confidence in British manufacturing, which has always been at the heart of what Ineos stands for.”When Ratcliffe announced plans for the Grenadier – which is named after the pub near Buckingham Palace where he first conceived of the idea – the billionaire said: “Our preference is to build it in the UK.“We’d like to retain the Britishness and have a bit of passion about UK manufacturing,” he told Sun readers at the time. “We believe that Britain can produce something as reliable as Germany or Japan if we do it well.”However on Tuesday, Ratcliffe announced that Ineos had bought the Hambach factory from Mercedes-Benz and would start building the 4x4 there in late 2021. “The acquisition secures the future of the site and safeguards many jobs that might otherwise have been lost,” Ineos said.Dirk Heilmann, chief executive of Ineos Automotive, said: “This acquisition marks our biggest milestone yet in the development of the Grenadier. Alongside the exhaustive testing programme that our prototype vehicles are now undergoing, we can now begin preparations at Hambach to build our 4x4 from late next year for delivery to our customers around the globe.”Ratcliffe said he came up with the idea of pumping £500m into creating a successor to the Defender over beers in the Grenadier pub in Belgravia, London.He had already selected German, rather than British, engineers to create the designs for the vehicle.The Ineos chairman and majority shareholder said he wanted to create a “rugged, uncompromising, no frills” successor to the Defender because of his love for the original, which is also a favourite of the Queen.“When I’m on safari in Africa I always prefer to be in a Land Rover,” he said. “But I always carry a picnic basket.”Jaguar Land Rover ceased producing the original design of the Land Rover Defender in 2016 after 68 years but plans to make its own all-new version.According the latest Sunday Times rich list, Ratcliffe is worth just over £12bn, making him the fifth richest person in the UK.

Here he is, look, talking to Sky News about the doomed track-and-trace system, giggling in front of a faux-punk portrait of the Queen. Here he is, look, threatening Piers Morgan that he’ll take the vaccine on live television. And here he is – and yes, I’ve just watched it back again to make sure – here he is crying on Good Morning Britain, because someone called William Shakespeare took the vaccine, and that man was British. I grew up on a steady diet of Zig and Zag, so I’m fairly used to waking up to watch puppets being controlled by hands inserted into their darker regions, but I do think the 2020 reboot needs to work in the realism department.Are we all right? Matt Hancock, who is pretending to cry on TV by holding a single finger to a dry eye and then laughing – I don’t want to “gatekeep crying” but that is simply not how it is done – clearly isn’t all right. With Tuesday morning’s rollout making household names of Coventry grandmother Margaret Keenan (the first person to take the PfizerBioNTech vaccine outside of trials) and William Shakespeare (the first person named William Shakespeare to take the vaccine out of trials), it’s totally understandable that this news would bring with it a small, squirming feeling of hope. But then Hancock dabs his bone-dry eyes again and says something like, “There’s so much work that’s gone into this and it really, really … I’m just proud to be British”, and: ah. Are you? Really? Why?I suppose it is hardwired into the British condition to react to any hardship big or small by doubling down on dumb patriotism, but I do really think it is worth saying that “Germany developed the vaccine, all we did was buy it” before we plan a too-many-Red-Arrows flyover.There’s an old dunk the British like to perform on Americans about the second world war – “You took your time getting involved!”, men born in 1965 like to joke with men born in 1978, in bars and pubs across the free world – and it relates to some complex neuroses about valour, sacrifice and having had comparatively easy lives: I don’t know. Britain being the first country to roll out a Covid vaccine feels less of a gritty victory won in the trenches and on the beaches, and more like camping overnight for three days outside an Apple store to be the first to buy an iPhone: like yeah, you did it, but it’s very difficult to respect you for it.Big week for patriotism though, isn’t it? Kate and William – who, if you haven’t got up to that bit in The Crown yet, are the good honest millennial-era royals we like, and not the workshy millennial-era ex-royals we hate – are doing a tour of Scotland and Wales, for some reason, but on a train this time, so it’s fun. Part of me was hoping they’d see the reality of British train travel and revolutionise it from the inside – Prince William, so affected by being shimmied out of his chair by two people with five people’s luggage who insist that they’ve booked his table, then sitting on a fold-down seat by the toilets and having his £9 cheese toastie interrupted by people who need a crap repeatedly asking him, “Is there anyone in there, mate?”, like what am I, the Toilet Master? – but then I found out they’re travelling via royal train.So at no point in their tour will they have to confront the strange sewage-y smell of every single carpet on certain expensive train operators. Prince William will never have to idle for half an hour at Rhyl. At no point will Kate have to fumble through her bags to produce a millennial railcard which – both she and the inspector know full well – expired several years ago. This was an opportunity lost.Still, you have to wonder what those encountering the royals in Vaccine Week are feeling. Existential apathy, I’m suspecting. On a week where the long-awaited vaccine is finally rolling out but things are still extremely bad, pandemic-wise, Kate and William are doing a frontline worker-thanking tour but not actually taking the vaccine with them, so it’s just two royals turning up, slightly flouting domestic Covid regulations, to politely say: hallo.“Just you?” paramedics would be forgiven for thinking, as a flurry of photographers stop them working in the middle of the day to make them line up and keep their distance from two strangers. “No … no vaccine for us or anything?”There’s just – sorry, I’m tearing up. There’s just so much work that’s gone into this pointless train tour of the UK, you know? And it really, really … I’m just proud to be British.• Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7adf1604f3d2e5a97b53bb7a21854588dda7a386/0_0_3067_1850/master/3067.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2d82b4532b1c70f9c9a8e4c22dc80382","title":"how darjeeling express and dishoom put a fresh spin on tradition to shift the tastes of modern britain","story":"The founders of two of the UK’s most pioneering Indian restaurants changed the nation’s perception of the cuisine by drawing on the old waysThe first Indian restaurant in Britain opened more than two centuries ago – almost as long ago, in fact, as the earliest Scotch whisky distilleries – so it’s no surprise that curry is so firmly embedded in the nation’s psyche. But the days of the homogenous chicken tikka masala or korma are firmly in the past, as a new breed of restaurateurs have spiced up the nation’s palate with their original thinking and modern perspectives on Indian cuisine. And despite a tumultuous year for the restaurant industry, this culinary revolution shows no signs of abating.Think of game-changing Indian restaurants in Britain and a leading contender has to be Dishoom. Inspired by, and putting a fresh twist on, the Irani cafes of Mumbai, it sparked a wave of new restaurants, all bent on pushing boundaries and unearthing the richly-varied culinary lore of India.“Before Dishoom, certainly in London, there was a sense of Indian food just being about curries,” says its co-founder Shamil Thakrar. “Dishoom allowed for more regionally-focused Indian cuisine, and for people to mess around with small plates and cocktails. When others saw we were successful, they thought: ‘We could do something like that.’ There are some fantastic restaurants that have come up subsequently, like Gymkhana or Gunpowder.”For housewife-turned-chef Asma Khan, the notion of refining tradition has taken the form of unwinding the templated feel of the typical high-street curry house, and going back to the roots of Indian cooking – an authentic labour of love, served with the warmth of the home. Darjeeling Express began life in 2012 as a supper club, as Khan experimented with the old family recipes she’d grown up eating in Kolkata. Within five years, she had opened her restaurant to such acclaim that, before long, she had appeared in her own episode of Netflix’s Chef’s Table (the first British chef to do so).At Darjeeling Express, in central London, slow-cooked dishes such as lamb dum biryani and fish malaikari are designed to be shared, while the chef looks on, a warm presence in the dining room rather than staying hidden in the kitchen. “I see the people come in and, like a grandmother, I watch while they eat,” says Khan. “I want people to relive that moment of knowing that someone loves you enough to cook for you. It is the reason for cooking – it should not be to impress.”If Darjeeling Express makes diners feel right at home, then Dishoom, which now has eight restaurants across London, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, is like the friendly cafe down the road whose door is always open. It’s charming, immersive and stylish thanks to mid-20th century Irani cafe design details such as marble tables, ceiling fans and family portraits. Dishoom’s signature staples such as vada pav and black dal, not to mention the legendary bacon naan breakfast rolls, ensure customers return again and again, often queuing round the block for a table.“The idea of cafes doesn’t feel very Indian, so it was lovely to change the way people thought about urban India and its food,” says Thakrar. “Irani cafes were some of the early spaces in India that brought together different walks of life – the taxi driver, the barrister, the artist – in one place to eat. I remember when we opened in Shoreditch, there were hipsters in their skinny jeans and big glasses standing in the queue next to old Indian aunties.”Having non-culinary backgrounds seems to have enabled both restaurateurs to envision new takes on the norm. Thakrar worked as a corporate strategist and then as a director at his family-owned business before co-founding Dishoom Khan, meanwhile, did a PhD in British Constitutional Law before eventually deciding to pursue “the dream of cooking for others”.“I don’t cook the way people think Indian people cook, I don’t measure,” says Khan, who taught herself using her mother’s recipes when she was homesick after her move to Cambridge from India in the early 1990s. “Cooking is about tasting and layering and balancing. There’s a whole journey of different flavours. Even though it’s spicy, the chilli should not dominate – and if it does, you’re a bad cook!”Innovation is not only to be found on the plate, of course. A point of pride at Darjeeling Express is its all-female kitchen, where the average age is 50. Khan likes to employ people from an immigrant background who don’t have professional culinary skills, because they remind her of herself.While Thakrar might not be as hands on in the kitchen at Dishoom – where executive chef Naved Nasir reigns – the skills he brings to the table are just as essential for the brand to remain ahead of the game.Thakrar is an inveterate storyteller, even creating a fresh narrative theme that closely informs the concept and design of each new branch of Dishoom. He imagines who might have launched the cafe, and who its patrons might have been, had it opened in Mumbai – which Thakrar, evoking its more freewheeling older days, refers to it by its former name.“It takes you to a different time and place and offers you a sense of immersion,” he says. “I love the idea that you can take these stories and make them whimsical and beautiful, and teach someone a bit of history, and then finally you get to taste this delicious food. For people who know Bombay, it is transporting, and for everyone else it’s putting the food and drink in the right cultural context.”The restaurant industry, like so many others, is facing up to the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, and both Thakrar and Khan have had to innovate and adapt. Dishoom now offers a delivery service and – taking advantage of the popularity of its breakfasts – an at-home bacon naan kit. Darjeeling Express has launched a takeaway deli menu even while going ahead with plans to open a new, larger site in Covent Garden in December.As a year like no other continues to redefine the once gloriously-normal pleasure of dining out and exploring the nuances of global cuisines, restaurateurs such as Khan and Thakrar continue to pave the way – shifting perceptions and pushing boundaries even as they honour traditions.Original by TraditionThe Glenlivet is the original Speyside Single Malt and has been breaking traditions to set new standards in whisky since 1824.

Our experts share the drinks they’ll be serving up as the nights draw inThe golden hue of autumn leaves, the scent of woodsmoke and bonfires … there’s no spirit that better captures the feeling of autumn than a single malt. But single malts have, for unfathomable reasons, long been the purview of the connoisseur. What better season to usher in the realisation that they can also star in some truly tasty cocktails that are perfect for the weeks ahead?Here’s an array of five moreish cocktails to see you through the long autumn nights. The classically floral and fruity flavours of Speyside-style whisky are at the forefront, yet enhanced by the fresh new twist of deliciously innovative ingredients.The rusty hues of an Old Fashioned look like autumn in a glass. Bobby Hiddleston, bartender and co-founder of Swift Bar in Soho, London, adds a further seasonal twist to this absolute classic by swapping out the slightly summery citrus of orange for the earthy October flavours of plum and pear.How to make itMix in a glass 50ml The Glenlivet 12 Year Old, 25ml umeshu, 10ml crème de poire and add two dashes of lemon bitters for the tart kick of a classic old fashioned. Add a big cube of ice and garnish with a twist of lemon peel.Espresso Martinis are so last season. Instead, try a warming batch of Spiced Speyside Coffee, the ultimate whisky cocktail when you have friends over. This one’s made for long nights chatting by the fire, or a delicious pick-me-up as group energy levels start to waiver.“The character of The Glenlivet 12 Year Old stands up to the flavour of the coffee, while the hint of cayenne pepper complements the spice of the single malt,” says The Glenlivet’s head of heritage and education Alex Robertson.How to make itFor intimate autumnal gatherings, whip up a batch for four. Take 160ml of The Glenlivet 12 Year Old, 60ml coffee syrup, 40ml sugar syrup, 300ml americano coffee, and ½ tsp cayenne pepper. Mix together in a warmed glass jug. Pour into four long-stemmed glasses, and top with lightly whipped double cream, drained over a spoon into each glass to form a layer on top. Garnish with chocolate flakes and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper.As the rays of a low sun stream through the trees, crack out the blender for a cocktail that blends the last throes of summer with the chilly days of autumn. Dubbed The Glenlivet Colada by whisky writer Felipe Schrieberg, the pineapple juice works nicely with the flavour profile of The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve – which is selectively finished in Caribbean rum barrels – and whispers a faint memory of warmer days, while the warm hit of cinnamon brings in the smoky-sweet hint of autumn.“Pina coladas are my (not very) guilty pleasure, any season, and using a gentle, sweeter whisky like The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve serves as a perfectly lovely substitute for rum,” says Schrieberg, who is currently running virtual whisky masterclasses all autumn over Zoom.How to make it Add 50ml of The Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve to 120ml pineapple juice, 60ml coconut cream, a dash of bitters, and a splash of cinnamon syrup. Pulse together in a blender with crushed ice. Garnish with pineapple leaves and a stick of cinnamon.As the nights draw in, cuddle up on the sofa with a calming nightcap. The Glenlivet’s Small Voice of Calm cocktail is a soothing mix of chamomile, whisky and lemon: the perfect tonic after a long day of video calls and endless emails.“The floral notes in The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve are brought out by the chamomile, while the sharp lemon notes complement the sweetness of the whisky,” says Robertson.How to make itPour 50ml The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, 25ml chamomile syrup, and 10ml lemon juice into a cocktail shaker and lightly shake to mix the ingredients. Strain over cubed ice in a short glass and top up with 100ml chilled soda water. Garnish with chamomile flowers or a wedge of lemon.As the cold weather draws in, the temptation is to stay indoors. Stick the kettle on and rustle up some company – a luxurious Hot Toddy. Served in an enamel mug, it’s like a tiny hot-water bottle for your hands and warms your insides. This is a favourite of whisky writer and Instagrammer The Whisky Lady, AKA Anne-Sophie Bigot.“As the temperatures drop, autumn is all about warming up and being cosy, and for me whisky cocktails are definitely part of the equation. A good scotch hot toddy on the couch, sat by a crackling woodfire is a must. It screams autumn vibes to me,” says Bigot.How to make itBest built in an enamel mug, take 50ml of The Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, add 15ml lemon juice and 15ml ginger syrup for a spicy kick. Swirl together with a couple of dashes of bitters. Top with hot water and garnish with a slice of lemon studded with cloves for that sweet, peppery aroma that whispers of frosty nights.The Glenlivet is the original Speyside single malt, setting new standards since 1824.

Surely that game is not going to restart, no matter Uefa’s wishes. “On Beinsport Turkey, the reporter in place said that Demba Ba doesn’t want come back to game and sit on the bench,” emails Alp Ulagay, a Turkish sports writer based in London. “It was said that some of the players are with him. The players are still in a meeting between themselves to decide on whether to continue to the game or not.”From bad to worse. Surely that’s it for United, who look resigned to the Europa League. Justin Kluivert reacts quickest in the box and Julian Nagelsmann cannot wipe the smile off his face. He dinks the ball in over De Gea. Maguire and Brandon Williams were static. 66 min: Krasnodar have just forced Kepa into a smart save down to his right. Chelsea have been fairly timid. Few players are staking their claim for a regular spot in Frank Lampard’s starting lineup. Remember Chelsea made 10 changes.65 min: Manchester United still trail RB Leipzig by two goals in Germany, while Chelsea are level-pegging with Krasnodar at Stamford Bridge. Elsewhere, QPR players celebrated taking the lead against Millwall by taking the knee.61 min: Half-hour to play around the grounds. At Parc des Princes, there is still no sign of the game being restarted. “We’re at a disturbing tipping-point, not a week goes by without an incident involving race,” says the former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand. Here’s more on events in Paris:57 min: Chelsea are huffing and puffing. Elsewhere, the hold-up at the Parc des Princes seems to revolve around Istanbul Basaksehir being unhappy that the fourth official involved in that first-half incident, Sebastian Coltescu, could still play a part in the game, if restarted. They are adamant Coltescu should not be involved, even if he swaps places with Marco Di Bello, the video assistant referee.55 min: GOAL! Dynamo Kiev lead Ferencvaros in Group G. A free-kick is head in by Popov. As it stands, that would be enough to send the Ukraine side into the Europa League.Uefa release a statement on PSG v Istanbul Basaksehir being suspended: “Following an alleged incident involving the 4th official, the match was temporarily suspended. After consultation with both teams, it was agreed that the match would restart with a different 4th official. Uefa will thoroughly investigate the matter and further communication will be made in due course.”He sends Ter Stegen the wrong way. Ronaldo 3-0 Messi.50 min: The rest of the games are back under way. No changes at Stamford Bridge, but Donny van de Beek is on for Manchester United in Leipzig. Meanwhile, Juventus have a penalty at Camp Nou ... Ronaldo will take it! ...PSG’s players are in the tunnel ready to go ... but there is no sign of the Istanbul Basaksehir players yet. “As far as we know Başakşehir would not to return to pitch unless the fourth official is immediately dismissed, as stated by a club official to Turkish public TV channel Trt Spor,” emails Alp Ulagay, a Turkish sports writer based in London. If the fourth official remains involved, as reported, that might put pay to any restart. Things still remain unclear at the Parc des Princes.PSG v Istanbul Basaksehir is reportedly due to restart at 9pm (GMT), so in a few minutes, presumably without the fourth official involved in that first-half incident. The Istanbul assistant, Pierre Webo, was sent off before Ba confronted the official. Webo was shown a straight red card in the 16th minute before the players refused to continue the match amid allegations of racism by the fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu. Webo was sent off following a touchline row. The Turkish club appeared to be accusing the Romanian fourth official of using a racist term.44 min: Details on exactly what has happened at the Parc des Princes are unclear – but the commotion clearly centres on alleged racial abuse. We await confirmation of events which led the game to be suspended midway through the first half. 42 min: Demba Ba was livid with the Romanian fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu. In a clip of the moment the striker confronted Coltescu, Ba can be heard remonstrating. “You never say ‘this white guy’, you say: ‘these guys,’” Ba says. “So, listen to me, why when you mention a black guy do you have to say ‘this black guy?’” 37 min: Demba Ba was clearly incensed by something. There are images of the former Chelsea striker, a substitute in the game, railing at the Romanian fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu. Leonardo, the PSG sporting director, ended up on the pitch remonstrating with the officials. Both teams walked off the pitch in solidarity.32 min: News of events in Paris is staggering, if reports are true that the reason both sets of players have headed for the dressing room is because of alleged racial abuse. There are reports such abuse was directed towards Demba Ba. Meanwhile Leipzig have had a third goal ruled out by the VAR. Manchester United breathe a sigh of relief.Play has been suspended at the Parc des Princes. There are reports of alleged racial abuse, from the fourth official towards the Istanbul Basaksehir assistant manager, Pierre Webo, and both sets of players have walked off the pitch.Hop, skip and jump, and it’s in.26 min: Chelsea have a penalty ... Abraham is upended in the box!It had been coming. The Russians pour down the left, the ball is worked in to Cabella inside the box and he proceeds to give Kepa, in goal for the night, the eyes and hammer a low shot into the corner. Chelsea trail.20 min: Chelsea are not having too much fun at Stamford Bridge. Krasnodar are enjoying plenty of possession and are the ones asking questions. Lampard wants more.Juve double their advantage in style. Pjanic loses possession against his former club, Cuadrado crosses and Weston McKennie acrobatically thumps in on the volley. Cristiano Ronaldo strikes at Camp Nou for his 113th Champions League goal. Ronaldo rolls it down the middle of the goal after being fouled following neat buildup by Ramsey and Cuadrado.12 min: Krasnodar have a go at goal – but a volley sails well over Kepa’s bar! 10 min: Chelsea are ticking along without too much fuss. They are yet to create a clear-cut chance. A reminder that Dortmund and Lazio progressed to the last 16 from Group F earlier. Jude Bellingham played 90 minutes in Turin. They fell behind to Sebastian Driussi’s strike before goals by Lukasz Piszczek and Axel Witsel, via a Jadon Sancho assist, turned it around. Youssoufa Moukoko, at 16 years and 18 days, became the youngest player to feature in a Champions League match when he came on as a substitute. The last-16 draw takes place on Monday. The big question is: will Manchester United join them?6 min: Billy Gilmour takes aim from 25 yards but it smacks Abraham en route. The rangy striker is all smiles. Chelsea have nothing to worry about tonight, after all. Elsewhere, Huddersfield lead Tony Pulis’s Sheffield Wednesday 2-0.4 min: Chelsea are playing some nice stuff early on, with Emerson’s searching cross getting the fans going. It bounces in the box but Tammy Abraham cannot reach it. Lampard has made 10 changes but this team would worry most Premier League sides.Championship: a couple of early goals at Vicarage Road, with Troy Deeney doubling Watford’s advantage against Rotherham. They’re two goals to the good.We’re under way in Barcelona, Paris and beyond.Here we go, then! Chelsea’s second string waltz on to the Stamford Bridge pitch before a crowd of 2,000 spectators ...So close, but so far. Vanaken’s equaliser is insufficient as goals by Ciro Immobile and Joaquín Correa are ultimately enough to help the Italians progress.Axel Witsel’s winner secures top spot in Group F.Meanwhile, Ed Aarons is at Millwall v Queens Park Rangers in theIn injury time, 10-man Club Brugge have just smacked the crossbar. Had that gone in, they would’ve snatched the second spot in Group F ... into the fifth minute of stoppage-time we go!Messi v Ronaldo at Camp Nou: any predictions? Group F latest: Borussia Dortmund are sitting pretty at the top with just a couple of minutes to play in Russia. They’re 2-1 up at Zenit courtesy of an Axel Witsel strike. Meanwhile, despite playing with 10 men for 50 minutes, Hans Vanaken equalised for Club Brugge against Lazio in Turin. As it stands, Lazio would sneak through to the last 16 from second place. Stoppage time is fast approaching ...On a make-or-break night for Manchester United, much hinges on how Paris Saint-Germain fare in Turkey. Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side will reach the Champions League knockout stages if they return from RB Leipzig with a point, while PSG hope to seal a place in the last 16 without breaking sweat and will top Group H regardless of results elsewhere, providing they beat Istanbul Basaksehir. If United lose and PSG win, it is game over as far as the Champions League is concerned. If things do go pear-shaped, then United will face the rigamarole of Thursday-night fun in the Europa League. Meanwhile Chelsea, who have already secured top spot in Group E with a game to spare, will welcome Kepa Arrizabalaga back between the sticks against Krasnodar, who are guaranteed to advance to the Europa League. Elsewhere, Barcelona and Juventus do battle at Camp Nou having both already lit cigars and cruised into the knockout stages at the expense of Dynamo Kiev and Ferencvaros, who duel in Ukraine. Games in Group F, Club Brugge’s visit to Lazio and Zenit v Dortmund, are already under way. If Brugge triumph in Turin, they will advance to the last 16.

The keeper gets down well to save.71 min: Gulacsi tips a shot by McTominay around the post for a corner, then punches said corner to safety.Dithering in the United defence is punished by Kluivert! While Maguire and De Gea wondered who would deal with a ball rolling across the six-yard area, Kluivert nipped in and beat the keeper with an artful dink! 67 min: Freekick to United near the left-hand corner to the left of the Leipzig D. Fernandes curls a beauty over the wall ... and against the crossbar! 66 min: Fernandes fires off a dipping, swerving shot from over 25 yards. The keeper plunges to his left to push it behind, though it may have been heading wide. “At the risk of lobbing an incendiary sentiment into this mbm, isn’t having an underwhelming ‘star” player as much a part of the modern-era United DNA as anything else?” chips in Grant Tennille. “Veron, Forlan, Di Maria, Schweinsteiger...

Lindelof blocks it. Then Kluivert gets booked for trying to pull back Fernandes.United substitutions: Can Pogba be United’s hero? He’s on for Shaw. And Williams has replaced Matic.60 min: Shaw’s freekick from the let fails to beat the first man. United’s ratio of rubbish setpiece deliveries to good ones sinks further.Leipzig substitutions: Kluivert and Poulsen on, Olmo and Forsberg off.55 min: Fernandez sends a lovely freekick from the right bouncing across the face of goal. Maguire strains in an effort to get his head to it at the back post but he misses it’s fractionally beyond him! That’s the best setpiece delivery from United all night.55 min: Fernande with an outswinging corner from the right. Nkunu heads it away at the near post.54 min: The threat from United is growing. They are looking much sharper, passing more snappily and running more ambitiously. 52 min: Rashford zigzags in from the left, working his way to the edge of the area and then feeding it wide. But the cross is cut out.50 min: United force a couple of corners but they’re well defended.49 min: Nice play by United. Some dinky one-touch passing in the opposing half, with Van de Beek continually making the sort of proactive runs beyond the last defenders that were missing in the first period.47 min: Van de Beek’s first touch was to give the ball away. Leipzig have started the brighter, though not to the same extent as they did in the first half.46 min: Van de Beek is on, in place of Telles. Presumably that means United are switching to a back four.“Aren’t you forgetting that United could go through if Basaksekir win in Paris?” hollers Gordon Dempsey. That would make no difference to United, Gordon, because PSG have a better record in the head-to-head game between the two.“Ole has Leipzig exactly where he wants them!” chirps Peter Oh.Time to enact Plan B, Ole. United looked bewildered in the first half hour of this game and found themselves two goals before they got any sense of what their opponents were up to. Indeed, they were mighty close to falling three goals behind. They improved in the last 15 minutes and worked themselves into some threatening positions. But they need to get a lot sharper and more nimble to mount a comeback here. Otherwise their Champions League campaign is over .... unless something outrageous happens in the other game.45 min: There will be at least two more minutes before half-time...43 min: Leipzig break after a bout of pressure from United. Shaw takes out an attacker on half-way and cops a booking. Then the ref strides over to the United dugout to administer a stern telling-off to everyone who objected to his decision.41 min: Rashford is fouled near the right-hand corner flag. Fernandes delivers the freekick beyond the far post. McTominay nuts it back into the danger zone, and Leipzig eventually clear. 39 min: McTominay releases Rashford after United win possession in midfield. Rashford tries to weave his way between the last two defenders but magic eludes him.37 min: Maguire gets a meaty header to a corner by Telles but it’s blocked by Konaté. And the ref blows for a foul by McTominay anyway.36 min: For the second time in the evening, poor old Wan-Bissaka tries an extravagant piece of skill and winds up embarrassing himself. This time his attempted shot with the outside of his foot at the edge of the area results in him falling over. 35 min: Sabitzer booked for taking down McTominay in midfield after a strong run by the Scot.33 min: As if buoyed by the VAR let-off, United begin to enjoy applying a bit of pressure at the other end. But it comes to nought.United breathe a sign of relief, as Orban’s goal is chalked off. He was in an offside positions when someone else’s header cam back off the post, which is why he was on hand to prod in the rebound. Meanwhile, the other match in this group - between PSG and Basahsekir - has been paused because of a racist incident. More details as I get them. Leipzig think they have made it 3-0 but the video ref is checking whether Orban was offside. 28 min: Wan-Bissaka confuses himself as he tries to play his way out of trouble, coughing up possession. Leipzig sweep forward and Shaw has to scamper across to clear before Forsberg can pounce. “I have a feeling that Solskier’s ‘we love to make it difficult for ourselves’ comment will come to haunt him,” suggests Fatsani Sonny Gunya. “I don’t see teams allowing United’s come back kings mantra play their minds. As for this German machine, I sense it’s well oiled for the knockout stages!”25 min: United have improved, which was almost inevitable. Kongate concedes a freekick wide on the left by shunting over Greenwood. Telles wafts it into the area, offering Gulacsi an easy catch. “So what do you do when you’ve set your team up to be as defensive as possible and concede two in the first 20 minutes?” ask23 min: Freekick to United, about 25 yards out, to the right of the D. Fernandes blasts it into the wall and then clips the rebound towards Maguire at the far post. It’s erted behind for a corner. Telles takes it, Greenwood nod over the bar.20 min: United are trying to assert themselves somewhat, or at least circulate the ball a bit. But they have shown none of Leipzig’s movement or pizzazz and are being kept at bay quite easily. “Just read Justin Kavanagh’s thoughts and one match springs to mind, the World Cup final where he scored the winning goal,” recalls Harry Crane, though it would be more accurate to say Pogba scored one of the winning goals and did not dominate the game. “I really can’t be doing with this lazy discourse that he hasn’t tried or hasn’t performed for United, when he has been in the team he’s been first for everything that matters (goals, assists, passes) but for some reason because he doesn’t scream at people when the rest of the team around him is terrible its his fault.” There’s some validity to that comment, but the point really is that goals, assists and passes are not the only thing that matter (and he should often prompt faster with passing). But, you know, chances are United are going to ask him to come on and help rescue them here in the second half. He could have the last laugh yet. Whatever happens. 16 min: What do you know, Angelino is galloping down the let again like a giddy little pony in a wide open prairie. And when the cross comes in, Forsberg is in splendid isolation right in front of United’s goal. He takes a touch but then prods the ball wide from 10 yards. That sloppy finish aside, United are being schooled here. Achtung! United are in a world of bother! Once again they have been left flummoxed by Leipzig’s movement. This time Angelino clipped over a cross from the right and Haidara was free to run on to it and rasp a fierce shot into the net! It’s remarkable how often Leipzig manage to find a free player. 10 min: Wan-Bissaka cuts out a cross from Angelino, who ran on to yet another diagonal pass. The resultant corner is cleared.9 min: That’s better from United! The chance came from a counter, of course, as Greenwood dashed down the right and cut on to his left foot as he got into the box and cracked off a low shot that demanded a save from the keeper.7 min: Angelino, pushed very far forward on the left, collects another crossfield pass and motors into the box. This time Wan-Bissaka is quick to close him down but the man on loan from Man City still gets a shot off, without enough power to bother De Gea. 5 min: No sign of a response yet from United, who still look stodgy. Leipzig are positively effervescent in comparison. 3 min: So Solskjaer’s yet again finds himself hoping for another stirring fightback. His side have hardly started so far, although Fernandes has managed to pick up a yellow card to complicate matters. Oh my, what a start! And how easy it was for Leipzig! They had all of the ball sicne kickoff and were allowed to build gradually down the right and then a send over a cross. Angelino ran on to it at the far side of the box under absolutely no pressure and walloped a terrific low shot into the far corner! Here comes the teams. There are no fans in the stadium so the booming rendition of the Champions League jingle is solely for the benefit of the players and officials. Leipzig are in their white jerseys with red and yellow go-faster trims, while United are back in black (just in case you wanted a different ear worm to the Champions League tune).“Scholes might have a point if this was the first time Raiola had sounded off like this,” ventures Mark Gillespie. “However, as it’s been a running theme for as long as he’s been at the club, unless and until he does sack him or reign him in, the only conclusion we can draw is that Pogba is happy with the statements. The agent is the representative of the player and works for him, there is no justification for giving players leeway if their agents make comments like this, as they choose who represents them in the media.”“We need everyone, all the 11 player who start and the subs who come on, to perform at their best.” Asked to what extent Pogba’s omission was determined by his agent’s comments, Solskjaer replies: “My decision tonight is obviously tactical. That’s the only thing. We made a team decision way before this game. We decided on Scott and Nemanja in midfield before we played West Ham.” Though he then adds: “For me you prepare for every single game as if it’s your last one, more or less. We know we’ve got City on Saturday but that doesn’t matter now.” “What does Donny Van De Beek have to do to get a consistent run in this team?” demands Ian Palmer. “Matic and McTominay are in ahead of him. I know who I would least rather face if I were the opposition.” Entirely different kinds of players, no? And Van De Beek didn’t exactly seize his opportunity at West Ham at the weekend. Discussing the recent comments made by Paul Pogba’s agent - to wit, that he si determined to leave Man United - Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes take slightly different views: Ferdinand thinks United should have showed Pogba’s agent - and others - who’s boss and refused to give them the feeling the can sound off as they please without consequences Scholes, meanwhile, thinks the onus is on Pogba to get a handle on his agent whose utterances, according to Scholes, risk creating the false impression that Pogba is “a bad lad, trouble in the dressing room” (the contrary is true according to Scholes, who says Pogba should either tell his agent to shut up or sack him. Oh look, here’s the first email on what is sure to be a recurring theme: “It’s a huge night for Manchester United so Paul Pogba starts in his best position,” blurts S Wrap. “The bench.”Keep it solid and pounce on the counter-attack: that seems to be the unsurprising strategy put forward by Solskjaer, if his team selection is anything to go by. Luke Shaw returns to first-team action after injury, while there will be a rotating cast of attackers, with Rashford and Greenwood presumably flitting where the see fit. Leipzig will probably aim to be more dominant but they’ll be aiming to unhinge with fast and clever movement too. This promises to be entertaining.Hello. It’s another moment of truth for Manchester United: today we discover whether they are pitiable, rudderless drifters or a re-emerging force - at least until the next make-or-break day in Ole Gunanr Solskjaer’s up-and-down reign. Harry Maguire cited last season’s Top Four Decider at Leicester as evidence of his team’s ability to show their class when it matters most, but three semi-final defeats in the same season stand as exhibits to the contrary. Still, that’s the past: what we’re dealing with today is a Champions League nail-biter in which a draw or a win will confirm United’s progress from an exceptionally difficult group and defeat would lead to Europa League indignity and an avalanche of abuse for Solskjaer (andor Maguire, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw, David De Gea, the suspended Fred and, oh yes, Paul Pogba).United have reason to be optimistic. They tend to be particularly dangerous away from home thanks to their awesome counter-attacking power and, what is more, they whacked Leipzig 5-0 at Old Trafford in October, when the usually excellent Dayot Upamecano turned in a performance that rather discredited all those stories linking him with a future move to Old Trafford. But Leipzig have beaten PSG at home since then and came tantalisingly close to climbing to the top of the Bundesliga last weekend before conceding a late equaliser to draw 3-3 with Bayern Munich. United’s bad-first-halfbarnstorming-second-half routine might just prove to be enough today. But it might not. Either way, stuff’s about to go down. This could turn out to be an epic contest that will make future editions of the brilliant Untied Rewind podcast even better, or it it could be a total dud – with baleful consequences. All in all, it’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60f0a570f3f4d41f268db44c4435b4c9d46bbfe5/96_1191_885_530/master/885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c05362d3533c4ec43a51e6fccfa6c41","title":"david squires on the booing of footballers taking a knee","story":"Our cartoonist on demoralising scenes at Millwall, angry old white men and unlikely Marxism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79b57f5ed3b8c77c33937a9cc8b361899c7b77e1/0_11_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=936835f60db1128cca2a562e29c4e96e","title":"teaching dogs to talk stella bunny","story":"Provided with a board full of buttons, some pets appear to be communicating with their humans – and researchers are investigatingThere are plenty of reasons why we talk to our pets. Some research suggests our chattiness can be motivated by loneliness, a need to feel control over the dynamic of our relationship with them, or even just our perception of animal consciousness. It’s likely that most pet owners would simply feel weird not greeting their wagging pup at the door with a shower of “oh, hellooo”s or cooing baby-talk to their purring cat.What’s altogether unexpected is the idea that pets might talk to us – but new research is exploring whether and how they can.Helmed by Dr Federico Rossano, director of the Comparative Cognition Lab at the University of California San Diego, and Leo Trottier, a PhD candidate, project They Can Talk is one of the latest in a decades-long series of psycholinguistic studies seeking to document non-humans expressing themselves in language-like ways. But unlike many studies of the past, which either focused on the learning capacity of a single star animal – like Koko the gorilla, Kanzi the chimpanzee, or Rico the dog – They Can Talk is an unusually large, open-source citizen science study.More than 1,000 dogs, 50 cats and a few horses are involved in the project – with more applicants every day.Yet there would be no They Can Talk at all if there was not first the work of Christina Hunger, a San Diego speech-language pathologist who began training Stella, her Catahoulablue heeler mix, as a puppy in 2018.Inspired by the behavioral similarities she perceived between Stella and preverbal toddlers, she ordered a box of four recordable buttons and started off with a few of them each programmed to say a different word. “My initial intention was just to teach her a few words to express some basic needs to help us communicate a bit better, but we just kept progressing,” Hunger says.Today, Stella can use her expanded button set-up – itself a kind of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device not unlike those used by humans with language problems – to seemingly convey concepts with combinations of up to five words at a time.When Trottier came across Hunger and Stella on Instagram in 2019, he had already spent years studying cognitive science and developing tech to monitor animal behavior. He quickly realized he could make a prefab pet AAC soundboard anyone could use, and that gaining systematic insight into whether and how animals use language-like communication could be easier than scientists had previously gauged.“I saw Christina doing what she was doing with buttons, and it became clear what we thought would take reams and reams of data and probably a decade or more, as well as a large team of software developers, could actually be done in a fraction of the time with people who are familiar with techniques of speech-language pathology and a bunch of talk buttons that make sounds,” he says.Trottier and Rossano launched the They Can Talk pilot program in March of this year. The researchers found an initial group of 50 – “a lot of teachers, a lot of speech-language pathologists, a lot of dog trainers”, says Trottier – willing to kickstart the project from home by recording their dogs’ interactions with a soundboard of programmable AAC “HexTiles” Trottier designed and now sells through his company, CleverPet. (Hunger, who will release a book of her own work next spring, did not join.)Two of these pilot participants were Tacoma’s Alexis Devine and her sheepadoodle, Bunny. Bunny, who has been using some form of recordable buttons to express herself since Devine brought her home in 2019, is now a bit of an internet celebrity.Since Devine began posting Bunny’s adventures in communication on TikTok in May, her account @What_About_Bunny has amassed 5.3 million followers who love watching Bunny seemingly request afternoon walks by pressing “now”, “afternoon”, or “walk”, or observe the audible ocean waves outside her house by pawing the buttons “water” and “sound”.Bunny’s TikTok popularity supercharged public interest in project They Can Talk, sending heaps of eager new applicants – many of them bored at home during the pandemic and spending loads of time with their pets anyway.By engaging with concepts of time and space, Bunny is also a good representative of what researchers hope to see: pets who are able to go beyond first-order associations, demanding, for example, food or attention, and who rather suggest the capacity for things like syntax and conceptual contextualization. The reason it’s important that Bunny, or any other pet, may be able to refer to things that happened last week is that it counters “the long philosophical and psychological tradition which claims that only humans have certain cognitive abilities that are related to language”, such as episodic memory, explains Rossano.Additionally, Rossano notes that scientists currently believe humans are the only species to use language to convey our emotional experiences to others. By pointing out things that interest her, such as the waves, Bunny seems to be acting much like a human toddler, sharing something that has caught her attention.If animals can truly and reliably use language to place themselves in time and share their emotions, “then already it changes our representation of the emotional, mental life of other creatures, which can of course affect our very assumptions of these animals and how we treat them, how we interact with them, and what kinds of rights we give them”, says Rossano.Critics of the project have noted the issue of confirmation bias: we, as enthusiastically anthropomorphizing humans, long to read into animal behavior and see an intellectual complexity comparable to our own. Perhaps that’s all that is going on when we watch a dog like Bunny.Rossano emphasizes that no dog or other animal should be forced or coerced with food to engage with AAC soundboards. Domestic animals, he notes, have their own fundamental way of relating to humans and each other, and project They Can Talk neither can nor should replace that.“What I’m hoping is, at the very least, participants will get to spend more time with their animal and interact with them, and that itself should be a good thing,” says Rossano. “If the animal doesn’t learn to use the buttons, it doesn’t matter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da35191d1b312eddebfc1acc4b7816ea766535a/549_523_6041_3624/master/6041.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50c857e21a05d6fbd3d7062e8176b554","title":"youve frozen how to use tech to keep in touch over christmas","story":"If your family can’t gather, or you’ve decided not to risk it, how can you bring your loved ones together? Here’s a guide to all the kit you need, and how to set it up …The holidays are going to be different this year. Three households may be more than we’ve crammed into the same room for months, but for most of us it’s a far cry from our whole family. And even if you can fit everyone you care about in the same limited gathering, you may have reasonable doubts about whether you want to take the risk that comes with it.So it’s time to start preparing for alternatives. We may be Zoomed out, but with a little extra effort, even a remote gathering can feel special and fun.We’ve been doing this dance for almost nine months now, so you know the score: Zoom is technologically reliable, Google Meet doesn’t require anyone to install software, FaceTime is easiest to use if everyone involved is on Apple devices, and so on.Zoom’s 40-minute limit on free accounts could put some off, but there’s a chance the company will repeat the giveaway it announced for the US Thanksgiving weekend and remove that cap for a few days either side of Christmas. If not, best to steer clear unless someone in your family can piggyback on a work account (provided their employer doesn’t see an issue with that).Chances are you don’t want to sit at a desk for your family gathering, so it’s time to get things set up in the living room. If any household has a streaming box that supports screen sharing, such as a Chromecast or an Apple TV, then you’re in luck: load up your voice chat service of choice, share the screen to your TV, and place the phone or camera close enough that you can look your family in the eye but far enough away to avoid feedback.If you don’t have that hardware, don’t panic. Instead, the easiest thing to do is simply to plug your computer or phone into your TV directly, using an HDMI cable and, if necessary, an adapter for either your iPhone or your Android device that lets you plug it into your phone or laptop. Then just get the video chat software running on as normal and it should be easily visible on the big screen as well.Many of us will be celebrating with multiple people in the room. But if you’re on your own, and you have a comfortable pair of headphones to wear while chatting to your family, doing so can smooth things over for everyone.In order to avoid screeching feedback, most video-chat services mute the microphone while someone else is speaking, which is why some conversations end up with everyone hearing snippets of what other people are saying. But if you wear headphones, you avoid that problem. Even if you’re the only person on the chat wearing them, it can make things easier for everyone.You’re probably not going to be able to – or want to – cook four different turkeys in four different houses and all sit down at the same time. But it can improve the sense of community if you have some shared snacks planned beforehand.That could be as simple as all agreeing on the nibbles you’ll prepare (you probably even have some Christmas traditions already, after all), or as complex as each ordering in the same cheese plate or beer selection so you have something to talk about while the kids are playing with their new toys.It wouldn’t be Christmas without some family games. The good news is, it’s just as easy to play charades over a webcam as it is in person (it even works if the audio’s a bit choppy), and no one’s going to be that sad if they have to pass up on Monopoly for a year. But, thanks to the pandemic, there are also a load of great party games available in simple online implementations. Just get everyone to load up the same site on their phones – ideally one each – and you can replace the cards, boards and pieces which you would normally use.At the website Netgames.io you can play party games including Codenames, Spyfall and One Night Werewolf without needing to register or sign up, while more traditional Christmas games such as Uno (play.unofreak) or, yes, Monopoly (webopoly.org) are also available elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eee21f8396353f177d4b7d8bfe8059d885cd98a7/0_170_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc5d1c771153b16ec8d9edd3ba8bb46c","title":"how to have a covid safe christmas","story":"Families across the UK are being allowed to gather over Christmas, even as tens of thousands of new coronavirus cases are recorded each day.

Normally it’s Matt Hancock who gets all the crap gigs and is No 10’s “designated fall-guy”. But while all Boris Johnson got from his hospital visit to observe one of the first vaccinations – soon every jabbee will be issued with an “I don’t want to be used as a photo op for politicians” sticker – was a whole load of questions on the Brexit negotiations that he couldn’t deal with, Hancock was allowed to bask in his moment of glory. A saviour had risen from the streets and to everyone’s surprise – not least Matt’s – that person was him. Even if it was only for one day.Hancock’s day had begun with a puzzle. Had he or had he not cried on ITV’s Good Morning Britain when watching footage of William Shakespeare of the Stratford-on-Avon area (really) receive his coronavirus jab? Matt certainly appeared tearful, but not everyone was completely convinced. Still, it made good telly.He had said how emotional it was, had lowered his face as he rubbed his eyes and yet it was hard to spot a genuine tear. Perhaps it was just old fashioned British reserve or maybe all his tears had been used up on the 60,000 people who had already died from coronavirus – many of them in care homes as a direct result of his department’s neglect. “It makes me proud to be British,” he said, his voice catching a little, as he conveniently forgot that the vaccine had been made by a German biotech firm working in collaboration with a US pharmaceutical giant.Certainly by the time the health secretary arrived in the Commons at lunchtime to answer an urgent question on the vaccine’s distribution, he appeared to have recovered his composure. This was to be his moment and he was determined to enjoy every second. So often he has been called on to explain why the government’s response to the coronavirus has been at best hopeless and at worst reckless, but now he was just happy to be festooned with garlands from both sides of the house. This year has been unremittingly grim and MPs from all parties were just glad to have some good news to share with one another. Many seemed rather more emotional than Hancock had on telly earlier in the day.Matt didn’t actually have much to say, beyond repeating what he had said on his broadcast rounds. It was a historic day but we should not get too carried away as the NHS faced a herculean task in introducing the vaccination programme across the country. So far the vaccines were restricted to 70 hub hospitals but he expected other hospitals and care homes to receive supplies by next week. But we were still in for a long haul and if we were to get through it then people should abide by the rules. For some reason, he omitted to say that one way of helping might be to scrap the five-day Christmas free-for-all which was sure to add to the death toll in January and February.By and large – the major screw-ups excepted – the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, has tried to adopt an approach of constructive criticism in his responses to Hancock’s coronavirus statements. Today he just went for the full love-in. This was a great day and he wasn’t going to spoil it with any niggle. So all he wanted to know was whether all care homes would get the vaccine by Christmas – spoiler alert: they probably won’t as we don’t have enough stock and can’t be certain when the next batches will arrive – and whether junior NHS staff would qualify as priority recipients.Hancock successfully managed to answer completely different questions while repeating that it had been an emotional day. Jeremy Hunt, chair of the health select committee, then asked the question that was literally on no one’s mind. Was it now safe for everyone to book their summer holidays? He’d got a great deal on a villa in the Seychelles but he’d like the health secretary to give him the nod before putting down a deposit. Hancock merely said he’d already sorted his own holiday in Cornwall. Or failing that, the Isle of Wight. Anywhere in tier 1 basically.Most of the rest of the questions were just as soft. If not quite so random. Everyone welcomed the vaccine but wanted to know when it was coming to a hospital near their constituencies and, while they had the health secretary’s unided attention, would he consider moving their region down a tier next week in celebration. Matt merely smiled benignly, assured everyone he had the logistics under control and that he would do what he could when the time was right. He even managed to rein back the jingoistic rhetoric of the UK’s place in world history as the first country to administer the vaccine. Though he did mention it twice.There were just a few MPs who dared raise some of the trickier questions. Like why was track and trace still such a disaster when it was going to be key to protecting the nation’s health in the coming months before the rollout was complete. And what were the contingency plans for bringing the vaccine into the country if there were delays at the border caused by Brexit?“We have five contingency plans,” Hancock insisted. Well, could you let us know what they were, asked Labour’s Emma Lewell-Buck. Matt couldn’t. This level of information was top secret and he’d have to kill her if he told her. Which was odd, as Hancock had already told the country what they were during his media round earlier in the day. Lorries, boats, a variety of ports, commercial aircraft and, if all else failed, the RAF. Still, maybe Hancock could be forgiven for this lapse in memory. As he had said on several occasions, it had been an emotional day. Even the losers get lucky sometimes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/432615e4253e411592b3db9a1864492de280c0b4/0_186_4643_2785/master/4643.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6a7080593f5d5ffcffef345483ff15ea","title":"uk coronavirus live hancock covid rules tier 2 3 vaccine brexit latest updates","story":"Latest updates: Boris Johnson to meet Ursula von der Leyen for dinner in Brussels Michel Barnier says no-deal more likely than a dealThat’s all from us for today. For a detailed summary of an eventful day for Brexit, see 6.06pm. Meanwhile, for those who want to follow our coverage of the latest coronavirus updates from around the world, head over to our global liveblog, here:And here is our story on the news that Britain’s future relationship with the EU hangs on Boris Johnson’s dinner with Ursula von der Leyen tomorrow, which comes after Michel Barnier said the chance of a deal being struck is “very slim”.If you’re struggling to keep up, the ’s Brussels chief Daniel Boffey has compiled a who’s who and analysis of the key players charged with breaking the Brexit impasse at tomorrow’s make-or-break summit.The former Tory chancellor George Osborne and self-proclaimed “political casualty of the Brexit wars”, who campaigned for Remain alongside the then prime minister David Cameron, has penned a comment piece in the Evening Standard. He writes that Britain will find its “splendid isolation is an illusion” and will “likely end up ‘voluntarily’ shadowing the EU rules and standards that we once helped shape”.Here is are some extracts: Each step Britain has taken in the post referendum world has been in the direction of a hard Brexit. We now face a rupture with our closest neighbours that only a small minority of a small majority would have supported back in 2016. We’re out of the single market that Margaret Thatcher pioneered out of the customs union too, with 50,000 new customs officers and lorry parks in Kent to show for it. None of that was inevitable four years ago — indeed many of the most prominent supporters of Brexit said the reverse. Yes, if there’s a last-minute deal there will be no tariffs on manufactured goods — but there is no trade agreement at all on the services industries like finance that make up 80 per cent of the UK economy. Like a frog, if we had been thrown straight into the hot water back then, we would have jumped out — or perhaps never jumped in. But slowly, via internal Tory battles and Labour miscalculations, leadership changes and elections, we’ve reached a world where January 1, 2021 will mark the largest act of protectionism in our history. The country is too exhausted to care. “Any deal will be a tradeoff between wealth and sovereignty – the proportion and timescale are the only considerations,” writes  columnist Rafael Behr. There is one Brexit deal. There has only ever been one. It has been there from the start, although hard to see through the fog. Its outline has been discernible behind plumes of rhetoric and misinformation billowing out from the Westminster political machine. It was there on the horizon the morning after the referendum. It has not moved during the thousands of hours of debate that followed.The deal was already contained in article 50. It was in every bill in every late-night Commons vote. It was in Theresa May’s backstop and Boris Johnson’s alternative. It is the hard kernel of a soft Brexit and the soft underbelly of a hard one. It is the capital of Norwegian, Canadian and Australian-style Brexits. It is this: the UK will give up wealth in exchange for sovereignty.In what proportions and over what timescale is the only real subject of negotiation. Whether that exchange should be made at all is the essential difference between leavers and remainers. The scenario we now call “no deal” is a way of describing the highest price for the largest portion of sovereignty. The treaty that Johnson might agree in an 11th hour trip to Brussels describes a different transaction using the same formula.Read the full column here:And from the ’s Harry Yorke via RTE’s Tony ConnellyHere is Gove telling Sky News there will be “a small number of proportionate checks” on food products going into Northern Ireland that will be “as light-touch as possible”.

(see 5.09pm.)But both sides set the stage for a potentially make-or-break meal in Belgium on Wednesday.Earlier in the day, the cabinet office minister Michael Gove and his counterpart on the UK-EU joint committee, Maros Sefcovic, reached an agreement on border checks and trading rules for Northern Ireland.Their discussions are separate from the trade talks, which remain deadlocked, but the agreement could improve relations between the two negotiating teams.Ministers enraged the EU by requesting the powers to breach international law in overriding parts of the EU in the UK internal market bill, arguing it was needed to protect the trading relationship between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the event of no-deal.But Gove and Sefcovic said in a statement that “an agreement in principle” had been reached on all issues and that the government would withdraw the controversial clauses of the bill. They said:Following intensive and constructive work over the past weeks by the EU and the UK, the two co-chairs can now announce their agreement in principle on all issues, in particular with regard to the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.The agreement covers issues including border checks on animal and plant products, the supply of medicines and deliveries of chilled meats and other food products to supermarkets.There was also “clarification” on the application of rules on state subsidies.Sefcovic said he hoped the agreement would provide “positive momentum” for the trade talks, although he acknowledged the two sides were still “very far apart”.It comes after the prime minister said trade talks with the bloc were proving “very tricky” and that it was “very, very difficult” to make progress, but that he was hopeful about reaching a deal.From the UK’s chief negotiator for the talks on the future relationship with the EU and Boris Johnson’s Europe adviser, David FrostThis is from Liesje Schreinemacher, a Dutch politician and member of the European parliamentThat’s all from me.

The UK government has updated its coronavirus dashboard. Here are the key figures.Scotland’s education secretary has announced the cancellation of next year’s higher and advanced higher exams, despite previous insistence that they should go ahead.John Swinney made the announcement after growing concerns that many pupils – in particular those of poorer backgrounds - have missed out on schooling as a result of repeated self-isolation. He said the “differential disruption to education caused by periods of self-isolation” had been “fundamental” to his decision-making.He insisted that pupils’ grades “will be anchored in teacher assessment” and that teachers will have “months more” to familiarise themselves with the judgments they need to make, based on classroom work throughout the year.In October, Swinney announced the cancellation of National 5s – the equivalent of English and Welsh GCSEs – next year.He also announced that university students would face a six-week staggered return to campus at the beginning of next year, with undergraduates restarting their studies at home, at the normal beginning of term, and only returning to campus and their term-time accommodation when asked to do so by their university."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d989e30b99fb05e8d6a92b442281b596fec72d/0_130_4000_2402/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d7b87b571aa4f382fec02ea8c6c2b964","title":"ndidi okezie covid has decimated services for vulnerable young people","story":"The chief executive of UK Youth on how the sector is struggling to survive the funding crisis caused by the pandemic• Please donate to the  and Observer charity appeal here What happens to the most vulnerable children when they are not at school? With figures from the National Education Union showing 900,000 pupils absent owing to “Covid incidents”, it’s a question we as a society have a duty to answer, insists Ndidi Okezie, the chief executive of the charity UK Youth.“When young people are not at school and can’t be at home, it is youth work provision that scoops them up but now that sector is on its knees,” she explains.The 41-year-old ex-teacher says it was her “dream job” when she became chief executive of UK Youth in January. The charity champions investment in the youth sector and supports 7,000 youth organisations across Britain, and is one of the recipients of the  and Observer’s charity appeal 2020.The charity’s outdoor learning centre in the New Forest, Avon Tyrrell, had to close – losing UK Youth £2m of income. Okezie recalls: “It was heartbreaking. We didn’t know whether it would be back.” It will be next year. The charity, which has an annual income of £6m, works with 100,000 young people a year, and was suddenly under threat at the time it was needed most. “With every single issue that has come out of Covid-19, young people are one of the most impacted groups, be it employment, mental health or digital exclusion,” says Okezie.School closures have left children and teenagers vulnerable to unsafe home environments, physical abuse, self-harm and drug use.“We are dealing with generations of young people whose every prior need has been exacerbated by the pandemic and the most vulnerable are hit hardest.“Youth organisations have been picking up the pieces but the very real concern is the sector has been decimated and as we look towards coming out of the crisis there may not be a sector there in the same way for young people.”Although the £16.5m in this month’s spending review for a youth Covid-19 support fund is welcome, Okezie says: “It’s not enough and it’s not even going to touch the sides.”Meanwhile a government pledge of £500m in transformational funding for the youth sector has been delayed because of the pandemic. Okezie was among those to sign an open letter warning that youth services are on the brink of collapse. They point to new figures which suggest two out of three youth charities will not be able to meet costs by March 2020 and one in four are unable to meet their running costs before Christmas.UK Youth has funded 265 projects so far this year. By the end of 2020 it will have allocated £3m in micro-grants to grassroots youth organisations. This includes a £2m UK Youth Fund – Covid Relief made up of contributions from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the Pears Foundation and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, which it distributes to eligible small, local youth organisations. According to Okezie, more than 1,800 organisations applied for the funding, although it is far short of the £15m these charities and voluntary organisations say they need to survive in research undertaken by UK Youth. Following the death of George Floyd and the subsequent Black Lives Matter protests this year, Okezie invited staff to talk about their experiences. Out of that conversation came the idea to give young people a platform to share their stories.“Suddenly there was this huge spotlight on race and UK Youth really leaned into this – it was incredibly emotional and problematic and it was one of those moments where I thought, wait, I can do something, I’ve got agency, I’m the CEO.”The charity launched the campaign #YoungAndBlack to highlight the experiences of black people in Britain and encourage them to amplify their voices on social media. More than 300 organisations signed up to support the campaign.At the same time, a report, Home Truths, published in June by Acevo and Voice4Change, found that more than two-thirds of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people working in the voluntary sector had experienced, witnessed or heard stories of racism.The findings, which Okezie described as a “disaster”, led UK Youth and other charities to sign a commitment to dismantling racism within the voluntary sector.When she took on this job, she says that she wasn’t prepared for the “tsunami of attention” that came with her appointment.“People were emotional about the fact there was a black woman CEO in the charity sector in a way I had not expected. It was important to them to have someone in this position that looked like them. Because of that I realise I’m not here only to do the job but to create actual systemic change so I’m not just an outlier.”Born in Nigeria, the youngest of six children, Okezie came to the UK with her mother as a baby.“There is no rhyme or reason for me to be here in this position. There is nothing about my life that said I’d be here,” she says. “The fact I am the ‘only’ in many environments I walk into bears an additional weight. I feel I need to make a difference otherwise why take up the seat?”Her biggest fear is we don’t yet fully understand the long-term impact of Covid-19 on young people. But describing today’s youth as “the lost generation” she finds unhelpful.“People are using this flippant language but young people haven’t gone anywhere. Where are they and what is happening to them now? We have a responsibility to answer that,” she says.“We are only just starting to pick up the pieces and to make sure we have a net to catch them with on the other side.”Career: 2020-present: CEO, UK Youth 2019: vice-president: secondary portfolio UK schools (interim), Pearson 2018-19: digital and customer voice strategy, Pearson 2012-18: executive director, Teach First 2006-13: assistant principal, Burlington Danes academy 2004-06: head of department, Business Academy Bexley 2003-2005: trainee teacher, Teach First."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdb554657d76c9f1f6bb7c9532f6309927c2aa67/0_290_6412_3848/master/6412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be6a264dc64f8104e15709a2d92fb2b4","title":"alix popham interview rugby union dementia special report","story":"The former Wales back-rower was diagnosed with early onset dementia this year aged 40 and is frustrated the game he still loves – despite what it has done to him – has not been made saferAlix Popham calls it D-day. “We were in the middle of bloody lockdown, couldn’t go anywhere, couldn’t see anybody.” So he was at home with his wife, Mel. And the phone rang. “They told us to sit down and then they said: ‘Sorry, it’s not good news.’”At the age of 40, Popham had been diagnosed with early onset dementia and probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy (“probable” because the diagnosis can be confirmed only by a post-mortem). He was surprised to find he felt relieved “because I wasn’t going mad. It wasn’t all in my head. I wasn’t making things up.” Later he felt anger, too, anger that the game he loves, and had given his life to, had, it seems, led to this.They showed his last Test match on TV during lockdown, Wales against England at Twickenham in 2008, the first match of the famous grand slam. He watched it with Mel and their three kids. He knows he played in it, that Wales won, but not much more. “I’ve got no recollection of being in the game, I can’t remember being on the bus, being in the stadium.”A lot of his career is like that. “My memories of rugby are made-up, from people telling me things or seeing pictures or watching clips.” He can remember stuff from when he was a kid “but lots of my career I just know I played for these clubs at that time, but I can’t remember a lot else about it”.He knows he met Nelson Mandela before a Test against South Africa in 2003, but only because he has a photo of it. He was knocked out cold during the game and only woke up after the match. His neuropsychologist told him his brain must have been so inflamed it was as if “he had the camera but there was no film in it”.Last year, the problems started to seep into his everyday life. Little things at first, stuff he could shrug off. His wife would send him out to buy milk, but when he got to the shop he’d forgotten what she wanted, or she would send him to get cash from her bank account and he would forget her pin. He would find it hard to concentrate when more than one person was talking, couldn’t tune into a conversation if the TV was on in the background. And he found he was becoming unusually snappy and aggressive. He would slam doors when they rowed, once he even tore off the bannister. And then he would feel guilty. “I would think to myself: ‘What the fuck was all that about?’” Often, the next day, he couldn’t remember what the row was about. He felt a lot of anxiety, too, which he wasn’t used to. All of a sudden he was checking his emails over 10 times or more before he pressed send.Mel wanted him to see a doctor. He told her not to worry, that it was just he was feeling stress. Then he had the blackout. He was out on a bike ride, a 25-mile loop he had done countless times. Halfway round, he had no idea where he was. He stopped, sat on the side of the road, called home, and Mel told him to cycle back the way he came. The next day he made an appointment to see his GP. It was the first of many, in the NHS and then in private care. There were MRI scans, DTI scans, meetings with doctors, neurologists and neuropsychologists. Then D-day. And suddenly, it all started to make sense.As ever with the brain, there is much we cannot know for sure. These diagnoses are a deeply unsettling development in players so young. The gathering of what science likes to call “hard data” takes many years and many studies, which is small comfort to those living with any repercussions in the here and now. It was not until 2019 that science established a raised incidence of mortality by neurodegenerative disease among professional footballers of the 20th century. Rugby is likely looking at a stronger association. Most players, we must hope, will be unaffected. The reality is we will start to find out only as they age. And, even then, is any risk simply a function of playing the sport or of other factors?Rugby is 150 years old. Why is this a problem now?If these cases of dementia are symptomatic of a new phenomenon, the key development appears to be when elite rugby players went full-time in the 1990s. Not only did the physical toll of the 80 minutes intensify dramatically, players were subjected to contact training throughout the week. A group of players intend to pursue a legal case against the rugby authorities claiming they were owed a duty of care given emerging evidence of the dangers.Yes. Training is much more sophisticated than in the wild west of the early years of the professional era. Awareness and treatment of head injury has also been transformed in the last decade. Alas, with better preparation of players, the intensity of the 80 minutes on the field has continued to escalate. There is no way of knowing if the net effect of this relative shift in load from the week to the weekend mitigates the risks.What can rugby do?This is probablyhopefully a problem restricted to the elite game, where the attrition rates are so much higher. Certain measures are already in place since the Thompson generation played. Head injury must be managed ever more carefully. Science is on the cusp of developing technologies to detect brain injury more effectively and swiftly, but this could be a double-edged sword if it goes on to reveal a much higher incidence than previously thought. Current attempts to change the nature of the game are likely to prove hopelessly peripheral. There is no easy answer to that.He still has regular appointments with a neuropsychologist and an occupational therapist. They have been helping the family learn how to live the best lives they can. Mel was staying overnight in London one day a week for her work, but one night when she was away he forgot the grill was on and started a fire in the kitchen. So she decided it was best to stay at home. They make sure they are always in the same room when they need to talk. He has a diary of things he needs to do each day, half hour by half hour. And he has given up alcohol and started learning techniques to help him deal with his stress and anxiety. He wonders how different it all might be if he knew then what he knows now. “But in our day it was sniffing salts and shrug it off.”It’s not only the concussions he is worried about, it’s all the blows. His consultant asked him to make a rough count of the tackles, carries and clean-outs he made in every game and training session. “He thinks minimum I’ve had over 100,000 sub-concussions. Minimum. And that’s just my professional career. I started playing when I was four.” One of his neurologists explained it like this: “Every contact causes a little bit of damage to your brain. Look at it like a leaking tap. If it drips once or twice on a piece of mud there’d be no mark, but if it drips for 14 years there would be a lot of damage. And there is a lot of damage showing on my scans.”However despite it all, he still loves rugby. “All my life, every day since I was four, it’s been rugby, rugby, rugby. And there’s so many amazing things that you get from it.” But he’s angry it is not safer, angry there are people playing now who may end up in the same position he is in. He rattles off three changes he believes the authorities could make tomorrow. The first is to provide each player with a mandatory health check every year, including brain scans. The second is to improve insurance provision after retirement. The third is to limit contact training, which the NFL started doing nine years ago. “Why would they think it’s not going to happen in rugby, when the NFL put that in place in 2011?”“How I look at life is this: if somebody is having a kicking on the side of the street I would pull over and try and stop what was going on. And I’m frustrated at the moment with what’s happening, because it feels like the governing bodies are driving past that person being beaten up. Because they know what the problems are, and they can so easily solve so many of them.” There still are going to be concussions, he says, and freak accidents, because it is a contact sport. Like a lot of former players, Popham carries scars from playing it. His upper body is “buggered”, but he always knew that was the risk. “You know you are signing up for that. Same for all the guys I’ve spoken to. We knew our bodies were going to be in bits when we retired. But we had no clue our brains were as well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d2d8e5410ad2c434dfcf12ddf65937c3acca77f/116_510_4219_2532/master/4219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7d0156d2df8fc36d5251cd5f7cfcfe2","title":"early review levy system hands funding boost racing","story":"• Review brought forward by three years to 2021• Key step in Covid-19 Recovery Plan to restore stability The British Horseracing Authority hailed what could be a major boost to the sport’s long-term funding on Tuesday evening after the government announced it will review the Levy system, which returns money to racing from off-course betting, in 2021, three years ahead of schedule.An early review of the system, including a possible extension of Levy payments to cover races overseas, was a key step in the industry’s Covid-19 Recovery Plan, which was published in August. The plan aims to restore stability to racing’s income following huge losses in revenue due to the absence of significant crowds from British tracks since mid-March.Jockey Club Racecourses alone, which owns major venues including Cheltenham, Aintree, Epsom and Newmarket, is estimated to have lost at least £100m in revenue so far in 2020, while the overall loss to the industry has been estimated at £300m by the Racecourse Association. It could also be several months at least before attendances can return to anything like pre-Covid levels.The Levy review could also examine the possibility of returning to at least some element of turnover-based assessment of payments, rather than the current system based wholly on bookmakers’ gross profits from racing bets.Rust also welcomed Tuesday’s publication of the terms of a long-awaited review by the DCMS of the 2005 Gambling Act. “Betting on horse racing is enjoyed by millions of people safely and responsibly, with a low prevalence for gambling-related harm,” he said. “Despite the low levels of problem gambling in the sport, racing promotes responsible gambling and is committed to working with the betting industry to further reduce risk. We are pleased to hear that the review will be evidence-based and we look forward to proposals that are proportionate and focused on those at risk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b5bb10a8a49e4c14897942b493e2b8e6f9b605/76_322_2924_1756/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d43ce1b47ce43205eb5eede43af5de0f","title":"rugby union dark news dementia presents sport with reality dared not face","story":"Analysis: there is a clear link between rugby and dementia, and the key event appears to be the leap to professionalism in the 1990sIn other words, this is not a coincidence, and it is rugby’s problem. No amount of smooth-talking from the sport’s authorities, or platitudes about the need for further research, can controvert what is in plain sight. There is a link between rugby and degenerative neurological disorders. At this point, it must also be asserted that this association is probably with professional rugby, but there is likely to be a sliding scale, which could reach down into the ever-more punishing community game too.It seems the key event is the sudden leap to full-time professionalism of elite rugby union in the mid-1990s. A generation of players, now barely at middle age, thus became the first to play an entire career full-time. In so doing, they assumed a toll of physical attrition unlike that of any previous.Close enough to the amateur era and its unreconstructed ways, that period of early professionalism may even prove to have been exceptionally punishing, certainly in terms of the toll of training throughout the week. Clubs and unions are smarter now with their approach to preparation, but the intensity of the 80 minutes on matchday, fuelled by that ever-improving method, has continued to escalate and shows no signs of abating.Within the last decade, rugby has tried to put its house in order regarding concussion. The transformation in the culture surrounding head injury and the “old school” virtue of toughing it out has been swift, even impressive. But perhaps the most alarming possibility of all is that concussion, as defined variously each time experts in the worldwide Concussion in Sport Group meet, which is every four years, is at best only part of the problem.Such a conclusion would raise both codes of rugby into the highest risk category of the world’s major sports. The dramas that have played out in American football over the question of concussion have been watched with disquiet by rugby, but the suspicion the intensity of head collisions in the NFL is of a different order has allayed some of the fears. If the repetitive-blow hypothesis holds true, if the damage is a function of the number of impacts as well as the intensity, rugby suddenly becomes even more dangerous.There is no way of avoiding repetitive blows to the head, and lots of them, in rugby as currently played. Governing bodies can demand as many red cards as they see fit, or even implement actual law changes to lower the height of a legal tackle, but a sport with so many moving parts in a team, all commissioned to crash into each other at high speed, whether at tackle, ruck or set piece, cannot avoid the repetitive shaking of its players’ brains.The recent shift of the paradigm in football regarding headers offers no comfort, either. No one is knocked out by heading a football, but it seems increasingly likely there is a link there too between the bang-bang-bang of head with object and a raised incidence of neurological complications in later life.Rugby is now confronted with how early “later life” can be. For any of professionalism’s first generation to be diagnosed with dementia when barely into their 40s – and not even as old as that for some of the others with symptoms – is an ethical burden of immense weight for a sport to bear.All rugby players accept, as do those who play so many other sports, that there will be repercussions in later life for their bodies. But the progressive loss of their minds, the erosion of who they are, was never part of the bargain and certainly not within a few years of retirement.There is no way of knowing yet. Of course, any burden borne by what we must ardently hope is a small minority of the elite will be offset by the self-evident benefits that team sports confer across all of society, emotionally and culturally every bit as much as physically.But this is an uncomfortable bargain for a sport to strike. What is non-negotiable is the risks of a career in rugby are made clear to those considering one – and this must happen well before science, in its painstakingly meticulous manner, is able to declare definitively how the mechanics of these injuries work, a clear conception of which remains elusive. As long as players know, a sport’s conscience may remain clear.The trouble is, such transparency comes with a weighty burden of its own. To declare these risks is, effectively, to advertise them. The implications for a sport’s image among the wider population are dire. We are put in mind of smoking, an ever-vanishing pastime once embraced without a thought. We are put in mind of boxing.As society becomes cleaner, more health-conscious, more self-improving, so its tastes change. The great dilemma for a collision sport is that the cleaner, healthier and more improved its players become, the more dangerous they are to each other. No one has done any of this on purpose, but rugby’s paradox is no less ruinous for that – to itself or, it now seems certain, to at least some of the brains of its players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7641667265d9c71c29c954fb9868a0d94e8819cc/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=29981d018a5151f017a38328a5e42cec","title":"elon musk tesla california texas","story":"Billionaire, 49, confirms move to Wall Street Journal and says he plans to focus on new Tesla plant and SpaceX ventureElon Musk said on Tuesday he had relocated to Texas from California, where he plans to focus more on the new Tesla plant and his SpaceX venture.The billionaire confirmed the move in an interview with Matt Murray, the Wall Street Journal’s editor in chief.“The two biggest things that I got going on right now are the Starship development in south Texas … and then the big new US factory for Tesla,” the 49-year-old CEO said.Speaking at a Wall Street Journal summit, Musk also had some sharp words for his former home state. “If a team is winning for too long, they tend to get complacent,” Musk said, according to the Verge. “California has been winning for a long time, and I think they’re taking it for granted.”Texas might potentially offer some tax reprieve for the world’s second richest man.

My plan is to live like Moira, I’m going to start sleeping in brooches.Feet. I can’t watch anything with feet in. I haven’t seen a nice one in my life. I appreciate they have functions like balance and walking, but I don’t want to see them so I look away from the screen. I try to be subtle, though: I don’t want the kids to think I’m strange, or to take on my weirdness. I give my teenage boys a pedicure every Sunday – it’s my way of working through it.Antiques Roadshow. I watch it and get so frustrated with my parents: why didn’t they keep anything? We could have had something worth millions and bought a house with a swimming pool. But they didn’t, they only have tat. I think I hoard now because of that, so that what I hide away might go up in value. One day it’ll be me on the show trying to flog anything and everything, and people watching will think, briefly: do I recognise that woman?Diversity’s Black Lives Matter performance on this year’s Britain’s Got Talent. I’ll always remember it, and not because of all the Ofcom complaints. They did something so necessary, conveying a message that needed to be heard by everyone. I keep noticing my kids watching it back, it has just stuck in our heads. They did a wonderful thing, telling such an important story without saying a word.Friends. They were supposed to be filming again recently, and I think they need to get rid of Gunther and cast me to replace him. Let’s be honest, they could do with some ersity. If they need a thirtysomething Muslim woman from England to work at Central Perk, I am ready. I’ll even take acting lessons, although serving coffee and cake is kind of my thing. I’m putting it out there now, call me.The moment where I spoke about not putting boundaries on myself at the end of my series of Bake Off. It gets played to me a lot during interviews still, and even now I watch from behind my fingers and get emotional every time. People ask if it was a rehearsed speech – it wasn’t. I actually cried for 20 minutes straight before those words came out. It was one of the most real and poignant moments in my life, which happened to be caught on camera. I know when people watched it, it meant a lot to them, too: it was about so much more than just baking. It will stay with me forever.I got asked to do Strictly, but I said no. I love the idea, but have no rhythm and I enjoy watching it too much once you see how a programme works from the inside, it changes how you see it. That’s why I can’t watch Bake Off like I used to. I got asked to do I’m a Celebrity this year, and a bit of me regrets not doing it. It’s just so cold in Wales: if I’m going to have cockroaches in my pants I’d rather it be in the sun, thanks. Still, I can’t help wondering what it would have been like.Nadiya’s American Adventure airs at 8pm on Thursday, BBC One"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28c319ce3878359475755bf4df18ecc38a0fb1e1/0_44_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f5e89ab8f34804824f48f5b68096aaa","title":"are you getting the pfizer coronavirus vaccine this week in the uk","story":"We’d like to speak to people who are due to be given the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine in the coming daysThe Pfizer coronavirus vaccine is due to be rolled out in the UK this week, with the first people to receive doses on Tuesday.

That is a rise from 156 cases per 100,000the week before, with PHE noting the seven-day case rate for London increased over five consecutive days.In some parts of London, which is currently in tier 2, the latest figures show the rate was even higher, reaching 299 per 100,000 population in Barking and Dagenham and 319 in Havering, with a total of 20 of the 32 boroughs exceeding the average figure for England of 149 cases per 100,000.By contrast many areas already in tier 3 have lower rates, including the city of Bristol, where the rate is almost 141 per 100,000 population, and Coventry, where the rate is just over 134.“The latest data shows case rates are on the increase again in most London boroughs, including in the at-risk over 60s,” said Prof Kevin Fenton, the London regional director for Public Health England.“We’ll need to work together to prevent a big surge in cases in London ahead of the festive period so we must all do our bit and limit the spread over the coming days and weeks.”But Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for north-west England and author of Blinded by Corona, stressed that urgent action was needed.Experts say the trend in cases chimes with rises in the positivity rate and recent increases hospital admissions in London.Mike Gill, former regional director of public health for the south-east region, said the situation looks “very grim”. “I think it would be quite wrong to imagine that we can relax at Christmas without doing anything extra between now and then,” he told the . A review of coronavirus restrictions across the country is due to be carried out on 16 December.Prof Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a member of Independent Sage, agreed restrictions could be tightened.But Scally added that with Christmas rapidly approaching, and the government committed to relaxing restrictions for the festivities, the situation could get worse with expectations of a high movement of people, as well as international arrivals, multigenerational mixing and indoor gatherings – all of which can increase transmission.“I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the next week or two leaves the government with a really difficult conundrum just days before Christmas,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cbdef575791b22900a4c97a751d8af720d86f5c/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc9040581f5436344c229a2058e1d34","title":"students in the uk share your experiences of rapid testing coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear from students or parents on the mass rapid testing schemes taking place in universities before ChristmasSome experts have called for an end to the use of rapid tests in universities, where they have been rolled out to test students before they return home for Christmas.

In 2021, she will be responsible for overseeing vaccine distribution at the company’s nearly 10,000 US locations.Stacey Cunningham, the first woman to head the New York Stock Exchange, made the “swift” decision to shut down in-person trading as the virus was spreading in March, it said.The German chancellor Angela Merkel for a tenth consecutive year headed up the group of 100 women that also included leaders in entertainment, technology, philanthropy and finance from 30 countries.Other honourees included the US vice president-elect Kamala Harris and the UK’s Queen Elizabeth II.Martin Kenyon, 91, was outside Guy’s Hospital in London after getting the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine when he was chanced upon by CNN correspondent Cyril Vanier. Asked how it felt to be one of the first people in the world to receive the jab, Kenyon said:I don’t think I feel much at all, except that I hope that I’m not going to have the bloody bug now.During the interview, which went viral after being shared by CNN’s Omar Jimenez on Twitter, Kenyon added that he intended to hug his family for Christmas. “I’m going home to tell them now. Nobody knows. You’re the first to know,” he told Vanier.New confirmed coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours in France rose to 13,713 on Tuesday, up from 3,411 on Monday and 8,083 last Tuesday, health ministry data showed.On the 11th day after the government eased a nationwide lockdown, the number of people in intensive care however fell by 110 to 3,088, bringing it closer to a 2,500-3,000 government threshold that is one of the conditions for further lockdown easing.The French president Emmanuel Macron said last month that daily new infections need to fall to around 5,000 and the number of people in ICU to below 3,000 in order to lift the lockdown on 15 December. The number of cases now stands at 2.31 million.The ministry also reported that the number of people in hospital with the virus fell by 451 to 25,914, after reporting an increase the past two days.It also reported 831 new coronavirus deaths, including a four-day batch of 454 deaths in retirement homes and 377 deaths in hospitals. On Monday, it reported 366 deaths in hospitals.Canada is confident there will be no disruption of Covid-19 vaccine supplies even if the United States blocks their export because vaccines are manufactured in several countries, a minister said. This comes ahead of an expected US executive order meant to ensure Americans’ priority access to the shots.President Donald Trump’s executive order is intended to ensure priority access for Covid-19 vaccines procured by the US government, ahead of other nations, senior administration officials said on Monday.Asked about the impact of any executive order on those deliveries at a media briefing, a Canadian minister said Canada’s purchases are not tied to any one manufacturing site, and noted that Pfizer Inc is manufacturing in Europe as well as the United States.“We’re very confident that Pfizer and other vaccine makers that are contractually obligated to deliver vaccine doses to Canada will be able to meet those obligations,” said Dominic LeBlanc, minister of intergovernmental affairs.Mexico plans to begin vaccinating its people against Covid-19 at the end of the third week of December, starting with health workers, the government announced Tuesday.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the vaccines will be “universal and free” — and also voluntary — and he hopes the full population will be vaccinated by the end of 2021.Officials said that starting in February, those over 60 will receive vaccinations, followed by those over 50 in April and over 40 in May. They urged people with risk factors to get vaccinated first.The 67-year-old president himself said he would get vaccinated in February, along with his age group.The government already has contracted for 34.4 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and it said earlier that 250,000 of those are expected to arrive around 17 December.The armed forces will distribute them to vaccination sites, initially in Mexico City and the northern border state of Coahuila.Mexico has reported 1.18 million confirmed infections with the new coronavirus and at least 110,074 deaths from Covid-19, though both are acknowledged to be undercounts.Sam Foster, the chief nursing officer at Oxford’s acute hospital trust, administered the first doses of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine at the city’s Churchill hospital this morning. “I have been proud to play my part in delivering the first vaccinations on this historic day in our battle against the pandemic”, she said. Foster and a number of nurses who are experienced in vaccination together injected the vaccine into the shoulder of scores of people over 80, most of whom are outpatients, some care workers and also some NHS staff classed as high-risk because they have underlying health issues -- the first three priority groups to get the jabs. All the nurses involved are also “peer vaccinators” -- staff who usually administer the winter flu jab to colleagues in their area of care in a bid to encourage take-up. “As such they are not just skilled at administering vaccines but also at dealing with people’s anxieties and sensitivities”, a hospital source explained. Because the trust has only “limited supplies currently” of the vaccine, people from Oxfordshire, West Berkshire and Buckinghamshire wanting to be immunised should not ring their GP or the hospital and should instead wait for the NHS to contact them, Foster stressed. “This is a hugely significant moment in our pandemic response and offers hope at what has been a incredibly difficult year for us all”, said Dr Bruno Holtof (corr), the chief executive of Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Churchill. “The strict approval process it has gone through means that the approved vaccine, and any other vaccines approved in the future, will not only be safe but will be our best defence against the virus”, Holtof added. The trust chose the Churchill rather than its main hospital, the John Radcliffe Infirmary, as the location for its rollout of the vaccine because it is quieter than the JRI and has been kept Covid-free during the pandemic, because it is mainly a specialist cancer hospital. Staff have administered the jabs at what an official described as a carefully chosen “discreet part of the site” while people being immunised have reached there without going through the main hospital, again to promote social distancing. Everyone who receives their first dose is automatically booked in at the time for their second one three weeks later. Meanwhile, in Bristol, five staff from care home operators Brunelcare became some of the first social care staff in the country to have the vaccine. “The vaccine was quick and painless, and I’d encourage anyone who has the opportunity to get the vaccine to take it”, said Lesley Hobbs, the manager of the charity’s Deerhurst care home. She and her fellow workers were immunised at the city’s Southmead hospital 85 other colleagues are also booked in to have their first dose this week. Oona Goldsworthy, Brunelcare’s chief executive, hailed the vaccine as “the lifeline we’ve been waiting for in social care”. But, she added: “It is just the first step. We now await details of how and when the vaccine will be made available to our residents in our care homes”. Switzerland plans to ban all public events apart from church services and legislative meetings and further limit private gatherings after 12 December as infections swell.It is starting talks with the nation’s 26 cantons over the proposals, as it prepares for the new restrictions.The announcement came as the Federal Office of Public Health reported 92 more deaths, taking the death toll in Switzerland and neighbouring Liechtenstein to 5,116. The number of cases rose by 4,262 cases to 358,568, it said.The government also plans to order restaurants, shops and markets to close at 7pm through 20 January in an effort to restrict the spread of the virus. It also aims to restrict the number of people who could meet in households to five.“The number of new infections is high and is rising again, beds in intensive care units are stretched,” the government said. “The increasingly cold temperatures and bad weather may have accelerated the infection rate.”After getting feedback from the cantons, the Swiss government plans to meet again on Friday, ahead of a decision on the new measures due to start at the weekend.“The numbers are increasing exponentially - too quickly and too strongly. We want reduce contact and the number of infections,” Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga said.“If we don’t act quickly enough, the worst of the pandemic is still to come,” she added. “Then, even more drastic measures will be needed.”Deaths from Covid-19 in the US have soared to more than 2,200 a day on average, matching the frightening peak reached last April. Cases per day have eclipsed 200,000 on average for the first time on record, with the crisis all but certain to get worse because of the fallout from Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s.Virtually every state is reporting surges just as a vaccine appears days away from getting the go-ahead in the U.S.“The epidemic in the U.S. is punishing. It’s widespread. It’s quite frankly shocking to see one to two persons a minute die in the U.S. — a country with a wonderful, strong health system, amazing technological capacities,” said Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s chief of emergencies.The virus is blamed for more than 280,000 deaths and almost 15 million confirmed infections in the United States."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4409770.1605434900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"400 yes 400 irish retailers for all your online christmas shopping","story":"A number of Irish independent retailers describe how lockdowns and Covid restrictions have impacted their businesses - and what they’ve had to do to adapt. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish retailers are facing a tough Christmas with new Covid-19 restrictions closing non-essential outletsWe have been overwhelmed, in the best possible way, by the response to our original list, a few weeks ago, of 100 Irish websites where you can buy lovely, unique and good-value presents in the run-up to Christmas.Almost as soon as it appeared, business owners and many of their customers emailed us, tweeted us, sent us Instagram messages and contacted us on Facebook to champion more Irish companies doing the business online.That response matters, because we all know that the run-up to Christmas,\u0026nbspwith so many physical shops in lockdown,\u0026nbspis going to be incredibly hard for many businesses. It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe On the traditional day when rural dwellers flocked to the capital for their Christmas shopping, this year Dublin city centre was “certainly different”, Kay Mealy from Drogheda observes as she take a photo of the Arnott’s Christmas window.Ms Mealy and her husband are in town for an essential appointment and have just a couple of hours to browse the stores and soak up the festive atmosphere.“This is our first time down to Dublin during the Christmas period,” she says.Asked if she has done much online shopping this year, Ms Mealey shakes her head, smiling: “This is more or less the time to get it done,” she adds.Historically, December 8th was the date that marked the beginning of the Irish Christmas shopping rush and is a holy day that used to see most schools close.In recent years the day has been overtaken by online shopping trends such as Black Friday. And this year despite non-essential retail reopening after six weeks on December 1st, the restrictions on inter-county travel until December 18th have lessened the rural shopping rush to Dublin.Among those shoppers to make the journey is Margaret from Mullingar. She has most of her Christmas shopping finished by now but enjoyed spending December 8th “pottering around” Dublin’s bustling streets.She has travelled over for the day with two of her friends, as is their festive tradition, but it is pure coincidence that they have arrived on this holy day, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.“We come up to Dublin every year for a bit of shopping. Normally we would stay in a hotel with friends but not this year, obviously,” she says, adding that there is a “nice atmosphere” around Grafton Street.Margaret says she did most of her Christmas shopping online this year due to the pandemic. Today she is in search of a nice ring for herself to belatedly celebrate turning 60 last March.“I am treating myself… I don’t really have any shopping left to do so we are just up for the day to enjoy ourselves. We are just pottering around,” she says.Shortly before noon, Celine from Co Wicklow is bracing herself for the shops following morning mass in St Teresa’s Church just off Grafton Street.She admits that she and her friend “shouldn’t really be” in the capital, as public health restrictions stipulate inter-county travel is allowed only if a person has a “reasonable excuse”.“We are breaking the rules, but it’s quite quiet and we are wearing the masks and being careful,” she says, adding that they live “just over the border”. She missed Mass during the lockdowns and was grateful for the “little oasis of calm” on this holy day.“It’s nice at my age to get to it,” she says, adding that they travelled specially for the Mass. December 8th is not a day the pair particularly set aside for shopping, she adds.On Anne Street South, Deirdre O’Donnell contemporary jewellery store has benefitted from a rush of shoppers over the last week. December 8th has “not really been any busier today than normal, but we have had people from all over Ireland come in recently”, she says.Owner Deirdre O’Donnell’s third Christmas season at her current location, she says she has never noticed an increase in footfall on December 8th.However, since reopening for business one week ago her store has been “very busy,” she says.“We weren’t nervous about reopening because it was the second (lifting of) lockdown so we knew what to expect… The footfall has been on a par with last year,” she adds.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"More than 1,240 people engage with 90 TDs in online eventsState investment needed to capitalise on potential to make area a green energy industry leaderIndex puts Ireland 39th out of 57 countries, mainly due to its failure to cut emissions"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431208.1607462877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"holohan sets out ominous picture for january in letter to government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt is hard to see how public health officials will not seek a third lockdown in January given their extremely gloomy forecasts of recent days. Photograph: Getty imagesIt is hard to see how public health officials will not seek a third lockdown in January given their extremely gloomy forecasts of recent days.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, both in his letter to Government last week and his comments at the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing on Monday, clearly foresees daily case numbers after Christmas reaching the kind of level that twice previously triggered recommendations for swingeing restrictions.The euphoria surrounding the rollout of a Covid-19 vaccine in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is understandable. But for now, and many months to come, restrictions are the only way Government knows to rein in surging case numbers, when other public health measures have failed.In his letter Dr Holohan set out an ominous picture case numbers did not fall far enough after the last lockdown, they are already rising again, and Christmas is approaching with all the potentially risky socialising that entails.As a result Nphet is already revising its modelling forecast upwards. Previously it had forecast up to 1,200 cases a day by mid-January now Dr Holohan is predicting this will be a reality by the second week of the month.That might not seem like a big difference but it is when you are dealing with exponential growth, as seems likely next month.That our figures have already “bottomed out”, as the chief medical officer said, is evident in the ergent trends over 14 days and seven days.Ireland has the lowest 14-day incidence of the virus in Europe, and this rate has dropped 25 per cent over the previous 14 days.In contrast, the measure of trends over the past seven days is up 11 per cent compared to the previous seven days, and Ireland suddenly has the fifth fastest rising seven-day incidence in the EU.The heavy messaging of public health officials against socialising over the coming weeks may dampen festivities somewhat and curb the spread of the virus, but only to a limited extent given the high starting point after Level 5 restrictions. High figuresOur big problem is an amalgam of smaller problems which are not difficult to discern. First, the Border the incidence of the virus in Donegal is 2.5 times the rest of the country, and is rising again more quickly than elsewhere. Louth also has high figures.This is hardly surprising given that Northern Ireland has four times the number of cases as the Republic. The virus continues to spill over from the North, seriously damaging the Republic’s chance of reining it in. We also have a hospital problem. The two counties with the highest incidence at present are Donegal and Kilkenny, where large outbreaks in local hospitals are filling wards and causing deaths.Across the country hospital outbreaks accounted for 46 deaths out of the 140 that occurred last month, more even than the 41 recorded in nursing homes.According to Dr Holohan’s letter, there were 60 hospital clusters last month in 24 locations, involving 1,000 cases. This is why serial testing of healthcare workers is being introduced in January, making Ireland the first country in the world to undertake such a measure. Though why wait until January?The high incidence of cases among over-65s is also a problem, though continuing outbreaks in nursing homes may largely account for this.Both the hospital and nursing home outbreaks are being brought under control, and another positive sign is the continuing low number of cases in schools (a trends seen in the UK and other countries).Even so, as Dr Holohan says, a surge in January is now “more likely than not”."},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431158.1607462023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lack of maternity leave for politicians a glaring barrier for women td says","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Social Democrats TD Holly Cairns said she is pushing for legislation to permit maternity leave for elected officials.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins.The lack of maternity leave for public representatives is a “glaring barrier” for women who want to enter politics, a TD has claimed.Social Democrats TD Holly Cairns said she is pushing for legislation to permit maternity leave for elected officials, following Minister for Justice Helen McEntee’s announcement that she is pregnant.Ms McEntee will become the first senior Cabinet minister to give birth while in office.Ms Cairns has offered to pair with the Justice Minister for all votes if changes to allow her take maternity leave are not introduced before she gives birth next year.“It’s kind of mad that she’s the first member of Cabinet to give birth while in office it’s even madder that there isn’t any provision for maternity leave. That goes for senators, councillors and TDs,” she said.Ms Cairns said when she was first elected to Cork County Council, female councillors spoke of the “trauma” of giving birth while being an elected official.“They were working from their maternity beds, they had to take sick leave which is, quite frankly, insulting, and their wages were being docked. Of course, they felt like they were being judged by the electorate for not being at council meetings and it’s just ridiculous in 2020 that we’re even talking about this,” she said.“I think the reality is if we had more women at these decision-making tables all along, we probably wouldn’t be having this conversation and perhaps if we had maternity leave for public representatives, we would have more women at those decision-making tables.”Ms Cairns first raised the issue with the Taoiseach back in July and has since been working on a Bill with the Bills Office in Leinster House. She hopes to get an update from the office later this week, but acknowledged there are “a lot of complications” in providing leave.“Obviously, the electorate vote for somebody to vote on their behalf and when we look at the option of having a replacement, like a locum, there’s a question there of can that happen when they haven’t been elected to vote on behalf of the people. Does that need to be included on the ballot? There are different questions like that,” she added.Ms Cairns suggested remote voting could also be used as a possible solution. She added that she hopes there will be cross-party support on the issue.Meanwhile, Fine Gael TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill introduced a Bill on Tuesday to enable remote voting in the Oireachtas, a move which, she said, could “remove the barrier to maternity leave” for politicians.“We have had lots of talk about maternity leave for politicians. This Bill is part of that conversation and is one of the first steps towards flexible maternity provision for TDs and Senators. At a minimum, maternity or paternity provision requires the possibility of remote or proxy voting,” she said.“I believe all workers who are parents with young children should be afforded parental discretion, including members of the Oireachtas. It should be the parents’ choice together as to how to spend the weeks and months following the birth, or adoption, of their new baby.”Legal reform for the provision of maternity care was promised more than 40 years ago but was never delivered. At present, TDs have to provide a sick note if they wish to take time off to be with their newborn children."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431186.1607460824!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"partners of pregnant women to be allowed at 20 week scan in change to hse covid policy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHundreds of emails and letters from distressed and angry women and their partners were sent to the Government. Photograph: iStockThe HSE has bowed to a campaign to reverse its prohibition on partners of pregnant women attending maternity hospitals for 20-week scans and surgical interventions. The measure was introduced as a Covid-19 precaution in hospitals but has led to a huge backlash from couples using maternity services, some of whom have described the ban as inhumane, cruel and heart-breaking. Hundreds of emails and letters from distressed and angry women and their partners to the Government have been released to Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín who has described their content as “harrowing” and deeply distressing. “It is clear now that the restrictions around maternity services are inhumane and disproportionate,” he said.“We must remember that one in four pregnancies end in miscarriage in this country. No woman should be left to face this bad news alone, in a hospital corridor without a partner to support her.” The correspondence indicates the level of anxiety and frustration at the decision not to allow partners into the 19 maternity facilities in the State, particularly for the anomaly scan. Partners are allowed in for births but not for scans or emergency procedures. Some 172 people wrote to the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly and Taoiseach Micheál Martin during six weeks in the autumn, and hundreds more since then. A petition organised against the restrictions by campaign group, Uplift, has gathered 52,000 signatures. The HSE is expected to ask maternity facilities on Wednesday to allow partners visit for anomaly scans if possible. The new advice is understood to have stemmed from lower rates of transmission in the community, as well as listening to the views of patients and clinicians.One woman who experienced a miscarriage wrote to Mr Donnelly in September asking why it was acceptable for six people to socialise while partners were not allowed in maternity hospitals. “This is simply unacceptable. At no point was I allowed to have my husband present to provide any sort of comfort. I sat for hours alone and broken in one of your maternity hospitals. Not a single person to offer me the comfort I craved and needed.”Another woman wrote: “I am currently on my second pregnancy. My first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage which I’m sure I don’t have to tell you was a very stressful and traumatic experience. Thankfully I had the support of my partner and my mother when I found out this awful news. Without that support, I don’t know how I would have coped. Now, my heart breaks for anyone who has had to hear those words alone due to the restrictions.” A woman receiving fertility treatment recalled two failed pregnancies in 2019.“I could not imagine what it would have been like going for my first scan without my husband when the monitor turned dark and the midwife told me there was no heartbeat. “It is an unexpected and earth-shattering experience that no woman should have to go through alone and it is a scandal of our time that women are being forced to endure this.”A woman, writing to the Taoiseach, spoke of living through a global pandemic while pregnant. “I attended all of the scans on my own. I attended appointments on my own. Antenatal classes were cancelled. Social interactions with other first-time mothers just wasn’t possible…I was admitted to hospital for one night at 31 weeks. “I had high blood pressure and was experiencing dizzy spell. My husband was so worried but all he could do was simply leave me to the hospital door. I felt so weak and scared trying to find my way around the hospital. I had to be practical and keep thinking I need to be strong for our baby.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4431177.1607457792!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit talks on a sticky wicket but no one is pulling up stumps yet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Despite atmosphere of gloom and pessimism, each side believes the other still wants a deal. Photograph: Andy RainEPAWhen Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen sit down for dinner in Brussels on Wednesday evening, it will be in an atmosphere of deepening pessimism on both sides of the negotiations. As Michel Barnier told EU foreign ministers on Tuesday that no deal was now more likely that a deal, Johnson was himself musing about the talks’ failure.“We are always hopeful, but there may come a moment when we have to acknowledge that it is time to draw stumps, and that is just the way it is,” he said, referring to the end of play in cricket.For all the rhetorical gloom encircling the negotiations, the actions on both sides tell a more promising story. Tuesday’s announcement that the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and Maros Sefcovic had resolved in principle all outstanding issues about the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol was an unexpected breakthrough.The joint committee process is separate from the trade negotiations, but Tuesday’s agreement is evidence that even the most apparently intractable disagreements between Britain and the EU can be resolved. And the deal has allowed the British government to withdraw treaty-breaking clauses from the Internal Market Bill and to pull similar clauses from a forthcoming taxation Bill.LeverageThe clauses, which Johnson hoped would give him more leverage in the talks, instead became a trap that increased the price of an agreement and the cost of failing to reach a deal. His threat to break international law pushed the EU into demanding stronger safeguards and enforcement mechanisms and threatened to undermine his relationship with US president-elect Joe Biden if there was no deal.If Johnson’s retreat is self-interested, it also removes an obstacle in the way of a trade deal with the EU ahead of his meeting with von der Leyen. The European Commission said on Tuesday that the meeting would not be a negotiating session but would seek to unblock the talks before handing them back to the negotiators.Barnier and his British counterpart David Frost have made an audit of the remaining differences which will form the basis of the two leaders’ talks. Von der Leyen will have a chance to discuss any possible compromises with EU leaders at Thursday’s European Council and negotiations could, if they don’t break down, continue until next week.Each side believes the other still wants a deal and, despite the deadlock on fisheries, the level playing field and governance, neither looks ready to pull up stumps just yet.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178British Armed forces to introduce mental fitness as part of military training from April  Exclusive: Military cuts of £1bn over next year, with Navy Reservists suspended for first time Police \u0026#39duty bound\u0026#39 to investigate reports of too many households meeting over ChristmasPrison staff told to use whistles to call for help in emergencies because they are so short of radiosEuropean politicians mock Britain’s celebration of being first nation to roll out Covid vaccineRoyal train UK tour: Cambridges\u0026#39 rail journey ends in Windsor with the Queen and senior royalsSchools to break up a day early for Christmas after pressure from unions over teacher self-isolation fearsGermany says attempts to ide the EU over Brexit have failedBrexit deal: what has been agreed, and what happens next?Brexit Day 2020: When is the UK due to leave the EU and how will it happen?Joe Biden set to make history by appointing first ever black Pentagon chiefCovid-19 vaccine: Latest updates on Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer breakthroughs - and who will get it first?Chinese \u0026#39spy\u0026#39 befriended US political rising stars in alleged influence plotComment: Beware the Left’s new craze for wealth taxesNicola Sturgeon accused of \u0026#39moving the goalposts\u0026#39 after keeping low Covid areas in Tier 3Meet the UK\u0026#39s history makers: the first people in the world to get the Pfizer Covid vaccineCoronavirus vaccine Q\u0026ampA: how, when and where will I get a jab? School exams scrapped in Scotland as students face \u0026#39unfair\u0026#39 charges for halls they are banned fromHomeowner threatened with £10k fine by police after his Christmas light display attracted crowdsWhy London could be facing tier 3 lockdown restrictionsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"data showing rising cases second lockdown quietly revised","story":"While the survey on November 6 estimated there were 44,100 daily infections on October 17, that estimation has since dropped 26,600. “Really struggling to see how a period which for every single week previously was estimated to exhibit rising new infections suddenly turns flat based on data collected almost two months later,” Dr Howdon wrote on Twitter. “This also suggests cases were flat at the point where lockdown was announced and suddenly rose through lockdown to mid-November, when they dropped off.”The original ONS data was used by the Government\u0027s chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer Chris Whitty at the press conference on October 31 to justify a second lockdown.The Government has already been criticised by the official statistics watchdog for the way it presented data to justify England\u0027s second lockdown.A forecast made by Public Health England and Cambridge University said the country could soon be seeing more than 4,000 deaths a day. But the projections were out of date and vastly overestimated deaths.The UK Statistics Authority said there needed to be more transparency about data and how predictions were being made.It later emerged that the Government had redrawn its graphs so they no longer suggested that deaths could soon overtake those at the peak of the first wave.Many experts have complained that the data presented by the Government ahead of the lockdown was “riddled with errors” and exaggerated the need for a second lockdown, while Greg Clark, the chairman of the Commons science and technology committee, said the belated admission of errors was “of great concern”.A spokesman for the ONS said: “Our official estimates have not changed and these are the ones we advise to be used.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dismissed eton teacher seeks act parliament reinstate post","story":"A dismissed Eton teacher is seeking an Act of Parliament to reinstate him to his post, as he encourages his supporters to lobby MPs and peers to rally behind his cause.Will Knowland was sacked for gross misconduct after recording a lecture which questioned current radical feminist orthodoxy” and then refusing to remove it from his YouTube channel.If his dismissal is upheld by the school’s appeal panel, which met on Tuesday and is due to deliver its verdict early next week, he intends to invoke an obscure branch of legislation in a last-ditch attempt to win back his job.Writing to his supporters, he explained his strategy: “Another way in which I might hope to secure the support of members of both Houses of Parliament is by lodging a petition for a Personal Bill.“My petition would be to try and secure a Personal Act of Parliament reinstating me as a Master at Eton College. Like any Bill that goes through Parliament, there would be scrutiny by a Select Committee of my case, and any petition opposing the Bill by the College. Parliament would hear evidence and submissions from counsel.”Personal Bills are a form of Private Bills which relate to the “estate, property, status or style, or otherwise relating to the personal affairs, of an inidual”.They have traditionally been used for orce or to permit otherwise forbidden marriages and were popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.But they have fallen out of use in recent years and the last Act resulting from a Private Bill was passed in 1987 to enable the marriage of George Donald Evans and Deborah Jane Evans.Mr Knowland explained to his supporters that the benefits of a Parliamentary procedure are that “it would allow Masters, and other members of the Eton Community, to be able to speak freely about these issues under the protection of Parliamentary privilege”.But he said that the possibility of bringing about the Personal Bill will “ultimately rest” on support he could muster from MPs and peers.“Therefore, if you do have contact with Honourable Members of either House, I would be forever grateful if you would convey your views on my case, and the need for freedom of expression to be protected while delivering a balanced curriculum of erse viewpoints to the wonderful students at the College,” he said.Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union which has been supporting Mr Knowland, said they will petition Parliament to pass a Personal Bill to intervene in his case if Eton does not reinstate him.“There’s so much at stake here, Parliament must be given an opportunity to make its feelings known,” Mr Young said.He warned that if Eton’s appeal panel upholds the decision to dismiss Mr Knowland, it could have a “chilling effect” in schools and make it “impossible” for teachers to talk about controversial ideas in the classroom.Eton College has been engulfed in a free speech row following Mr Knowland’s dismissal. His controversial lecture, titled “The Patriarchy Paradox” was part of the Perspectives course taken by sixth form students to encourage them to think critically about subjects of public debate.Mr Knowland alleged that he was banned from delivering the lecture to pupils and then dismissed after he refused to remove a video of it from his personal YouTube channel.Eton has said the dismissal was not a matter of free speech but one of internal discipline.The £42,500-a-year school has said it was left with no choice but to ask Mr Knowland to remove the video from the internet as it fell foul of equality laws.An Eton College spokesman said: “The appeal hearing has concluded and, as laid down by school procedure, a decision is normally delivered within seven calendar days.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"v day watershed moment may have wear masks another year","story":"“V-Day” is a watershed moment in the fight against Covid-19, Sir Patrick Vallance has said, but he has warned that masks may need to be worn for another year.As hospitals across the country began the NHS vaccination programme, the UK\u0027s chief scientific adviser suggested that restrictions may remain in place even after its full rollout.Sir Patrick said that while studies have established that the jabs prevent the virus taking hold in the body, it is not yet known how effective they are in blocking transmission. He said: It may be that next winter, even with vaccination we need measures like masks in place. We don\u0027t know yet how good all the vaccines are going to be at preventing the transmission of the virus.The Government scientist also said it would take “quite a long time” to make sure everyone in the at risk groups receives their jabs, urging the public to “stick to the rules”.Sir Patrick said that the public could not afford to “let our guard down” as the vaccine is rolled out. “Today is a watershed moment in the fight against Covid-19 as the first vaccinations are administered,” he said, paying tribute to the scientists, researchers, manufacturers and volunteers behind the breakthrough. “Whilst we start the first steps on the path to getting back to normality in due course, we need to remain vigilant, not let our guard down as the vaccine is rolled out, but this is still a tremendous day of celebration,” he said. Meanwhile, the Health Secretary repeatedly urged the public “not to blow it” in its efforts to fight the virus now that the vaccination programme is underway.A number of MPs suggested that the same message should be applied to Government, with Labour MP Bill Esterson highlighting the failures of the NHS Test and Trace programme in contact those at risk of infection.Conservative MP and chairman of the new Covid Recovery Group Mark Harper said it is not right to maintain every restriction until the entire population has been vaccinated.Mr Hancock replied: The House might be relieved to know that (Mr Harper) and I agree with each other on the need to ensure that as the vaccine is rolled out to vulnerable groups, so we therefore monitor the impact of the vaccine on reducing cases, reducing hospitalisations and reducing the number of people who sadly die from this disease, and taking that basis for the judgment of how soon we can lift the restrictions.He and I want to lift the restrictions as soon as is safely possible and the question of that judgment of how safely is one that we will have to monitor and debate in this House over the coming weeks and months. Earlier, the Health Secretary said he hopes several million people will have been vaccinated by Christmas, but stressed the need for everyone to stick at the restrictions.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: As of this morning, right now several dozen people have been vaccinated and by Christmas several million people will have been vaccinated.But we\u0027ve got to protect those who are vulnerable.Mr Hancock continued: The second dose is in three weeks\u0027 time, and then it takes a week to get full immunity, so, even for those who were the first to be vaccinated, we\u0027ve still got a month until they are protected.And then we\u0027ve got to ensure that people who are vulnerable to this disease are protected and then we can lift the restrictions and that will take months, so we\u0027ve got to stick at it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"would keir starmer better leading lib dems","story":"I last attended the House of Lords in person on February 27 and since then  have frequently listened to proceedings but not spoken in the Chamber, not even virtually, as that seems to me a very awkward affair. However, I have gradually learned the art of participation in other meetings, with a good deal of help from my far more technically savvy secretary and I even hope to enjoy a virtual Christmas gathering with my wider family.Even if the vaccines demonstrate that they can see off the Covid plague and, as an older person, I get to the front of the queue for treatment, it looks unlikely that my absence from Westminster will be much less than a year.The other absentee from Westminster is union cash for Labour’s leader, Sir Keir Starmer. The trade union Unite was traditionally a very big financial supporter giving £1.5 million in the first eight months of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership and another £3 million for Labour’s general election fund last year.Money, they say, speaks louder than words, so it sounds as though the leaders of Britain’s largest trade union still back Jeremy Corbyn rather than Sir Keir Starmer, which bodes ill for the level of turnout for Labour at next year’s local elections. Perhaps whilst the poor chap is in self isolation he might give some consideration to cutting free from the Labour Party and its lingering smell of anti-Semitism and instead taking over leadership of the Lib Dems, whose policies are rather closer to his own thinking. It would be a boon for that party too given that very few voters could tell you who is their leader without asking Google first.As a traveller by car from my East Anglian home to Westminster I hope that Labour’s  fanatical anti-car clique at County Hall, which is set on the obstruction of cars, vans and lorries from London’s road network, is thrown out at next year’s municipal elections. That clique says that cars, vans and lorries cause pollution, but by impeding the motor traffic they are increasing the pollution. They would do better to encourage electric vehicles by providing more and cheaper charging facilities.  It is rather a pity that, like Sir Keir Starmer, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has his own problem of party disunity in the House of Commons. It is not difficult to pick holes in the current restrictions on personal movements, business and trade or the boundaries of the tiers across England and Wales but with the welcome prospect of the heavy artillery of immunisation blasting Covid-19 to defeat by the end of January, is it worthwhile tearing the Conservative Parliamentary Party apart in the last few weeks of the pandemic? There is plenty for Parliament to do to get our economy going again and bring jobs back here once we leave the European Union and are free to manage our own country again as a free nation.The sickening hypocrisy of the “woke” folk, always deploring violence but seldom missing a chance to indulge in it continues apace even in middle England. The bronze statue of Margaret Thatcher intended for Parliament Square has been looking for a home ever since those who declared she was too isive a figure threatened such violence if it were to be erected there that the authorities gave in to keep the peace.Now threats of disorder and egg-throwing are being made against a proposal to erect the statue in her home town of Grantham and a referendum has been suggested to decide if that should go ahead. But would the woke folk who threaten violence be deterred by a majority vote to erect the statue? I wouldn’t bet on it.Of course they will have been encouraged by the action of Judge Christopher Hehir in failing to adequately punish Astrophel Sang who joined a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Westminster and tried to burn the Union Flag on the Cenotaph, our national memorial to men and women, black and white alike, who have died fighting for  freedom.Thank God that such people were not around to impede Churchill, Attlee, Bevin and their colleagues who came together to lead Britons of all colours, not to mention all those people from around the Empire and across the world who did so much, to victory in the Second World War against Hitler’s National Socialist Germany. Would that we had their like to complete Brexit and regain our freedom to manage our own affairs today.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexiteers firm backs out plan","story":"NewsBrexiteers firm backs out of plan to build new car in UK and shts production to FranceSir Jim Ratclfe had said his firm Ineos would build the Grenadier vehicle in Bridgend, Wales, creating  new jobs.

Ineos Automotive confirmed its new x cars will be manufactured in France, ending hopes that a new plant in Wales could be built. The firm said the former Mercedes-Benz Hambach factory in Moselle, France, will build the Grenadier vehicles instead following a deal with the German carmaker. Production of a new vehicle was due to begin in Bridgend next year, creating around  jobs initially, rising to  once the vehicle reached full production. But Ineos starting hinting that plans could change during the summer as the Hambach site looked more attractive. The company said on Tuesday the new factory was well located for access to markets, suppliers and automotive talent. The decision is the second major blow for Bridgend, where the initial site was due to open, as it had been planned to be beside the now-closed Ford engine plant.Ford shut its factory in September after  years, with the loss of nearly , jobs, in a long line of car manufacturers to leave the UK or reduce output over Brexit concerns.Ineos boss Sir Jim Ratclfe, a prominent Brexit supporter, said: Hambach presented us with a unique opportunity that we simply could not ignore: to buy a modern automotive manufacturing facility with a world-class workforce. Ineos Automotive set out a vision to build the worldaposs best utilitarian x, and at our new home in Hambach, we will do just that. The site currently builds electric vehicles, which Ineos will continue to produce, but the move is expected to be a bitter blow for Wales, with politicians actively courting Sir Jim for investment in the region. Chris Elmore, MP for Ogmore in Bridgend, tweeted the decision was a crushing blow for the area.

He said: “Jobs, businesses and lives depend on a solution to this. We need to sort it out right away. “The mental health crisis has grown all year. There is a mental health crisis that will exist beyond the pandemic and there is clear evidence that this failure to support excluded groups has had an impact. “Only the Chancellor can bring these people in from the cold.” It comes as a separate survey found one in  excluded people reported they were suffering from mental health issues.

Nick Gibb told MPs that heads would be able to hold inset days at the end of term to ensure a “clear six days” before Christmas Eve.

Up to , state school pupils missed school on December  due to coronavirus - between % and % of pupils - according to the latest Department for Education figures.

Mr Gibb said: “We want there to be a clear six days so that by the time we reach Christmas Eve staff can have a proper break without having to engage in the track and trace issues.” The last-minute guidance comes after the Government told schools they were not allowed to close early for the Christmas break as part of the Covid Winter Plan.

But fishing, while itaposs worth comparatively little to the UK, is politically impossible to ignore. Itaposs emblematic of the entire Brexit argument - Britannia ruling the waves as a sovereign nation, evil Johnny Foreigner nicking our fish and chips, and a load of old pollocks pretending to be something theyaposre not.Because while Johnson and his Hard Brexit weirdos bang on about piracy on the high seas, theyaposre forgetting the uncomfortable fact that the British fishing industry is not particularly British. Most of the British fishing fleet is controlled by just five firms - pescatarian barons who send supertrawlers out to scrape the seas of all that might be edible. The fuel their ships use is heavily subsidised by the EU.Government statistics show % of the deckhands are foreign nationals, who are cheaper and, as of January , will need to apply for visas to do the work theyaposre underpaid for, or  do it in France.They mostly fish for mackerel, which has the most profits, and itaposs mostly all sold to Europe. And less than three-quarters of it is from UK waters. The rest comes from - gasp - foreign seas.But % less mackerel is landed than in , even though the quotas have been set higher than science advises, because the drive for cash means fish stocks are disappearing.Oh, and at least one of these barons donated to the Vote Leave campaign. He must be VERY clever.Johnson is tying himself in knots over an industry with , fishermen, not all of whom are British. By comparison, the collapse of Arcadia about which the government is doing nothing involves , jobs, the failure of Debenhams risks , jobs, and the UK car industry which will collapse in a No Deal Brexit involves , workers, directly and indirectly. And , as threatened, Britain turns down an EU agreement for the sake of those fishermenaposs right to not bump into les Francaises dans le mer, those same fishermen will be facing big EU tarfs on the mackerel which they will be less able to sell abroad, but which will suddenly turn up, nice and cheap, on our supermarket shelves next to the chorinated chicken. And donapost assume, for a moment, that they can merelyto fishing for cod, and weaposll all get cheaper fish and chips. About % of the cod we consume comes from the waters around Norway and Iceland. Neither are EU members, but both are in the European Economic Area, and allow our fleet into their waters under its rules. After Brexit, they both want to fish in our waters too. So no sharing our waters, no chip supper.  To sum up - we fish in other waters, rely on foreigners to fish in our own waters, sell and buy fish with European nations, and in protecting fishing rights, are only protecting the rights of about five major corporations, some of which are foreign-owned.Itaposs the perfect emblem of Brexit, in that youaposre being lied to in order to convince you to support a thing which is ultimately more damaging than the thing youaposve already got.And thereaposs no need for the lies, because thereaposs a good pro-Brexit argument for fishing. These fleets burn huge amounts of oil that, after Brexit, will need to be subsidised in a world that wants to be greener. Post-Brexit, the government could tie fuel subsidies to cleaner vessels, better wages, higher safety standards.Quotas set by the EU have, according to campaigners, been far too high compared to the scientic advice on keeping the seas well-stocked. After we leave, we could set better quotas in our own waters, trading access to them with other nations infor healthier numbers of fish.And we could also use the laws of the sea as a blueprint for how we should deal with Europe after Brexit - co-operation, mutual interest, a better environment, and an understanding that,the fish get to keep their freedom of movement, perhaps humans could remember that borders are optional, too."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus cases rising third england","story":"NewsCoronavirus cases rising in third of England - heres where could be heading for Tier Seven days ago, just  out of a total of  local authority areas had recorded a week-on-week jump in rates - that figure is now up to  local authority areasmirrorShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video towns-cities-tier--very-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Mark Jonesapos seven-year-old daughter Emily died on March  after being stabbed in the throat by schizophrenic Eltiona Skana, , in a park in Bolton, Greater Manchester. In a heart-wrenching statement read to court Mr Jones asked How can you put into words how you feel about the senseless death of your only child  He said Emily was the beat in their hearts and their reason for getting up every morning. He added: How can an innocent child, playing in the park, be killed in such a violent and monstrous way  Over the course of a seven-day trial this month, the court heard Skana grabbed Emily as she was riding a scooter towards her mum on Motheraposs day. The defendant then slashed the child across the neck with one hand and threw her to the ground before attempting to escape the area. Mr Jones paid tribute to his little girl today in a heartbreaking statement read out at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, where Skana is being sentenced for manslaughter. Skana was found not guilty of murder after a trial but previously admitted to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Mr Jonesapos emotional statement was read to the court this morning by barrister Michael Brady QC. He said: How can you put into words how you feel about the senseless death of your only child  It is just too dficult to comprehend. Emily was the beat in our hearts, the spring in our step and the reason we got up every morning. Emily was our beautul, spirited little girl, a bundle of energy with an infectious personality. She was bright and funny, a kind child with not a mean bone in her body. Emily loved le and had not a care in the world. One smile from Emily and she had her daddy wrapped around her little finger.  Emily was a loveable child, full of innocence and wonder. She was just starting out on her path of le and her future has cruelly been cut so short. Our future has also been taken away. How can you enjoy le when the biggest part of it isnapost there anymore. We will never see Emily grow and become the wonderful young lady we knew she would become, we will never see her hold her own child in her arms, as we held her. Emily brought out something special in everyone who was lucky enough to be in her le. The loss of Emily has had a profound and signicant impact, not just on her family, but the whole community. Emily was someoneaposs school friend, a play mate and of course a grand daughter and a niece and she meant something very special and unique to each and everyone of them.

Lori Addison-Simmons, , said she gritted her teeth to carry on with her job at Hermes as she is a single mother needing to provide for her two children. But she described feeling depressed and anxious and being like a robot while working for the delivery company - which she joined in January, StokeonTrentLive reports. Lori would load her car at the firmaposs Fenton depot at am and work flat out to complete her delivery run around Longton and Dresden by pm six days a week.  The courier described how she changed car five times in the course of her one-year employment at the company. But what afflicted her most was how she had no time to be there for her two children. Lori said: “I was getting home late. My daughter goes to secondary school and she was coming in and I was not getting in until around pm. “It was not fair on her and when I was at home I was too tired to do anything.  The job is supposed to fit around you and your circumstances. But there was one day when I had  items and got a call to say there were another  on my run. My car was already full and yet I needed to go back to the depot to pick another  up. “The most I had in the house would be about  parcels. That includes big boxes and packets. My living room was once taken over.” Lori says she was paid for each item delivered. It was p for a packet and £ for heavier parcels. Matters came to a head last month when her vehicle broke down - with  parcels in her car. She secured cover to deliver some of the parcels and faced having to take the rest on foot.  Lori added: “I was told they had to go out that day. But I couldnapost take them on foot because some of the streets were right up the top of Abbey Hulton. I was not doing that. “I’d given them almost a yearaposs commitment and I couldnapost take anymore. “I loved the job because I loved the customers. They were the ones keeping me going but I felt just like a number. “Sometimes the customers don’t understand how pressured we are and when I went out to deliver I put a smile on and had a joke but sometimes I was dying inside because I was so upset. “During one of my rounds I broke down in the car and I just felt fed-up and ignored.

Mays who was married to Louiseaposs aunt, was found guilty of murder at Winchester Crown Court today.The -year-old, who had entered the witness box in his own defence and denied intending to kill Louise, claimed he had genuinely forgotten he had killed Louise. The killer said he only remembered when he was in prison in Bristol after being held in custody by murder squad detectives some weeks later. After the jury unanimously convicted Mays of murder, he showed no visible emotion but sat in his grey prison jumper and looked forward, although an audible gasp could be heard around the court. Mrs Justice May DBE, who had presided over the trial, told jurors: Members of the jury, we ask a lot in cases like this of our citizens. You cannot have imagined when the jury summons came through your door that you would be sitting on a case like this. Although asked to sentence straight away by both prosecution and defence counsel, the High Court judge retired and said she would read victim impact statements from Louiseaposs mother, father and step-father.  When Louise Smith went missing, the local area of Leigh Park became awash with missing posters and leaflets bearing pictures of her in a blue prom dress. Her face was beamed around the world in news stories after her body was found and details of her death were revealed during the trial of Mays, which started on November . The lawyer defending Mays had warned the High Court judge that a planned site visit, which involved busing the jury down to Leigh Park, could pose risks to his clientaposs safety, stating feelings run very high in the locality. Such were the concerns that Hampshire Constabulary was asked to have a large police escort block off certain roads.  Jurors were taken on a route which meant they avoided passing the home of Rebbeca Jayne Cooper, Louiseaposs mother, whose house had been covered in photos of Louise in her prom dress and now stood as a makesht shrine to the murdered teenager. Louise had been classed as a vulnerable child due to a history of self-harming, the use of anti-depressant medication and a volatile relationship with her mother. After a particularly bad argument with her mum, which was partly about her boyfriend Bradley Kercher, Louise went to stay with another aunt before being taken in by Chazlynn Mays, known as CJ, who boasted that she was the stronger auntie.  In reality CJ was herself an unemployed woman who lived off Employment Support Allowance and did not like to venture outside of her one-bedroom flat in Somborne Drive. Her main pastime was managing the affairs of her dependent husband, Shane Mays, whose phone, social media accounts and spending money she controlled. The court heard that a clinical review of the defendant found he had an extremely low IQ of , putting him in the bottom one percentile of people. He also scored in the . percentile range of memory, which tests his ability for retaining information over a short period Mays spent each day playing nine hours of Xbox video games and spending his £ allowance dished out by CJ in whichever way he wished - until Louise Smith arrived at the flat.  From the day Louise moved in with him on April  this year, Shane initiated bizarre play fighting games with her, one of which Louise captured in a video she sent to her boyfriend Bradley. In a message, Louise had said: Sorry babe, Shane just attacked me and started tickling my foot and s***. I was crying with laughter. Later messages between Louise and her friends showed evidence of rising tensions, as CJ barred Louiseaposs boyfriend from staying at the home and Shane Mays warned Louise thatshe did not start helping around the house, then he would start to get stricter with her. Louise, who was said to live through her phone, had told a number of online friends they are just vile and vowed to leave the Maysapos home, which she did on May  by going missing.  When she ed, she and the Mays were captured on CCTV going to the local shops to buy Rum, peach Schnapps and a number of sweets, which prosecutors suggested was an attempt by Shane Mays to get Louise drunk so he could sexually touch her. The next day, for reasons unknown, Mays and Louise walked together into Havant Thicket where he killed her. He claimed he had punched her repeatedly, kneeling over her body to deliver powerful blows until he heard her bones crack. Following her death, Louise, who was training to be a veterinary nurse, was described by her family as a smiley, generous person.

Matt Moulding, founder of Manchester-based The Hut Group, said about  staff had been gted free shares in the past  years. “We have created more millionaires than any other company in British corporate history,” he told the Mirror in an exclusive interview. “The shares are % gted, no-one has had to pay anything.” “We have genuinely changed so many lives.” Those quids in range from managers through secretaries and warehouse workers. The shares windfalls have already turned  workers at the firm into millionaires, he said. That number is set to rise as, of the near £billion worth of shares set aside for staff, around £million has yet to be handed out. Some of those benefiting from the £million will be graduates and school leavers who will get “le changing sums,” said Mr Moulding. The -year-old has enjoyed his own le changing surge in wealth after building The Hut Group into one of Britain’s biggest tech firms. His % stake is worth around £.billion and a surge in its share price triggered a £million shares payout for him.  On the focus on his fortune, the father-of-four said: “Look, I guess it’s to be expected in some form, but it’s not something I seek out. “I am doing this because I’m passionate about it. “There is a lot of focus around what my wealth might be, but the amount of money we have shared is off the chart. Mr Moulding, who plans to donate his entire £, salary to charity, was born in Colne near Burnley in Lancashire, His first job was washing dishes, he was expelled from college for playing truant, became a factory hand, then started out selling CDs online before starting to run websites for other retailers.  The Hut Group also sells everything from mascara to vegan protein bars. It floated on the stock market in September, and is worth £.billion. The firm’s stock market debut focused attention on Mr Moulding’s dual role as both chief executive and chairman. He denied he was a “control freak, and insisted the structure was common in a number of other big companies. There have also been question marks about his retention of a “golden share” that allows him to veto any takeover.  He said: “It has one pursue, there is not another single other benefit to it, it allows me to veto a hostile takeover, an international business coming along and buying the business. “It only lasts for three years in total and after that time we are at the mercy of the markets.” Mr Moulding also revealed an ambition to create another , jobs - , a year - by , nearly doubling in size.

Brits were also delighted to see that Margaret opted to wear a Christmas t-shirt for the monumental moment - but it wasnapost just any festive outfit. The former jewellery shop assistant, who turns  next week, had the vaccine while wearing a charity tee supporting the local hospital which gave her the vaccine. The blue top, which features a penguin wearing a red scarf and hat, is from the University Hospitals Coventry  Warwickshire Charity. Speaking after the injection, Margaret said: Hopefully itaposll help other people come along and do what I did, and try and do the best to get rid of this terrible thing. To tell you the truth I got this opportunity of doing it, and I was in hospital. It was a great opportunity, added Mrs Keenan, who only retired from her job in a jewellers four years ago. I know that one or two people on my ward are going to wait and have it done by the doctor, but because it was available for me today . I donapost mind theattention, it doesnapost bother me. Iaposm just happy to have it done.  She will receive a booster jab in  days to ensure she has the best chance of being protected against the virus.

Dr David Hepburn, an intensive care consultant at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport who caught Covid- himself, has discussed worries around the vaccine and why it is completely safe to take. Margaret Keenan, , was the first person to ever receive a Covid- vaccine, as apart of the biggest vaccination programme in NHS history this morning. She was among up to a  people set up to have the jab, which arrived in an insulated container only minutes before the injection. Now the inoculations have begun, the next challenge is making sure people receive it with some anxious about taking the vaccine that Dr Hepburn described as a aposgame changerapos.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people should not be afraid of getting vaccinated, and that people objecting to having the jab are ‘totally wrong’.He went on to say: ‘Itaposs safe, itaposs the right thing to do, itaposs good for you and itaposs good for the whole country.’ Dr Hepburn told WalesOnline : There is no agenda, there is no deep state conspiracy. Nobody is trying to inject you with microchips. Look at who you get your information from. Do you get your information from renowned scientists, big academic departments, your local doctors and medical staff or do you get it from something that a person has posted anonymously on Facebook In a QA he has spoken in depth about the vaccine including about possible side effects, how it is produced and explained why it as been able to be produced so quickly and stay safe. What was your reaction when you first heard about the new vaccine being approved  David Hepburn: It was fantastic news. I was absolutely elated because it was never a certainty we would get an effective vaccine so the fact they had one which was more than % effective could be a complete game-changer. I am and most of my colleagues are very pleased about that. Anything that can shorten the le of this pandemic has to be a good thing in my book. Some people are not necessarily anti-vaccine but they are concerned about how quickly it has been turned around. What do you say to those people  It may seem to have come along very fast and a lot of people are a bit worried about that. But when it normally takes  years to produce a vaccine a lot of that is dead time. If I wanted to develop a new vaccine the first thing you need to do is get seed money to do it and then I need to do investment rounds to get companies interested in putting the money into producing it. What I am also making the vaccine for can also be is a big problem. For example, say I come up with an idea for a vaccine for herpes. That is a disease that affects people fairly commonly but it is a bit niche and doesnapost have the huge, huge numbers we are seeing with Covid. One of the problems with getting a vaccine for something like that is that you need volunteers who are willing to try the vaccine and you also need a certain level of incidence in the community because the way studies are run in phase three is that you give half a people the vaccine and half the people a placebo. You follow those two groups till you get a trigger number of patients developing the disease. You are hoping that will be in the placebo group not in the vaccine group.  If you have a disease which isnapost very common in the community it can take years to reach the correct number before you can stop the trial. Because Covid is very widespread in the community and lots of people are catching it you can reach that level very quickly. Are there any other reasons that is has been produced so quickly  The other thing to say is there is no shortage of volunteers because everybody wants to see a vaccine for this disease so people were queuing up to be guinea pigs, essentially, for the first trial. Normally in vaccine trials the recruitment of your test groups takes an awfully long time so that cuts down the speed signicantly. Also the key is getting funding from drug companies or governments to pay for the research and that can often involve lots of resubmissions of funding applications which can be rejected or need to be changed. That red tape really slows things down. With Covid- lots of those barriers were removed because everybody is looking for a Covid- vaccine. Bringing out a vaccine and bringing it to trial takes a lot of money because you need to set up centres for recruitment etc. The whole process of finding funding and getting it approved and finding groups takes an awfully long time. But this has been made much quicker because Covid is the only game in town.  Every single vaccine and treatment could have side effects. Youaposve mentioned before it is a balance and weighing up the risks. Can you explain more about this  Vaccines are one of the safest treatments you can give people. We know that because there are lots and lots of vaccines out there that have been given for a number of years. You have the early reactions which are things like allergic reactions or short-term effects like feeling a bit rundown and a headache etc. These are very common with lots of vaccines. They usually happen within a couple of days of having it. There are rarer and more unusual side effects and here we are talking like between one in , to a one in ,, chance. Youaposve got to remember that vaccines are not a drug so they have got no pharmacological ingredients that are going to affect you in the same way that drugs do. They are either dead viruses that are injected into you so the body can recognise the viral proteins – and that is the basis of the Oxford vaccine – [or] alternatively they are a new type of vaccine called the mRNA vaccine which tells your body to produce a protein which is part of the virus so you are basically, rather than injecting a bit of dead virus into yourself, making your own bits of virus using your protein factories in your bodies so your antibodies can recognise it as foreign and deal with it.  So is it up to the person taking it to weigh up the risks  Every time we have a new set of flu vaccines there will be one or two people who suffer a form of vaccine reaction which is called antibody-mediated. This is when you get a vaccine and your body makes antibodies which are little proteins which recognise foreign invaders. What can happen is when you get a vaccine that instead of recognising the viral proteins of a foreign invader your body can accidentally, due to cross-reactivity, recognise some of your own cells as foreign invaders and then they prime your immune system to attack those cells. This can create something called Guillain-Barre syndrome and can happen after jabs but they can also happen after infections as well. That can cause worsening paralysis but generally does get better. There have been a few cases of that associated with the flu vaccine every year but in terms of the numbers of people who have a flu vaccine itaposs very, very small and very, very unlikely. You are more likely to get Guillain-Barre syndrome as a result of having food poisoning you get in your local takeaway then you are from a vaccine. It is all relative risk. You have up to one in a million chance of getting it from a vaccination but you have one in  risk of dying of Covid and probably a much higher risk of Long Covid. Think about operations. With operations there is a risk. There is a risk of bleeding and there is a risk of infection as well as blood clots and other things going wrong. Butthe operation is going to make you better you accept those risks – and vaccinations are exactly the same. Youaposre probably at more risk getting in your car every morning to take the kids to school. Our lives are all about calculated risks. Can misinformation about vaccinations be damaging  You have to weigh up the risks. I think most people are intelligent enough that they can weigh up the ious risks. You only have to look at the very much discredited and  work of Andrew Wakefield, who has now been struck off, who suggested there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. This has been categorically disproved and he had a big agenda in this, carried out very unethical experiments and then drew a conclusion that no-one has ever been able to replicate. But even the suggestion of this put people off vaccinating their kids.  Do you think there is a problem with the amount of people who are getting their information from social media Lately there has been a move to,I quote Michael Gove, have had enough of experts.This vaccine has come about because of a lot of work by scientists and assessed by the Medicines  Healthcare products Regulatory Agency who are very, very vigorous and independent scrutineers of these things. There is no agenda, there is no deep state conspiracy. Nobody is trying to inject you with microchips. Look at who you get your information from. Do you get your information from renowned scientists, big academic departments and your local doctors and medical staff or do you get it from something that a person has posted anonymously on Facebook  We all need to be looking at where we get our sources of information from. Are they credible  If a guy on Facebook is saying this is all a conspiracy but youaposve got most of the worldaposs scientists saying aposThis is not a conspiracy and here is the science behind itapos an intelligent person should be able to work out what is a more reliable source of information. I can understand people having misgivings of anything new and it does seem to have come about very quickly but actually understanding why it has come out quickly is important.

Victoria Osborne, , suffers from such extreme allergic reactions at this time of year she could go blind. She cannot be near articial trees, decorations, wrapping paper and scented candles and is also crippled with chronic migraines, triggered by bright flashing lights, such as dazzling Christmas displays. The mum-of-one has a severe allergy to formaldehyde, which is used to preserve dead bodies but also found in articial trees, ornaments, Christmas crackers, perfumes, and cleaning products. Exposure causes her eyes to burn like “rings of fire”.  Her eyelids swell to such an extent that blood flow is restricted and her doctors say she is at risk of losing her sight. Speaking on how it affects son Gabriel, , Victoria, said: “I watch everyone  going mad at Christmas, Elf on the Shelf, pyjamas, special drinks, tons and tons of food. We have none of that. I feel terribly guilty that Gabriel can’t have a proper Christmas. Bless him, he accepts it because he doesn’t want to make me ill. “I wish I could give him the magic of Christmas that he truly deserves, but it’s just not possible.

One woman, named Mel, recently stumbled across three clever kitchen utensil hacks on the social media  and the video of her reacting to them is simply priceless. Posting on the account @melbell, the woman watches someone from @foodie_we carry out them all in absolute awe. The first trick shows someone using the hole in the middle of a pasta scoop to create perfectly neat meatballs. They simply press the back of the spoon into a bowl of mince meat and the meat goes through the hole to form a ball. Next the back of a ladle is dipped into a batter mixture, removing excess drips. The ladle with the mixture on it then gets dunked into a pan of hot oil and cooks the batter, creating mini taco shells. The final hack shows someone using a pair of tongs to cut a slice of cake. They simply use the end where the tongs are joined together to cut through the songe, they then squeeze slightly to pull the piece out and place it on a plate. Mel watches the hacks with wide eyes, asking: How did I not know this ! The cake one really gets to her with her raising her hands to hold the sides of her face, mouth open in shock, as she says: Youaposre kidding! More than , people have liked her reactions, with many commenting to say they were also impressed by the hacks.One replied: I am today years old when I realised this.

Professor Haim Eshed, , says extraterrestrials have struck a deal with the US to stay silent while they conduct experiments on Earth and will only reveal themselves when mankind is ready.The retired general, who headed Israelaposs space programme for almost  years, claims the aliens have a secret base on Mars, the Jewish Press reports. But according to the professor, the alien race had to intervene to stop Donald Trump from blowing their cover and revealing their secrets.Speaking to Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aharonoth, Prof Eshed said: The aliens have asked not to announce that they are here. Humanity is not ready yet. The UFOs have asked not to publish that they are here. Humanity is not ready yet. According to Prof Eshed, MrTrump alsonegotiates with senior extraterrestrials via calls to world leaders such as Kim Jong-un. He added: Trump was on the verge of revealing, but the aliens in the Galactic Federation are saying aposwait, let people calm down firstapos, he told the Israeli paper. They don’t want to start mass hysteria. They want to first make us sane and understanding. The term aposGalactic Federationapos has been used in works of science fiction, including the TV phenomenon Doctor Who. Prof Eshed did not say how long the aliens have been hiding in the shadows but claims they have signed a contract with the US to do experiments here. He said the extraterrestrials will not reveal themselves until mankind has evolved and reached a stage where we will generally understand what space and spaceships are.  Prof Eshed holds a bacheloraposs degree in electronics engineering, a masteraposs degree in performance research and a doctorate in aeronautical engineering.

The first vaccines in Scotland will be administered today too.”mdash Nicola SturgeonDecember , The first vaccinations against the virus will begin at  centres across Scotland today, with those who are lined up to administer the injection to others receiving it first.They will be followed by residents in care homes from December , their carers and other frontline health workers, before prioritising those over  “as supplies allow”.On Monday, Ms Sturgeon met staff co-ordinating the vaccine at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.The First Minister had a tour of the facility and learned about the detailed preparation which has gone into organising the delivery of the vaccine.Speaking at the hospital yesterday, Ms Sturgeon said: #I’m grateful to everyone involved in giving this vaccine to those who need it most.“By vaccinating the priority groups they will be covering those associated with  per cent of preventable Covid- deaths. That is a very compelling reason to put these groups first in the queue for this vaccine.“Finally there is light at the end of the tunnel. But I ask everyone to be patient as we work our way through this vaccination programme, and continue to follow FACTS to keep us all safe.”UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Good Morning Scotland the next doses of the Covid- vaccine will arrive next week.He said: “The next scheduled arrival will be next week and the numbers depend on how quickly Pfizer can manufacture it.“It is being manufactured in Belgium and obviously right across the UK the job is to be able to get the vaccinations done as quickly as the manufacturer can create it, so we’ve been all working together really closely, the UK Government, which has been buying the vaccine and getting it delivered into the country, and then the NHS in the four nations of the UK.”Asked how quickly the vaccine can arrive and in what sort of numbers, he replied: “We’ve got a broad schedule, there will be several million for the UK as a whole, so several hundred thousand for Scotland over the remainder of this month.“We’ve got that as a broad delivery schedule but obviously the manufacturing process itself is complicated, so we’ve got to get the stuff in the country and then once it’s in the country we can be confident that we’re able to deliver it, and I’m sure the NHS across Scotland and across the whole of the UK is up to the challenge.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

the fixed point that assessors use to calculate values # moved back to .Business rates are currently based on valuations done in , before the oil and gas downturn, and transitional relief set up to mitigate the disparity between rateable and real values is set to expire at the end of this financial year.Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerceis now calling for a region-specic deal to reflect the extra challenges being faced by north-east firms.Shane Taylor, research and policy manager at AGCC, told the committee that business rates had been a #key challenge# for the region and the decision to delay the revaluation would present #some real challenges# locally.#I think there#s both a national and local north-east policy focus here,# he said. #The key one is understanding for retail, for hospitality, how the business rates relief will phase out.#Many in those sectors are looking towards what will potentially be quite a challenging Christmas and an unclear path after that in terms of the footfall challenges and working habit changes.#So the key focus there would be the government setting out very clearly what the path will be for rates at the next budget, what the path will be for rates relief, particularly for those key sectors that are most impacted.#And I think equally for the north-east more broadly, our view is, there#s a need to focus on a specic regional rates deal for this region as well because that delay in the revaluation means that the region is going to be facing rates which don#t reflect reality for a signicant additional period of time.#Some of the industries hardest hit by restrictions imposed by the Covid- pandemic, including hospitality, retail and live events, are also those with the largest business rates burden, and industry leaders fear the wrong move could put jobs at risk.Prior to last week#s vote, the AGCC attempted to put forward a compromise that would see the tone date moved to , to still take into account the impact of the pandemic, but with the revaluation date being kept to , so the north-east could have values #corrected in a reasonable amount of time#.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr Taylor said raising the issue is just the #first point# and the group intends to begin further discussions with ministers in the days and weeks ahead.#The transitional relief reflected the economic conditions and the hope that things would eventually improve,# he said.#We saw a bit of that with the recovery the region has had over the last few years off the back of the downturn but it#s still quite a precarious recovery.#Now we#re at the point where effectively we#re not quite back to square one but the region has gone through a very clear further economic clash and we#re not going to get those rates sorted in the next revaluation any earlier.#That means it will be three years, effectively, before the values get corrected.#Finance secretary Kate Forbes argued it would be “irresponsible” for the Scottish Government to proceed with  revaluation based on information at April , when Scotland was just one month into lockdown.Ms Forbes said the original plan would lock businesses into revaluations that did not reflect the impact of the pandemic.She added: “These regulations are based on an understanding of the risks to businesses which is, in turn, based on the most robust and veriable evidence and data that we have.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters unravelling our deep origins","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder. We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder.

We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The one thing we are not short of in Kintyre is cereal straw and once you#re set up, the biggest cost to growing mushrooms is boiling the kettle a few times.#My dad used to grow them and foraging for mushrooms was a regular thing for us. However, it#s vital you forage with an expertyou intend to eat them, as several ieties are poisonous.#In nature, mycelium connects all the elements of a forest and, with people having to isolate during the pandemic, I thought a shared interest could connect people again # we could take the form of metaphorical mycelium!#Ian approached Glenn Appleton from The Community Bureau charity and, between them, they created and gave away more than  grow-your-own mushroom bags.#When the pandemic is behind us, we are going to organise many more mushroom-related activities, from nature walks to art classes # the world is our oyster,# said Glenn, who is the charity#s chief executive officer and likes a pun. #If you come into our charity shop at  Longrow South, one word of warning: Ian will talk to you for hours about fungi and is being sent hundreds of mushroom photos that people take on their walks.#Katrina MacDonald was just one recipient of a grow-your-own bag, though for her, the medicinal properties of mushrooms were to become her main focus.#My dog Rogan was diagnosed with cancer and has been undertaking an intensive course of chemotherapy,# she explained. #The financial costs are so high, but as any dog-lover knows, a dog is family and worth every single penny.#After the chemotherapy, strengthening Rogan#s immune system is paramount and it appears extract of turkey tail mushroom may help him. I started a blog about Rogan#s journey and hopeful road to recovery and now he#s becoming a local hero with people stopping me in the street and asking about him.#Now comes the figurative mycelium part. After hearing from Katrina, Ian started looking for wild turkey tail mushroom and finally discovered some, growing on a log in a garden in Southend.He asked Frances Hill from Muneroy Tearoom whose house it was and she, in turn, asked the ownersome of the mushrooms could be harvested, explaining what it would be used for.The owners, Mark and Sadie, were only too happy for Ian to collect some, which he delivered to retired herbalist Kenneth Eames, who has been shielding for  months.Kenneth said: #I went on a mushroom hunt with Ian about  years ago and we#ve remained friends since. When he askedI could make Rogan a tincture, I was only too happy to help.#I came to Campbeltown  years ago and the people made me so welcome and since my we and I have been shielding, people have been as good as ever. I cannot tell you how pleased I am to provide some small help to Rogan.#People being connected and helping each another seems so apt.

Susan had been previously unaware of it and so decided to go find it with her husband.When they got there, the tide was helpfully out, revealing the pool. She took some photos and a film of it, but when she ed home and looked at the film, she felt sure she could see a ghostly image in the water of the pool.This led Susan to research images of Lady Helen Hall and she reckoned the image looked like her. Was it a ghostly apparition in the water or a trick of the light  Well, people can make their own mind up, but for me, Susanrsquos message made me curious to find this pool and learn more about Lady Hall, after which it is named.So we made it a family weekend trip of discovery, which usually take place within the boundaries of East Lothian even in the best of times so this was perfect. Bilsdean and nearby Dunglass are favourite places of mine, as you will knowyou read my column regularly. Despite the busy A passing through, the whole area has a fascinating history and the walk following the burn down Bilsdean Glen has an enchanting waterfall. Reaching this walk from the village is hazardous, however, as an unsafe crossing over the fast-flowing A is required, so much care is neededyou go this way.We didnrsquot have much time. The timetable of the tides was against us, as was the dying light of a winterrsquos afternoon. However, we managed to reach the beach with just enough light and time to have our adventure. Susan and David were waiting for us and we made our distanced greetings and they headed in front to seethe pool had been uncovered by the receding tide.This part of the coast is utterly fascinating. There is a lot of erosion here, and whenever I come I see new geological features and wonder about them. Irsquom no geologic expert, but Irsquom sure we spotted a chunk of ancient volcanic lava which seems to have solidied in mid flow a moment in Earthrsquos story from millions of years ago.It was from near here, of course, that the geologist James Hutton was taken in  by Sir James Hall, Lady Hallrsquos husband, on a boat ride to nearby Siccar Point, and the rest, as they say, is history.But it wasnrsquot to retell the story of already-well-known men from history that we made this trip. It was to discover a place associated with a woman who, despite her achievements and talents, was ignored by history, as most women have been until recently.It was indeed an adventure to find her pool, for we had to scramble over wet rocks to get there. Our young children took it in their stride and my youngest Lewis was looking out for evidence of dinosaurs. There are steps cut in the rocks nearby and so I suspect Lady Hall had a more convenient route to reach her pool, but we had no time to search for that.When we arrived at the pool, the tide was not fully out so it was still partly submerged, but enough was revealed of the cut rock to show the outline of Lady Hallrsquos Pool. I could just see what looked like the small steps cut by its side.Susan and David told me of the local tradition that she would come down to bathe in the sea water. Perhaps this was frowned upon, given it was the th century and she was a lady of high aristocratic status. But the story goes that her determination to regularly bathe in the sea led to the creation of this pool, which captures the sea as it goes out, making it a safer place to swim in this rocky coastline.I did not know of this pool before Susan contacted me, and I knew next to nothing about Lady Hall, she was just another aristocratic name. But now, as I stood on the edge of the pool which bears her name, I became intrigued as I listened to the story.I saw no ghostly image of Lady Hall in the water, yet I felt her presence in the twilight. The sun had already vanished from the sky and a beautul moon was rising above the sea. It was cold but calm a perfect moment for a ghostly introduction. While I had not seen Lady Hall with my eyes, I now felt we had been introduced by her story, thanks to Susan.We chatted on ourabout stories and the importance of enchantment and magic when growing up. Susan and her husband had given my family a winterrsquos afternoon of discovery and adventure. Two-hundred years separate Susan and Lady Helen Hall, but there was a connection between them. Two remarkable women from the area who shared a love of the landscape and the stories itrsquos steeped in.And now I must source the book Lady Hall ndash Lang-heidit Lady, written by another local woman, Sally Wilson. She spent years researching the le of Lady Hall and, based on the titbits Irsquove managed to see, it looks fascinating.But I will alsoto the pool. There may be other stories attached to it, and now our story is part of it too. We plan toin the summer, when the tide is out, and have a swim.That is,the ghost of Lady Hall isnrsquot in it already!"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-1-4-1995-1970-1920","story":"A FAMILY managed to get to safety following an early-morning fire in their home, reported the East Lothian Courier on December , .A teenager rescued his family from their smoke-logged home in Tranent in the early hours of Tuesday morning as fire raged in their lounge.Gareth Johnston, , stopped his terried sister Kerry, , from leaping out of the bedroom window and led her and his mum Jackie to safety with clothes thrown over their heads as protection against the fumes.When the family had escaped down the narrow stairway and were out of their home in Farsquoside Crescent, Gareth ed to save Gem, their pet Jack Russell, who was trapped in the kitchen at the back of the house.Yesterday , Jackie spoke of the familyrsquos ordeal and said that they probably owed their lives to Garethrsquos prompt action.ldquoWe were lucky to escape, she said.EAST Lothian residents were happy about the scrapping of British Standard Time ndash a three-year experiment of the country staying on British Summer Time all year round ndash as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier on December , .Farmers and building workers in East Lothian heaved a sigh of relief this week when the decision toto Greenwich Mean Time was announced.Parents and schoolteachers too were equally jubilant about a change which will eliminate many road hazards for young children.The decision to reject British Standard Time after a three-year experimental period was the result of a free vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday.In its later stages, the debate was largely dominated by Scots members, most of whom were strongly opposed to its retention.lsquoWIVES Fall Outrsquo was a headline in The Haddingtonshire Courier on December , .In Haddington Sherf Court, on Friday, Ann Robertson or Black, we of John Black, miner, Prestonpans, was charged with having, on th October, in Pyperrsquos Wynd, assaulted Jessie Mackenzie or Moody, we of Robert Moody, miner.An agent, in tendering a plea of guilty, stated that the complainer had unjustly accused his client of having removed some clothes from a rope, and that this was the cause of the quarrel.The result was that she had given Mrs Moody a slap on the face.The Fiscal said he did not think the assault was of a serious nature, and, perhaps, as the agent had suggested, it might not be necessary to impose any penalty."},{"url":null,"title":"world-boxing-champion-josh-taylor-gets-engaged-danielle-murphy","story":"The undefeated star got down on one knee in front of his long-time girlfriend Danielle Murphy yesterdaywhile on a luxury yacht in Dubai.Danielle took to social media this morningto say: ldquo  , the day I said YES.ldquoOne of the best days of my le, Josh pulled out all the stops and I couldnrsquot have asked for a better day!ldquoThank you to everyone for the well wishes and love, Irsquom totally overwhelmed!ldquoItrsquos times like this that I wish heaven had a phone so I could phone big Jimmy [her late father] to tell him my best friend has made me the happiest girl on the planet.Josh, originally from Prestonpans but now living in Haddington, is the current holder of the WBA and IBF World Super Lightweight titles.The -year-old is expected to step into the ring with Jose Carlos Ramirez, who holds the WBC and WBO World Super Lightweight titles, in the spring for a unication bout.Josh also previously took gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in  before turning pro.He also posted on social media, saying: ldquoSo she just said yes.ldquoI finally plucked up the courage to ask my beautul girlfriend to be my we.

Take time to remember your pets as well. Cats and dogs love to see the bright lights and decorations. Kittens are particularly adept at scaling Christmas trees and pulling down tinsel. Pups love to tear at wrapping, so beware of your presents.Please be aware that there are some everyday substances which are probably more likely to be around at this time of year that can be extremely toxic to your pet. Every year at Dunedin Vets, we treat many pets which have been inadvertently poisoned and see some very distressed owners who feel so upset that they were unaware of the hazardous substance.ChocolateMost owners are aware that chocolate is toxic to pets and chocolate poisoning in dogs is the most common poisoning we see. Dogs are more likely to be involved than cats, who are less likely to eat chocolate, as its flavour is less appealing to them. Be aware, though, of some gourmet chocolates with sea salt which are attractive to cats.Chocolate contains a powerful stimulant called theobromine. This is a similar substance to caffeine. Just as caffeine is a stimulant, causing your heart to race and beat strongly, theobromine causes this to a much greater degree.The first signs that your dog has chocolate poisoningare vomiting and diarrhoea. If this occurs, they will probably feel much better and recover and not go on to suffer the full effects of the theobromine. If the dog digests the chocolate then the more serious signs occur. These include hyperactivity, high temperature and blood pressure, a fast heart rate and heartbeat irregularities. Some of these signs can occur within a few minutes of your dog devouring the chocolate. The darker the chocolate, the greater the concentration of theobromine and therefore the more rapid the onset of serious signs. Remember that chocolate cake and chocolate sweets are harmful, too, not just bars of chocolate. If you know your pet has eaten chocolate, contact your vet immediately.Vine fruits Fresh grapes and their dried ieties are toxic to pets even in small quantities. During the festive period, think about all the places where these fruits can be found: in the Christmas cake, Christmas pudding, mincemeat pies and black bun. The cooking process does not reduce the chance of poisoning.These fruits can initially cause gastro-intestinal upsets such as vomiting and diarrhoea. However,the grapes are digested then a toxin enters the body which can cause kidney failure. This is likely to occur a few days after the initial ingestion of the food. Your pet is likely to be quiet and lethargic. They may be unwilling to eat. They may be drinking lots or not drinking at all.If you suspect your pet has eaten grapes or similar and is showing any of these signs then take them to your vet immediately. Your pet is likely to be given intravenous fluids and have a blood sample taken to check how their kidneys are working. It is likely that your pet will need to be hospitalised for a few days on fluids and given supportive treatment to help the kidneys. Regular blood samples will be taken to ensure the kidneyis improving.Holly, ivy and mistletoeHolly, ivy and mistletoe are often found in Christmas decorations and wreaths, and are all toxic to our pets.Holly ingestion can cause vomiting but,digested and the poisons absorbed into the body, nerve problems can occur. These can include loss of balance and wobbliness, tremors and even fits and seizures.The whole of the ivy plant is toxiceaten but the leaves and berries are particularly toxic.A species commonly poisoned by ivy is the rabbit. They seem especially attracted to its leaves. Initially, the rabbit may show signs of lethargy, diarrhoea and reluctance to eat. As the toxins are absorbed into the body, neurological problems such as twitching, collapse, fitting and paralysis can occur.Mistletoe berries are toxic. The juice of the berries is an irritant and can cause sores and ulcers in the mouth. If the berries are swallowed and the toxin absorbed, seizures and death can occur. Only a few berries are enough to be lethal for a puppy.If you see your pet eating any of these plants, remove any traces from the mouth. Try to make your pet drink, especially in the case of mistletoe. Take your pet to your vet as soon as possible. Your pet is likely to be admitted for intravenous fluids and medication to stop seizures,this stage has been reached.These plants are extremely toxic and, evenrelatively small quantities are eaten, they are iniably fatal.Onions, garlic, etcOnions and other members of the allium family can be toxic to your pets. The alliums contain the chemical disulphide, which damages the red blood cells in domestic animals. Toxicity can occur by ingesting a lot of onion at once or taking in a small quantity over a period of time. Two slices of onion eaten every week by a dog can result in toxicity after a few months. Dogs like cooked onions so be aware of thisyou have prepared caramelised onions or similar.The toxic chemical causes red blood cells to break up, resulting in anaemia and an inability to carry oxygen around the body.Signs that your pet may have onion poisoning include weakness, depression and lethargy. They may be panting and breathless. They may have pale gums and a weak pulse, or collapse.Please contact your vet immediatelyyou suspect your pet has eaten onions.Your vet will blood sample your pet to check the degree and extent of the anaemia and red blood cell damage. Your pet will be given intravenous fluids and may even require a blood transfusion.Most cases of onion poisoning recover but intensive veterinary care and treatment is required.Macadamia nutsNuts of any type are a potential choking hazard for small animals. Macadamia nuts are just the right size for causing blockages in cats. They are also toxic to both cats and dogs. Within a few hours of ingesting the nuts, lethargy, vomiting and an increase in body temperature can occur. This can progress as the nut toxin affects dferent organs of the body. There may be neurological signs, with weakness, wobbliness or tremors. There may be lameness and stf joints. Eventually, the animal may collapse.Again, contact your vetyou know your pet has ingested a macadamia nut. They will require supportive treatment and monitoring and hopefully will recover.In cats, where the nut has caused an obstruction, surgery may be required to remove the offending item from the intestines."},{"url":null,"title":"preston-lodge-high-school-supporting-need-christmas","story":"One of the appeals has seen the school organise its annual lsquoreverse Advent calendarrsquo.Typically,

A small group of us gatherin the delectable converted barn, whipping up chocolate silk pies with pear and caramel, cherry crumble blondies and the best carrot cake Ive ever tasted. Here are some of the things I learned on the way.... If your cake batter curdles - or any mixture splits when using fat, pop it over a bain-marieand whisk vigorously. If youre using a KitchenAid, warm the bowl with a blow torch, and then whisk. Do this quickly though - you dont want your mixture lurking over the hot water for too long.. When putting pastry in the fridge, flatten it into a disk, rather than balling it into a boulder, so you dont have to turn a big ball into a flat disk later.. If your pastry shrinks in the oven, it means youve overworked it. Start again!. Use a toothbrush to create pretty splashes when youre icing a cake.. Roast damsons in the oven and use them to make jam. The stones squeeze out easily after being roasted, and you can use the juice in your cake frosting .. Use a hot kne to slice your cakes up - this works especially well for fridge-cooled gooey brownies. Warm your kne up by dipping it in hot water.. To stop an icing-sugar dust cloud, mix the butter and icing sugar with the paddle by hand, pressing it down, before turning your mixer on.. Use egg yolk, a tiny splash of water and a pinch of salt for the perfect egg wash.. Use acrylic rods when rolling out pastry to ensure its the perfect thickness all the way through.. Always leave scone dough to rest - it takes  mins for the baking powder to get to work, to relax the gluten and give you soft, pillowy scones.. Weigh your liquid ingredients - jug measurements arent always right.. When you make pastry or dough, mix it in your mixer to start with, but bring it together by hand for a perfectly smooth consistency.. When making sweet pastry, use sugar not icing sugar. Icing sugar can make the pastry rubbery.. Use white sugar when making caramel, not golden, because its more refined, so there are fewer bits in it that might crystallise.. Use rice for blind baking, not baking beans - its cheaper!. When making carrot cake , grate your carrots into a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess water. Sprinkle a bit of sugar on the grated carrot to help absorb even more.. Use paperclips to secure your baking paper to the pans - this stops it blowing around in a fan oven.. If your pastry breaks when you roll it out, simply give it a very quick knead, then put plenty of flour down and roll it out again. Have a pastry brush on hand to dust off any excess flour.. Le is too short to make your own puff pastry. Use ready-rolled, so long as its all-butter.For more information on John Whaites Kitchen, or to book a cookery course, visit johnwhaiteskitchen."},{"url":null,"title":"five-things-stairways-heaven","story":"Whaligoe Steps, CaithnessIt was women who used to do most of the hard work of lugging creels up and down the clf-side zig-zag of between  and  steps to the Whaligoe Haven, Scotlandrsquos least accessible harbour.

But they still make an impression, as they rise up from the river Kelvin, curving round what looks like a castle wall, complete with columns, arrow slits and a mysterious door.

A gt from John Lennon to the workers of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, who were waging a work-in.Jimmy Reid had made his impromptu speech the week before. You know the one. The speech that sent a current through the crowd: ldquoWe are taking over these yards because we refuse to accept that faceless men, or any group of men can take decisions that affect our livelihoods with impunity.Forty years ago tomorrow John Lennon was killed in New York. But therersquos another link between Lennon and Jimmy Reid. An unknown one.While transcribing hours of recordings with Jimmy for a planned book, that link resurfaced last week. Irsquod worked with him on his magazine, Seven Days, in June . Later that year we got down to work on a full-scale autobiography. The interviews flourished into fascinating reflections from a man whorsquod walked with history.Viewers of the documentary Imagine will recall an encounter between Lennon and American cartoonist Al Capp. It occurred during the bed-in for peace with Yoko Ono in . Capprsquos visit wasnrsquot exactly an exercise in solidarity. In fact, the ldquodebate made the Ali-Frazer fight look like a warm bath. If Capp considered the bed-in a plaything of self-publicists he wasnrsquot above playing to the camera himself. Intermittently witty, he swerves from theatrical snarls to ungallant slurs against Yoko. Lennon responded in kind.Jimmy Reidrsquos own encounter with Capp, at the American Embassy in November , was part of a World in Action special on Nixonrsquos re-election. Jimmy had admired his Lirsquol Abner cartoon strip as a kid. This was because as a young illustrator Capprsquos strip extolled the virtues of the New Deal. His targets  Wall Street wheeler dealers, robber barons, and Tammany Hall politicos.Now, however, Capp approached him wearing a Nixon badge. A sight so incongruous Jimmy mustrsquove wonderedreality-altering fumes were pouring out of the embassyrsquos wallpaper. Jimmyrsquos reputation preceded him. Chomping a cigar Capp railed against him for ldquoDestroying the England of Nelson and Churchill. A lively debate ensued. But in style and manner it was very dferent from the Lennon altercation.Lennon, after his heavyweight bout, referred to his fellow-combatant as ldquoAl Crapp, and, therersquos a theory his song When Yoursquore Crippled Inside was written about Capp, who was fitted with a prosthetic leg after a childhood accident. An example of Lennon nursing his wrath to keep it warm Jimmy, with his customary grace, sought common ground with Capp. Although hersquod recast himself as the scourge of student protests back home, Jimmy recognised Capp as a man whorsquod marched with Martin Luther King. Perhaps his volte face wasnrsquot so much ideological as generational. A desperate defence of a past long since vanished. Capp had grown up in the s, and struggled to understand a changing society, particularly on the campuses of the s and s.Although Jimmy believed the day the music died was when Count Basie vacated the hit parade, he never stopped encouraging young people to ldquostorm the heavens. His altruism recognised that change wasnrsquot only inevitable but desirable. Embracing the new helped build a Jerusalem here on Earth. Not utopia, but a society where human potential flourished.The Jimmy Reid I knew personied a joyous humanity. His kindness and decency werenrsquot a ploy to win public approval, but formed the core of his character.Imagine that became a trend Brian McGeachan is an author and playwright"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  The loss of BiFab is a national humiliation","story":"BiFab should have had just the right skills and know-how to move into the renewable energy age by building turbine jackets for the wind farms that are bristling around Scotlands coast. But it was not to be.Last week, the Scottish Government effectively signed BiFabs death warrant. This in the very week that Boris Johnson announced a dramatic further increase in targets for the reduction of UK emissions, most of which will be achieved through offshore wind.:Over poundm of taxpayers money face being lost as ministers rule out nationalisation of collapsed BiFabSo much for the green jobs revolution. Scotlands major hope for getting a poundbn slice of the renewable energy action has gone south.This is a major political scandal, and rightly condemned by a vote of the Scottish Parliament last week. BiFab has not one but two major windfarms on its very Fe doorstep: the Seagreen array off Angus and Neart na Goailthe . These poundbn projects together had contracts out for at least  full Methil jackets.It beggars belief that BiFab was unable to get any of this work, despite a poundm bung to its Canadian owners JV Driver.Instead, the French state-owned energy giant, EDF, will build them mostly in Asian yards and have them dragged , miles by diesel tugs.A jaunty-sounding Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Economy Secretary, told Good Morning Scotland that her hands were tied by Brussels competition rules. Too bad. Lessons to be learned etc.. But arent we supposed to be leaving the EU  Why would they have any say in the matter It would be ldquonaive, she replied, to believe that these state aid restrictions will not continue in some form. Well,so, why did the Scottish Government pony up so much cash in the first place If Scotland is the Saudi Arabia of renewables, BiFabs loss is surely a national humiliation. No other country would countenance such industrial defeatism, certainly not Norway which now has a substantial stake in renewables.The Scottish Government has merely acquired a track record for pouring public money into lost causes from Prestwick Airport to Ferguson Marine. This confirms that civil servants and politicians are just not very good at business. They dont understand it.They leap into action chasing favourable headlines by promising cash injections, only to stand aside thereafter as it gets burnt by private sector companies whorsquoll never turn away free money.What Scotland lacks is a coherent overall industrial strategy, or any industrial strategy. We hear homilies about building back better and making the economy work ldquofor people not profit instead of just making it work.The Scottish Government had the option of taking over BiFab at next to no cost, but declined on the basis that a nationalised BiFab would still be hamstrung by European competition rules.This is a reminder that however much SNP likes to talk left and talk green, at least when trying to enlist support at elections time, it is no more socialist than New Labour or even Boris Johnson.:Anger as part Scottish Government-owned BiFab files for administrationPerhaps less so, now that the Tory government has essentially taken half the British workforce onto the public payroll and borrowed more money faster than even Jeremy Corbyn intended.No one wants to live in a communist state, but we have the right to expect the Scottish Government to have an activist industrial policy that puts Scotland first.That may sound like Donald Trump, but he wasnt wrong about the need to challenge corporate globalisation and labour arbitrage ndash that is, companies exporting jobs to low-wage countries and destroying the domestic industrial base.Ms Hyslop lamented that Scotland couldnt compete with workers being paid pound. an hour in China or Indonesia. But it beggars belief that Scotland couldnt secure some guarantees from EDF that local, sustainable industry should be part of the supply chain. The Scottish Government has many planning powers and licenses these mega windfarms in the first place.Every year Nicola Sturgeon makes inflated promises abut a green jobs revolution. But delivery has been pretty dismal in the decade since ministers first started spouting this boosterist greenwash. As The Herald reported earlier this year, of the , direct green jobs promised back in , only , have actually materialised.We are now told therell be , new jobs in the great green rebuild. But where are they coming from  We may have % of Europes wind energy but it is being exploited by foreign state-owned companies, like EDF, employing workers in China, UAE, Indonesia ndash anywhere but Scotland. If the Scotland is incapable of exploiting our own environmental assets then people are going to ask: what is the point of leaving the UK What happened to the tidal power revolution in the Pentland Firth  That was what Alex Salmond was actually referring to when he first coined the phrase ldquoSaudi Arabia of Renewables ten years ago. The original Peterhead Carbon Capture and Storage project was going to use old mine shafts to sequester carbon dioxide. That was axed in  by the UK Government.Then there was Pelamis, which developed the first commercial wave power machine at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney. Gone. The UKs only wind turbine tower manufacturer, CS Wind in Campbeltown, effectively shut up shop in August.Few are aware that Scotland had one of Europes leading environmental bus manufacturers in Alexander Dennis in Falkirk ndash but not for much longer. The Scottish Government is very good at making bold pronouncements about net zero and banning petrol and diesel cars. But words are cheap.Where is the network of charging points for electric vehicles  What about replacing dirty diesel busses and trucks  Alexander Dennis designed clean hydrogen and electric buses, but has just axed  jobs.It rather looks asthe green jobs revolution is going to amount to more dodgy home insulation schemes, some trees, and a forest of green lobbyists surrounding shiny-bottom bureaucrats at interminable conferences on COP.We hear pious lectures from ministers about how we should be cycling and not using cars, while they travel around in their ministerial Lexuses. Local governments like Edinburgh are doing their best to reduce car journeys in the city through a campaign of permanent roadworks and guerilla pedestrianisation.Yet, bus travel has been declining fast, down % over the last  years, and that was before Covid. Until the pandemic, cycling was also in decline over the same period.Where is the smart public transport system with through ticketing and computerised, integrated rail and bus services  The only signicant urban transport investment recently was the ruinously expensive Edinburgh tram taking ldquohigh value folk from Princes Street to Edinburgh Airport.The Scottish Government will say that Scotland isnt an industrial powerhouse like America or China or UAE and cant just conjure dynamic world-beating industries out of thin air. Butthe nationalists cant deliver an industrial strategy that moves Scotland into the green age then their promises about an independent future may lack credibility.

It was Chekhov who is said to have maintained that a pistol hanging on the wall in act one should be fired at the end of act three sound advice for plays and short stories, no doubt, but a distinctly alarming prospect in real le.Chekhovrsquos point, however, was about eradicating the unnecessary. If only, in the real world, we could go back to act one and decide that certain bits of the storyrsquos set-up wonrsquot fit in with the happy ending we now have in mind, and tinker around with the original conditions.Alas, most things just drt along endlessly without a plot. But the talks between the UK and EU over our relationship after the transition period really will have a conclusion ndash though probably more like the end of a story arc in a never-ending soap opera than Charlton Heston spotting the half-buried Statue of Liberty.Hundreds of thousands of things will have to be hammered out or altered in the future, evensome sort of deal is announced this week. The same is true of the dramas in storeone isnrsquot reached. Itrsquos a real deadline nonetheless, and whatever happens, by next week people will be constructing all sorts of competing narratives to account for it.The UK Government will paint it as a triumph, naturally, or at least a plucky victory in the face of overwhelming adversity, whatever it is. If therersquos anything that could be, however implausibly, described as a deal, so will the EU. Everyone  will call it a cataclysm, a recipe for disaster, the worst of all possible worlds.Yet whatever story we tell about the point wersquove now reached, it will not follow on from any of the narratives we were expecting ndash like everything  that has happened since David Cameron decided he had no option but to offer a referendum. Itrsquos hard even to remember that itrsquos almost exactly a year since Boris Johnson won the election handsomely on a promise to ldquoget Brexit done.And while he has, after a fashion, it is clearly nothing like what was promised by the Leave side during the campaign ndash easiest deal ever, etc. Nor, however, has whatrsquos followed been much like what the Remain side predicted, either. There may have been meltdown, but it wasnrsquot Brexit that caused it.One big dference is that the tale of the UK and the EU is now almost exactly like any other foreign policy story. Everything is about the nitty-gritty of trade-offs : the economy, reciprocal rights, visa requirements and other boring stuff that comes up in the UKrsquos deals with Japan, Canada, New Zealand or anywhere . The great, mythic story of the EU and its manest destiny has been entirely forgotten. When was the last time you heard anybody talking about the ldquoinisibility of EU rulesor the inevitability of ldquoever greater union A few days ago, Peter Mandelson made the extraordinary admission that much of the responsibility for Britain being out of the EU on much harder terms than either side predicted lay with Remainers who tried to overturn the referendum result . Even Tony Blair has conceded that Brexit as a political argument ndashnot the wrangling about what happens afterwards ndash is over.The great pity of all this is that the option for which both arch-Europhiles and, judging by what they said back then, the leaders of the Leave campaign would probably have settled ndash something like EEA or Efta membership ndash is now a dead duck.Well, thatrsquos how the story turned out, evenit is clumsy scriptwriting ndash something we can blame not just on Lord Mandelson, but Theresa Mayrsquos moronic ldquored lines and the constantly changing demands of those, like Nigel Farage, for whom no Brexit would ever be hard enough. It may have been an unwelcome twist, but it wasnrsquot one that could be wished away or revised. Think of it as a bit like the moment in From Dusk Till Dawn when a fairly realistic crime film suddenly turns, with no warning at all, into a camp, blood-soaked vampire movie.As far as both sides of the English Channel are concerned, tidying up Brexit is now just one more thing on the list. Itrsquos not even all that firmly at the top of the list. The overwhelming reason for that is the Covid emergency.The apocalyptic warnings of Remainers about economic catastrophe now look pretty flimsy, since both the UK and EU are in the midst of much worse anyway. Covid has cost hundreds of times more than the worst predictions of Brexitrsquos impact. It may even concentrate both sides on finding mutually workable solutions, rather than preserving their own positions above all.The EU is more worried about keeping Poland and Hungary in line, and securing agreement on how much its southern members should pay towards dealing with coronavirus, than it is about the UKrsquos departure. The UK has spent so much that a total reconstruction of the economy is not just an aspiration, but a necessity. The issues in any EU deal are now aspects of domestic ones ndash restructuring, securing enough foreign workers, trying to maintain the Union, increasing trade and productivity ndash rather than the other way round.Most of us still hope for some kind of deal but itrsquos not now a question of no deal being better than a bad deal. Itrsquos that neither a bad deal or no deal seems like nearly as big a deal as it did this time last year."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12115695.jpg?type=article-full","title":"like-ebenezer-scrooge---australian-newspaper-called-first-ministers-response-royals-flouting-travel-ban","story":"A row erupted yesterday after the royals decided to come to Scotlanddespite warnings fromthe Scottish Government about the strict rules over crossing the Border.The First Minister on Monday said the Scottish Government knew the couple wanted to come by Royal Train as part of a nationwide tour thanking workers on the coronavirus frontline.She refused to endorse the visit amidst a row that it broke Covid rules and said the Government ldquomade sure the royals were aware ldquoof the restrictions in place in Scotland so that could inform both the decision and the planning of the visit.Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gethingcriticised William and Kates decision to travel to Wales as Covid cases rise, saying he would prefer itldquono-one was having unnecessary visitsMr Gething said he was not ldquoparticularly bothered or interested when asked during by BBC Radio rsquos Today programmehe thought the couple should still travel to Wales.But he said William and Katersquos visit, part of a national tour by royal train, should not be used by people as an ldquoexcuse to say they are ldquoconfused about coronavirus regulations.:Nicola Sturgeon says Royal household reminded of travel ban before William and Kate visitThe Australian, the only daily newspaper distributed nationally, whose editorial line has been described as centre-right, had a dferent interpretation of the events in reporting the row, describing the royals \"hearty dispensation of goodwill was interrupted by a bah-humbug\" from Nicola Sturgeon.It went on: \"In tones rivalling those of Ebenezer Scrooge in a Christmas Carol, Ms Sturgeon curtly reminded Prince William and Kate there were currently restrictions in place to try and control the spread of coronavirus, restricting travel in Scotland except for work purposes.\"Crossing the Scottish border was made illegal from the end of November and anyone caught entering or leaving Scotland without a reasonable excuse could be slapped with a pound fine.There are exceptions, including travel for work or to provide voluntary or charitable services, but only when this cannot be done from home.Royal sources said the trip was permitted under the work purposes exemption.The Royals arrived in Edinburgh on Monday morning to the sound of bagpipes serenading them with Christmas songs, before meeting workers at a Scottish Ambulance Service hub.The pair are attempting to spread festive cheer to frontline workers ahead of the Christmas holidays on their -hour train tour.

If that falls below a certain threshold then yes, we would terminate.ldquoIt is something we need to consider very carefully because a termination would result in potentially signicant setback in terms of offshore wind development.

From the northern isles’ perspective, we see it rather dferently. The pandemic has shown us what is possible for other people because so many people in my constituency are left bumping along on speeds that are less than  megabits per second.“I joined the st century just a couple of weeks ago, when I bought myself an iPhone , which has G capability. I speed tested it as I was coming up for the debate today. I got a speed test of  megabits per second download and  megabits per second upload. We have spoken for years about a digital ide, but that ide is now a chasm.“For Orkney and Shetland, the idea that internet speeds and access to the internet should be more than  times greater in SW than in KW,  and , and ZE,  and  illustrates the nature of the problem we face. It speaks eloquently about the failure. Simply leaving it to the private sector is what has produced the situation today.“My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross [Jamie Stone] asked “Who is responsible for this ” We have this constantly in Scotland: on the one hand, there is the provision made by the Scottish Government and, on the other, we have schemes funded by the UK Government. The dficulty is that neither of them gives us what we need.“This House legislated for a universal service in broadband. Constituents of mine get quotes from BT for that and they hear of £,, £, or £, for a broadband connection to get them to  megabits per second. If that is only available to people who have a spare £,, £, or £, lying around the house, it is hardly a universal service.“However, my constituents are also frustrated at the lack of certainty and community consultation we see from the R scheme of the Scottish Government. We still do not know what they are going to deliver and when we are going to get it. All the signs are that the problems that we have had—a service to be deployed in the isles that is designed in Edinburgh what people in Edinburgh think we can get and we need—are going to be there again. The most remote and the most economically fragile communities in my constituency still risk being left behind.“It should not be rocket science. Surely, with a bit of will, the Governments could speak to each other and do better than this.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Our expert scientists and clinicians worked tirelessly, around the clock, carefully, scientically, robustly and rigorously poring over hundreds of pages and tables of data, methodically reviewing the data.#Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases. They save millions of lives worldwide.#A #rolling review# of the vaccine — used to complete the assessment of a promising medicine or vaccine during a public health emergency in the shortest time possible — was started in October.This is done as the packages of data become available from ongoing studies on a staggered basis.Data from the laboratory pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality controls, product sampling and testing of the final vaccine, and the conditions for its safe supply and distribution, has been under assessment.Independent laboratory testing will also continue to take place to ensure every batch of the vaccine meets safety and quality standards.The UK Government has ordered  million doses of the vaccine — enough to vaccinate  million people — with two jabs required for an inidual to become fully vaccinated.However, the vaccine has to be stored at - degrees celsius — meaning there are logistical complexities in rolling out the vaccine on a mass scale.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: #It#s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.#First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed this morning#s news, describing it as #the best news in a long time#.She tweeted that the Scottish Government was ready to start its vaccination programme as soon as doses arrive.Everyone in Scotland over the age of  will be offered a vaccination — some .million people.Frontline health and social care staff, care home residents and staff, and all those aged  and over will be prioritised in the first wave of vaccine distribution, from December to February.Unpaid carers and personal assistants, and those delivering the vaccination programme, will also be prioritised before its wider rollout.The First Minister is due to begin her daily briefing at .pm where she is expected to announce further details.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality so quickly, including volunteers for the testing programme, deserve our profound gratitude. “However, attentions must now turn to the practicalities of distributing the vaccine to all corners of the country in what will surely be one of the largest public health exercises in history. It is vital that our islands are not left behind and that appropriate steps are taken to guarantee equal access to the vaccine.“The Pfizer vaccine requires freezer storage and that presents practical dficulties in our island and rural communities.  I was therefore pleased that the Health Secretary was able to give me a categoric assurance that freezer storage will indeed be available in the islands and that priority groups in Orkney will form part of the initial roll out.“Further details about how this process will work in practice, including how any subsequent vaccines might be incorporated in the programme, are obviously needed.

Sometimes wersquore playing musicians and other times wersquore a choir, at an event like this itrsquos better to have the band as you can hear it for miles.The Salvation Armyrsquos Regent Hall Band, based in Londonrsquos busy Oxford Street, played Hark The Herald Angels Sing and The First Noel for the royal family.Mrs Cotterill added: ldquoI did see the Queen mouthing some of the words ndash so that was nice.After the Queen had left, the remaining royals chatted to local volunteers and charity workers in a marquee where the guests were served mulled wine and a non-alcoholic punch and mince pies.Kate and William spoke to Sarah Cottle, , a head teacher of three maintained nurseries in Windsor and Maidenhead, and the duchess quizzed her about the royalrsquos recent landmark early years survey. vw,vw,px, px\"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle She said afterwards: ldquoShe askedIrsquod completed her survey, which put me on the spot a little and the duke said, lsquoDonrsquot put her on the spotrsquo and she laughed and said shersquod had to chide her parents to get them to fill it in.In contrast to the views of the Welsh and Scottish politicians, she added: ldquoItrsquos been great that the Cambridges have done this tour, nice to see them recognising the work schools have done.Kate wore five coats during their three-day tour and on the final day was seen sporting a pair of the Queenrsquos earrings.The couple began their last day by visiting Cardf Castle, where they met university students and heard about the mental health challenges they faced during the pandemic.As they chatted, William and Kate admitted they were struggling with Christmas plans, suggesting they had yet to decide who to spend the festive period with. vw,vw,px, px\"William and Kate meet students at Cardf Castle ldquoIt is so dficult, we are still trying to make plans. Itrsquos dficult to know what to do for the best, said the duke.At the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, William told NHS nurses ldquothere is light at the end of the tunnel as he praised them for their Covid- efforts.The duke and duchess also spoke about the ldquogood news as the first coronavirus vaccines were administered, and at Cleeve Court Care Home in Twerton, Bath, they paid tribute to the efforts of staff across the country.copy -.

If they are not there then we should know why, particularly with less than  days to go.“We know that funding is there for now, but we have yet to learn how long it will last, or how it will be used.#As we enter the final weeks of EU negotiations, farmers and crofters face potentially catastrophic market changes that will put their viability at risk. They deserve better than vague reassurances from the government.”Speaking on Radio  this week, Mr Eustice said a deal was still possible, arguing that at some point, as he saw it, there would be #an outbreak of common sense#.#EU membership comes at the cost of bad governance,# he told the BBC#s Nick Robinson.#The real prize of leaving the EU is to regain that ability to govern effectively.#..Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

There are still plenty of people in Skye and Raasay with Gaelic, and it can still be heard throughout the island.“Urgent work is required to save Gaelic, but as a living language it won’t be politicians, bureaucracy or tokenistic gestures that make the dference. Ultimately, it will be those people for whom it is the language of daily le that can reverse the decline.“I hope this summit will be a fruitful exercise in doing that.”Councillor Munro said: “It’s extremely important that Gaelic communities in Skye and Raasay have an opportunity to have their voices heard.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year..

As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CROFTING-SHEEP-1.jpg","title":"the rams are out to mark the start of the crofting","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWith most now looking ahead to the year-end celebrations and festive reflections, the shortened daylight hours of late autumn and winter actually mark the start of the crofting year, certainly for those whose main interest is livestock, which is the vast majority.This is the time when the rams go out with the ewes, everything bar breeding stock has more or less been sold and it’s time to hunker down for the long winter ahead.Sheep have a natural production cycle which fits the seasonal patterns. As the days shorten, they naturally come on “season” ready for the ram, so that their lambs hit the ground with the new flush of spring grass. Mother Nature never ceases to amaze.Cows, on the other hand, can breed all-year, with the same gestation period as humans, though most calve in or around the spring, for much the same reason as sheep.But late autumn is when you start with a blank canvas. The next few weeks and months are all about ensuring everything has enough feed and reserves to carry it through the cold and wet – but especially the wet.I’ve heard many an old-timer say that the cold and wind rarely bother the animals. It’s the wet that really has an impact, as the lack of a dry lying area just saps their reserves.The financial s from a few animals are just too low to justy expenditure on large sheds and then there’s the cost of bedding. In conversation with a mainland farmer, I happened to remark that it cost us in Lewis north of £ for a big bale of bedding straw, sometimes £. He was getting it at £. He was in no doubt that at these prices it was completely unsustainable to have cattle inside for anyof time.If it’s a crisp, frosty winter, the cattle aren’t much of a problem. But the incessant rain can become a depressing drudge as you constantly battle the mud and dampness. With most crofters having a full-time job, you can see why so many just concentrate on keeping a few sheep – they don’t poach the ground nearly as much and, for quite obvious reasons, require much less feeding.For my own part, I’ve noticed a huge improvement in the grazing and ground since introducing cattle and they’re also vital for accessing environmental funding streams aimed at increasing bioersity.When the better weather finally does come, they’re much less selective in their grazing, meaning they will consume a lot of the harsher grasses, leading to greater rejuvenation of sward. Their dung is an extremely proficient fertiliser that attracts a myriad of insects which, in turn, brings more birdle – a very important consideration in today’s environmentally-conscious times.It’s all pros and cons and weighing up what’s right for your own personal circumstances, time and available infrastructure.But, whatever, it’s crucial to get the winter maintenance regime right so the animals can get off to the best of possible starts and, with a bit of luck, we can settle down to the festivities in a relatively rested frame of mind, however muted the celebrations might all be this year.WHILE we look back on what has been the most tumultuous of years, I hope we don’t forget the massive extra volunteer effort that was needed to carry us through. It was rather gratying to see the best of selfless human endeavour coming through in the worst of crises.At one stage it looked like there would be no livestock sales in the islands. In the greater scheme of things it would hardly have been the worst of outcomes, but it would nevertheless have created huge logistical problems. Fortunately, it did not materialise.The commercial aspect on sale day is overseen by Dingwall and Highland Marts, in the case of Stornoway, Portree and Lochmaddy, and United Auctions in Lochboisdale and the Argyll islands. But it still requires a huge amount of volunteer effort at local level. Even in normal times it is a thankless task to ensure all the animals are in their correct pens and the sale keeps moving along efficiently.Considering social distancing rules and that livestock owners were not allowed to be present on sale day, it must have been all the more challenging this year. So a huge debt of gratitude is owed to all those who ensured the sales went ahead – and relatively smoothly into the bargain. The fact that the prices were so good was a bit of an extra boost, just when we all needed it most."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3514204.jpg--.jpg?1607091783000\n","title":"covid 19 vaccinations arrive in northern ireland","story":"Robin Swann has confirmed that the first batch of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid- vaccine has arrived into Northern Ireland.The initial consignment of almost , doses paves the way for vaccinations to commence from early next week, starting with vaccinator teams.Welcoming the arrival, the Health Minister said: “We have been anticipating this news for many months and it is hugely welcome to receive the first batch of the vaccine today.

To protect staff working in high risk areas for exposure To protect staff members at highest personal risk of morbidity and mortality.The exact timing of all plans will be subject to vaccine availability.The focus in the coming weeks will therefore include care home residents and staffhealth and social care staff working with patient groups at higher riskstaff working in higher risk settings staff who are themselves at increased personal risk due to being in extremely vulnerable high risk categories or having other defined clinical risk factors.In advance of the GP element of the programme starting, active consideration is being given to options for extending the programme to begin vaccinating over s in the community.A Departmental letter setting out the early deployment framework for the vaccine has been issued to Trusts.Seven Trust vaccination centres are being established for the staff vaccination process. The locations are: Belfast Trust – Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast South Eastern Trust – Ulster Hospital, Dundonald Southern Trust – South Lake Leisure Centre, Craigavon Northern Trust – Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Ballymena Western Trust - Foyle Arena, Londonderry, Omagh Leisure Centre, Omagh and Lakeside Leisure Centre, Enniskillen.Mobile vaccination teams operating from Trust centres will take the vaccine to residents and staff in care homes across Northern Ireland.Trust staff are working closely with care homes to ensure that arrangements are as safe and effective as possible.HSC Trusts will inform their staff who are in the early deployment groups and encourage them to book their vaccinations through a digital booking .Anyone who is pregnant or breast feeding, or who is planning to get pregnant in the next three months, is not advised to get the vaccine.The full roll-out of the vaccine is scheduled to continue until the summer of . Further population groups will be added to the programme on a phased basis, with priority given to age and other clinical vulnerability factors.Subject to the availability of a suitable vaccine, it is intended from early January  to expand roll-out of the programme through primary care led vaccination clinics.

Reflecting on their delayed wedding plans, Lauren, who is a professional wedding photographer, explained that the original idea was to reschedule their wedding for April  - but her diary quickly filled up with other couples reorganising their own weddings.We also said to ourselves, #What are we waiting for, we just want to get married#, so we decided to stick with a date in November that we had arranged when the original day was cancelled, she said.A stressful few months later and amid restrictions changing regularly, the couple eventually got their big day last week.Much to Jason#s surprise and delight, four fully kitted out leboat crew members representing the station, were waiting outside the Arcadia in Portrush following the ceremony to provide a socially distanced guard of honour to wish the couple well.We could only have  guests along with Jason, myself and our two children but we were able to set up a live stream that allowed everybody  who should have been there to watch, Lauren said. Everyone went to such efforts in getting dressed up for the occasion and to join us in the wedding virtually.She continued: When it was over, we went for takeaway coffee and sat on the harbour overlooking the leboat station. Then we went home, had a takeaway and had our first dance in the kitchen.With her husband on the leboat crew in Portrush, Lauren knows all too well how important it is for volunteers to have the right lesaving kit and personal protection equipment.I am very proud that Jason is a volunteer but I do also worry when the pager beeps and he is called out to save others who are in trouble, she said. There is always such a sense of relief when he helps to bring those in dficulty back to safety but also when he s home safely himself.From the moment I met Jason, the RNLI pager became a part of my le too. The leboat has always been in Jason#s blood and he comes from a long family line who have been involved in helping to save lives at sea for generations.Lauren urged people to donate to the RNLI#s Christmas appeal, while Jason added that any donation would make a huge dference to the charity as it provides lesaving services.The best Christmas gt RNLI volunteers like me can wish for is a kind donation to our Christmas appeal, he said.

Additionally, the number of people who are trialled or being trialled are comparable to a regular vaccine efficacy trial. Therefore, no corner has been cut on testing, evaluation and determining safety of the Covid- vaccine. The vaccine causes infertility autism etc.Most of vaccine-related side effects or complications are short-lived and appear within days of vaccination. The side-effects of Pfizer#s mRNA vaccine are mild and include fatigueand headachesafter the second dose. During the Pfizer vaccine trials in thousands of volunteers, no long-term disabilities such as infertility or autism were reported.The vaccine will give you Covid-.Most of the promising vaccine candidates including Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines only use a portion of the SARS-CoV- virus which by itself can#t cause disease. Therefore, none of the approved vaccines can give disease in vaccinated people. Instead, these vaccines protect people from getting severely sick who could otherwise end up in hospital or ICUs.I get my flu jab - I don#t need a Covid  vaccination as well.The flu jab can#t protect people from Covid- infection. Therefore, to safeguard from both diseases, two vaccines - each specically designed for flu and Covid- - are required. The flu jab is even more important this season due to possible increase in Covid- infection after the festive season in January and February. The vaccine is unsuitable for those with weakened immune systems or existing conditions.There are dferent kind of vaccines to do the same job - protection from infections. Some of these vaccines, particularly live attenuated vaccinesmay not be suitable for people how are on immune-suppressive drugs, chemotherapy or have immune compromising conditions. However, the currently rolled out Pfizer BioNtech vaccine is based on mRNA technology and can safely be applied in these vulnerable communities. The vaccine contains a microchip to track those who get it.This is a myth and there is no scientic backing to this misinformation. All vaccines carry genetic instruction of the virus so that these components of the virus can be presented to our immune system to establish immunity. After this immunity is established, the person is no longer susceptible to the virus and therefore will be safeguarded from severe form of the infection. These genetic instructions are only short-livedand thereafter these are removed through our body#s clearing mechanisms within days. Importantly, the virus genetic instructions in the vaccines are delivered to our cell cytoplasm whereas our DNA is in the nucleus. Therefore, integration of the vaccine encoded instructions can#t reach to nucleus and thus can#t permanently integrate to be tracked. The Pfizer vaccine is based on mRNA technology and RNA can#t be microchipped to DNA as these are not compatible. The vaccine will be used to control people through G cell phone towers.The vaccine contains components of the viruses to train our immune system and these molecules are only controlled by our body cellular and metabolic machinery. Therefore, G mobile phone signals can#t transmit the virus or reduce our defences to attract viruses.The mooted travel and hospitality passports are designed for the government to police people#s behaviour.We are dealing with a deadly virus that has killed more people in a single year than HIV, flu, Ebola did. Therefore, it is a personal, moral and administrative responsibility to ensure at least % coverage of the vaccine so that herd immunity through vaccination is achieved to break the transmission chain of the SARS-CoV-.If everyone  gets the vaccine, I don#t need to.With a % effective vaccine, we need to immunize  out of every  people in a population. This means there will be people within the community who can#t be vaccinated due to their medical complications. This poses a societal responsibility for everyone to take part in vaccination campaign. Herd immunity is a better solution. It would be better to get Covid-.Herd immunity is an established and probably ultimate solution getting out of Covid- pandemic. The question lies how we would achieve herd immunity - either through natural course of infection or through vaccination. In the former case, we will lose signicant lives, people will develop long Covid, and this expensive way of immunity might last only for a year which means the whole process needs to be started again multiple times. The vaccine-induced herd immunity is the safe, plausible and legitimate way out of this crisis. This vaccine has been rolled out too fast.It is true that the timeline for the Covid- vaccine from concept to reality has been in a short one-year time. However, this squeeze in time has been due to re-purposed technologies, cutting short administration, availability of funds and willingness of people to participate in clinical trials. Additionally, the number of people who have been trialled in safety and efficacy studies are comparable to participants in regular vaccine assessment process. Therefore, approval from regulatory bodies is an assurance for its safety and effectiveness. Why is there a vaccine for a disease with such a high survival rate The vast majority of people infected will survive and many will not even notice the clinical signs . However, people who are infected asymptomatically may pass the infection to people with underlying conditions. Finally, while we have learned a signicant number of facts about the virus, there are still fundamental questions that need illustration. For example, people developing #long covid# may become a norm in the long-term, necessitating the importance of vaccines to break the community spread of the virus.

I’ve never turned my back where there was a need I came across my entire le.”To date, the Co Down lottery winner, who was speaking publicly for the first time, said they have given away half of their fortune to others in the biggest ever Lottery giveaway, helping “thousands” of people, with Frances having lost count of “the number of times I’ve cried my eyes out” following a recipient’s response to her generosity.Frances dismissed suggestions that new found wealth could be as much a burden as a blessing.“This is just love and joy on a permanent basis,” she said.“How could this be a burden  It’s just like winning the lottery every day.”Yet, Frances, who suffers from a medical condition that has her destined for a wheelchair, is also all too aware that fabulous wealth can’t buy you everything.“My auntie told me I had Perthes’ disease as a kid,” she revealed.“When I was a baby I had a big metal frame around my hips my dad used to be able to pick me up with the back of the frame.“I just managed. I’ve always done plenty of sport but about  years ago my cruciate ligament went and all of a sudden the joints went so my mobility is really poor.”She told how she spent years “sitting on a chair, unable to go anywhere or do anything”.“I actually spent about three years in Northern Ireland sitting on a chair because I couldn’t really go anywhere or do anything,” she confided.“I had an operation the year before we won the lottery and it has got me back on my feet again for a bit but I will eventually not be able to walk so I’m preparing for that.”But Frances told the Belfastthat it’s not something that scares her at all.The mother of three daughters — Katrinaand twins Natalie and Fiona— added: “What can you do about it  You just have to get on with it.”She also revealed to this newspaper that her health condition was a factor in her choice of home. Although she had her heart set on a bungalow, estate agents insisted on showing her a castle and a -bed stately home which came with an entire village “somewhere in the north east” of England.But she’s perfectly happy in her current abode — “a five bedroom, brick-built house with good sized rooms and a couple of acres of garden” which she “found on the internet”.The Connollys’ generosity was especially appreciated during the ongoing pandemic.In Northern Ireland, the couple bought new sewing machines for charity workers who were making PPE during Covid, as well as sending food parcels to many sheltering alone.The pair also paid for hundreds of elderly patients in nursing homes to have iPads to Facetime their families — including Frances’ great aunt Sheila Graham — and for young carers to be able to learn from home.“Sheila’s home in Omagh was one of the ones that got tables to keep people from being isolated she was able to talk to my -year-old father Frank in Essex over Skype,” Frances said.Being filthy rich does, however, take some managing.“I get up at am so I can answer all the messages and emails people have sent me before I start a day’s work,” she said.“Then Paddy gets up and makes me my breakfast.”When asked what a multi-millionaire has for breakfast she replied: “Pancakes and pineapple juice this morning...”Frances, now based in Hartlepool, spent a lot of time in Northern Ireland in the pre-Covid days, and admitted that she always has got a buzz out of helping others.The businesswoman added that she has “been doing voluntary work since I was nine”.“Obviously I’m able to do it now on a much bigger scale and the buzz is bigger because you’re actually making a massive dference,” she said.Apart from splashing out on “some nice bits of jewellery” and “more clothes than I need” Frances admitted that she still looks for bargains.One of her most recent purchases was  bottles of Bollinger champagne for people working on the front line.“Patrick and I watched a programme on Monaco recently, and somebody spent £, on a single bottle of champagne,” Frances, who doesn’t drink alcohol, said.“I found a special offer on champagne for £ a bottle, and I’m saving them to hand out to people who deserve some gratitude.”In the meantime, her plans for  include doing a PhD in clinical psychology — and writing a book about her good fortune.Frances said that while money hasn’t changed her as a person, “it does change how you live”.“We’re living in a nicer house, driving nicer cars, I can make a shopping list and, miraculously, my PA just has everything in the fridge for me and it’d be absolutely amazing,” she said.“If I want to go and stay in a hotel I can just do that but it doesn’t change who you are.“We have come into money late. If you’d come to it when you’re young, you’d maybe let it change how you live a bit more.”Belfast Most ReadArmagh’s All-Ireland celebrations set to be probed by sports body as county denies IRA singingCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Department of Health reveals vaccine roll-out plans as a further  deaths reported NI company boss cleared of shoplting from Tesco as judge dismisses #nonsense# caseNorthern Ireland pubs will have right to refuse customers who haven#t had Covid jabFears NI online shoppers facing #tax# on parcels crossing Irish Sea from JanuaryLatest NewsEx-Glentoran physio Jonathan Cummins settles his claim for unfair sackingCoronavirus: Delight as the first vaccine is administered but public is urged to stay vigilantCovid vaccine myths debunked: an expert on the key issuesBoris Johnson to dine with EU chief in Brussels to try to find breakthroughResidents in East Belfast care home vaccinated for Covid,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

has found the Oxford Covid- vaccine has a good safety record and efficacy By Nina Massey, PA Science CorrespondentDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailOxford University’s Covid- vaccine “has a good safety record and efficacy” and could help control the pandemic, a scientist leading the study has said, as phase three data was published.Interim results from pooled studies show the vaccine was .% effective, on average, in preventing coronavirus after two doses were given.For people given two full doses of the jab in one study, the vaccine was .% effective.In a study where people received a half dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine was % effective.The overall efficacy of .% is based on , volunteers across the United Kingdom and Brazil, and combined across three groups of people vaccinated.But on a day when the NHS started rolling out the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine in older people, health staff and care home workers, the Oxford researchers said more detail is required on how effective their vaccine is in older adults.This comes after England’s deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam suggested people who cannot leave their homes may need to wait for the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine.Published in The Lancet, the study is the first set of Covid- vaccine data to undergo scientic peer-review.Data for the vaccine, which has been developed with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, has been submitted to the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyfor approval.Today we have published the interim analysis of the phase three trial and show that this new vaccine has a good safety record and efficacy against the coronavirusProfessor Andrew PollardProfessor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and chief investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, said: “Today we have published the interim analysis of the phase three trial and show that this new vaccine has a good safety record and efficacy against the coronavirus.“We are hugely grateful to our trial volunteers for working with us over the past eight months to bring us to this milestone.”Writing in The Lancet medical journal, the researchers said there were no admissions to hospital or severe disease in people receiving the vaccine.However, they said more detail is needed on how effective the vaccine is in older adults – those at most risk of severe Covid-.The data in The Lancet analysis was mostly restricted to people aged  and under, with work in older age groups still ongoing.Prof Pollard said: “Twenty per cent of the people in the trials are older adults, both in the UK and in Brazil.“But they were recruited later than the younger adults so they’ve had less time for cases to accrue in those age groups and for us to be able to measure an efficacy signal.“And remember, this is an interim analysis, where the data that we have at the moment are largely from younger adults.”He added: “And so, as we do further cuts of the data, we’ll have a lot more information about the other age groups.“I think it is important that we do generate some more data in those older adults over time.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ebde .ece AUTOCROP w

out there in populations here and around the world.“And personally I think we need to be completely agnostic about which vaccine is being used because we need multiple vaccines, as soon as possible.“Otherwise we’ll still be in this position in six months time.“Whereas now we are starting to get to a point with three vaccines showing efficacy of starting to get the pandemic behind us.“This is really can’t be a competition between developers, this has to be a competition against the virus.”However AstraZeneca’s Mene Pangalos said adults of all ages need to be vaccinated against

said that while five cases of Covid- occurred in people aged over , vaccine efficacy in older age groups could not be assessed at the moment as there were too few cases.Prof Pollard explained that most of the data were generated to support the two full doses, and thinks that will be the focus of the regulatory review.But he added that it would be up to the regulators to “look at the data and

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They mitigated ‘some early risks around the potential transmission of Covid’ to other parts of the hospital. Dr Kilgallen commended Ann Marie McIlmoyle who stepped in as a Ward Sister to manage Ward , and was supported by Infection Prevention and Control , estates and support services team. All  residents moved to a local care centre on December , she concluded. In March, health watchdog RQIA was made aware of a leak within Greenhaw’s plumbing system, affecting the hot water temperature and pressure to a number of bedrooms and sanitary accommodation in the home. googletag.cmd.push It was then discovered that the dangerous bacteria legionella was in the home, however, none of the residents had Legionnaires’ disease. The direction to temporarily move residents from the home came as a result of the ‘very major refurbishments’ required, according to an RQIA spokesperson. That includes the provision of sufficient handwashing facilities and reinstating water supplies to bedrooms which would make it very dficult to provide the necessary standard of care.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He is one of the first people to get the jab in the UK. At a Trust Board meeting on Thursday members were told that vaccinations are planned to start at the Foyle Arena on December  but that could be brought forward. Dr Bob Brown, Director of Primary Care and Older peoples services in the Western Trust,is one of the first vaccinators to be vaccinated from the Western Trust area. He said: “As the Executive Director of Nursing and given my responsibility for older people’s services, I felt it was important that I received my vaccine early so that I can become a peer vaccinator to support our team who are getting ready to deliver this vital vaccine to our fantastic health and social care staff who have worked tirelessly throughout the last ten months, and also for our care home residents and staff who have also been highly impacted by this virus. googletag.cmd.push While our thoughts continue to remain with those families who have experienced the loss of a loved one from COVID-, I would encourage all staff to avail of the vaccine as it becomes available to them, to protect themselves, their patients and their families.” The initial phase of the roll-out of the vaccination programme began today. The programme represents an unprecedented logistical exercise that will take many months to complete. Progress will depend on available supply across the UK and is dependent on production and delivery schedules. The timescale for the approval of further vaccines will be an important factor in the wider roll-out of the programme. googletag.cmd.push The exact timing of all plans will be subject to vaccine availability. The focus in the coming weeks will therefore include care home residents and staffhealth and social care staff working with patient groups at higher riskstaff working in higher risk settings staff who are themselves at increased personal risk due to being in extremely vulnerable high risk categories or having other defined clinical risk factors. In advance of the GP element of the programme starting, active consideration is being given to options for extending the programme to begin vaccinating over ’s in the community.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lynn, , made his championship debut in Derrys  defeat to Monaghan, after previously making his debut with a man of the match performance against Armagh in the McKenna Cup the previous season. He was the longest serving player in the Derry squad, ahead of current skipper Chrissy McKaigue and this news casts a shadow over the Greenlough mans inter-county future. Barring his cruciate injury last year, he missed just two games in all competitions for Derry in the last three seasons, the  qualier win in Waterford under Damian Barton and a league win over Wicklow under Damian McErlain two years later. googletag.cmd.push Recent speculation suggested Lynn had been dropped from the senior . Yesterday, without making any further comment, manager Rory Gallagher confirmed to the County Derry Post that the Greenlough man was no longer on the . Also, when contacted, Enda Lynn, chose not to make any comment on the matter. He is concentrating on fully getting over his knee injury that caused some concern during his clubs run to the intermediate title last season.

The Derry boss is hopeful defender Karl McKaigue will make anext season and that surgery on his Achilles injury went well. “We are hoping he will be back around March April but it is still very early days,” Gallagher said. “We know the type of character Karl is and he is a physio, so has an understanding of his body. Wed be hopeful, but well have to take it easy with him.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Breandaacuten McNally, from Greenlough, died last week and many tributes have been paid to him since. Fr Seamus OConnell told mourners at St Oliver Plunketts Church that the -year-old was a proud Greenlough man. “Brendy was quiet, good mannered, good looking and liked fun,” he said. “Brendy was born in Greenlough, baptised in Greenlough, went to school in Greenlough and played football with Greenlough boys. “Were celebrating the funeral mass of a Greenlough man, where he was well-respected and had fun.” Local GAA club, St Oliver Plunketts GAC, led the tributes paid to a sorely missed club man. googletag.cmd.push “Brendy as we all knew him liked nothing more than lining out for the wee reds on a Sunday afternoon and was a regular on the scoresheet for our reserve team too,” they said. “His passion and infectious smile will be sorely missed but never forgotten by all involved with Greenlough GAC. “We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the McNally and Downey family circles at this sad time.” The widespread nature of the tributes paid to Breandaacuten highlighted how many les he had touched throughout the world. Breandaacuten celebrating success with Wolfe Tones GAC, Melbourne. He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Mary’s Limavady and Limavady High School have been selected as part of a UK-wide programme which was announced in October. Testing will initially be offered to all staff and students in Years ,  and  across both schools. Rapid lateral flow tests will be used for the scheme, similar to those used in the recent Liverpool pilot scheme. The tests were recently criticised in a study published in The British Medical Journal, which raised concerns that the tests missed over % of cases. googletag.cmd.push The study warned the tests may give a  sense of reassurance. However, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Track and Trace, said the lateral flow tests could identy many cases of infection in people without symptoms. She told BBC Radio s Today programme that the tests were helping to diagnose tests that would otherwise go undetected. What we are doing here is case detection. We are not saying people do not have the diseasetheir test is negative, she said. We are trying to say [to people who test positive] You do have the disease and now we want you to go and isolate for  days. That is a whole dferent game-changer. googletag.cmd.push We are also very clear that until we get a much lower prevalence of disease in this country that we shouldnt be changing our behaviours, she added. Health Minister Robin Swann thanked the two schools for their particpation in the scheme. Work is progressing with a iety of local partners and experts on New Testing Interventionsfor a range of settings including this schools’ initiative, he said. “The learning arising from the NTIswill help us to better understand how new technologies can be implemented and extended more widely across settings. It is important to be aware that these NTIs are still at an early stage of development, and consequently these new tests must be rolled out with careful planning and evaluation.     “I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Limavady High School and StMary’s for their participation, and I would particularly like to thank the team in the Public Health Agency who have developed and are leading this NTI and colleagues in the Education Authority who continue to be instrumental in driving this important work forward.” Education Minister Peter Weir said the tests would cause minimum disruption to lessons. I welcome this initiative where pupils and staff, without symptoms, will be tested on a voluntary basis andI want to thank both schools for taking part, he said. The test will be supervised by trained staff and I expect there to be minimal disruption to lessons. Keeping our schools safe during the pandemic remains my top priority and I will continue to support schools in the months ahead.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Claus was operating in partnership with local company Specialist Joinery Group, who organised the fly-by, as well as ensuring all the pupils received a Christmas treat.

The competition is part of the Revival Festival being co-ordinated by Creggan Enterprises. As part of the festival, a scavenger hunt with a twist is also being staged. There are great prizes to be won in both competitions, which are running on the Revival Festival website – www.revivalfestival.net - from now until December . The lockdown restrictions kept many of us inside during , but the two contests will now allow people to revisit, and celebrate, our cityscape and local heritage safely. The ‘Treasure Trail’, which can also be completed at home, features  city landmarks - some old, some new, and some pictured from unusual angles - and asks you to identy them. googletag.cmd.push Raacuteth Moacuter manager Kevin Hippsley encouraged young people to get involved. “A few of these landmarks are fiendishly dficult so we have included a number of clues on the website, which should help,” said Mr Hippsley. The ‘Teenage Clicks’ Photo Competition asks participants to go out into their communities and capture three great images and send them in to: competition@teenageclicks.net. Winning entries will then been displayed in an exhibition and online. “We’re looking for imagination and creativity here,’ said Mr Hippsley. “Both these events are free to enter and a great fun for all the family.” The Revival Festival is supported by Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Community Festival Fund. googletag.cmd.push Other activities and materials are available from www.revivalfestival.net and www.teenageclicks.net for access or downloading.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Caragh.jpg","title":"Caragh eyes Euro dream  ","story":"DROMARA soccer sensation Caragh Hamilton was cheering on her Northern Ireland team-mates from the sidelines at Seaview last night.Northern Ireland needed to beat Faroe Islands to secure a place in the play-offs for the Womenrsquos European Championships in .The  year-old midfielder is out of action with a knee injury she picked up while playing for Glentoran in October, which meant she missed Northern Ireland - win over Belarus and was also ruled out of last nightrsquos crunch tie.Caraghrsquos career has been blighted with injuries ever since she burst on to the international scene in spectacular style.She was just  when she became the youngest player to represent Northern Ireland at senior level in  and played in a - draw away to Belgium in a Euro qualier.She had been spotted by then Northern Ireland manager Alfie Wylie while playing for the U- side and was invited to attend senior training sessions.In a recent interview Caragh said she was shocked when she named in the NI starting line-up for the first time.ldquoI donrsquot think it really struck me at the time how big an achievement it was, she said. ldquoYou have no fear at that age and you donrsquot overthink things. You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football.

Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm. It will be broadcast live on the RTE News Channel and also on the RTE Player International.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility. I have many memories of playing there under the guidance of Roy Briggs, Ken McCammon and many others, developing my love of the game. ldquoCricket is a great game educating young people especially in respect, fair play, how to win and lose with dignity and team spirit.ldquoDownpatrick Cricket Club, along with Saintfield and Dundrum, is also a great place for Down High cricketers to gain valuable experience and the opportunity to learn from more experienced cricketers.ldquoDownpatrick have also been very generous to Down High, allowing us access to nets when they were not available at school and I would add my encouragement to anyone in the area to become involved to help the club at this dficult time.For me, the Linehan family are synonymous with cricket in Downpatrick.Alfie and Hugh will remain heroes of mine always, while current club chairman Paul Linehan hopes thatanyone can assist to keep the club going they will contact him on   or email paul.k.linehan@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Drumaness.jpg","title":"Drumaness green space plans  ","story":"A NEW amenity area is to be created in Drumaness by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.An area known locally as the lsquoBack Fieldrsquo where a play park was located a number of years ago is to be redeveloped.The news has been welcomed by Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, who is pleased that a raised area made of bricks and concrete is to be flattened and reseeded with GAA and football posts and nets to be provided.The local politician, who has been lobbying for the work to be carried out, said it is now possible as the village has two play parks, explaining that the remnants of bricks and concrete at the back field can now be removed, with this particular work long over due. ldquoThe area will be flattened and seeded so it can be safely used, with a set of GAA and soccer nets provided, said Cllr Mason.ldquoWe all know how vital it is to get outside into the fresh air, especially our children during these unprecedented times.

Progress is at last being made, but the money required to finance the scheme is the final piece in the development jigsaw, he said.ldquoThis scheme is good news for the people of Ballynahinch and the wider district and what everyone is keen to see is a timetable for delivery.Cllr Walker said the bypass had been talked about for  years and was now literally within touching distance.He added: ldquoWhat we require is a definitive timetable and confirmation from the roads minister that the money to build the new road is there. The scheme is finally moving in the right direction and now is the time to commit the money to ensure its delivery.Cllr Terry Andrews also welcomed progress in the bypass which he said can make a signicant dference for not only Ballynahinch, but the wider East and South Down areas.Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, said people in Ballynahinch look forward to the delivery of the scheme, urging consideration be given to farmers whose land has ben set aside for  years to accommodate the planned bypass.ldquoThese farmers have been unable to do anything with these areas of land which will probably be vested. The situation they fund themselves in is not fair, he added.The Department for Infrastructurersquos network manager, James Kelly, said while a previous roads manager was minded to proceed with the Ballynahinch scheme, it did not reach the point of going ahead.He said there was now an opportunity for roads officials to refresh the schemersquos environmental assessments before presenting them to the minister again.Mr Kelly said with the scheme expected to cost between poundm and poundm,Mrs Mallon wishes for it to proceed, the bypass will have to enter a process where it will be competing for finance with other schemes.He added: ldquoWe cannot guarantee that the money will be available next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 New.jpg","title":"New bus at Knockevin Special School following £28k donation  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special School in Downpatrick has taken charge of a new bus thanks to the generosity of the Lordrsquos Taverners and the schoolrsquos parent staff association.The PSA donated pound, towards the cost of the new wheelchair accessible bus which was provided by the Lordrsquos Taverners, which provides support for people with disabilities.The bus was recently handed over to the school by PSA members, who will also fund its running costs.The PSA was formed in  when parents and staff came together to fund music therapy for the pupils which was no longer being funded by the relevant authorities.The associationrsquos goal is to support all of the pupils at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and Knockevin Early Years Centre in Dundrum.PSA chairperson Kelley OrsquoReilly said: ldquoSince we formed we have raised considerable amounts of money through ious events and projects, such as the Sparkle Project in , with our previous chairperson Paula Dillon at the helm, which saw the local community come together to raise money for the refurbishment of two sensory rooms and the hydrotherapy pool.ldquoWe smashed our target of pound, to raise a staggering amount of over pound, and we were able to provide the school with a bicycle track and new bikes.ldquoWe funded a Memory Tree, which the school had wanted for some considerable time, designed and constructed by local artist Kevin Killen, to remember pupils who passed away while attending Knockevin.Kelley added: ldquoWe also have recently agreed to fund the refurbishment of the soft play area in the Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities unit within the Downpatrick school site.

We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill said: ldquoThe Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end.ldquoWe have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice.ldquoA package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time.ldquoWe appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December.ldquoItrsquos important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable.

This again sends out the message that Mid Ulster District Council is a cold house for the Unionist minority.“It shows that their views are not taken into consideration. It is totally unacceptablethat there has been no response to my question at last month’s meeting.”Chair of the Council, Councillor Cathal Mallaghan said directors are available online to answer questions.At this point, Council’s acting Chief Executive, Adrian McCreesh said: “The Decade of Anniversaries was taken to the development committee on October .“It was a report that was very detailed and it was a hard earned process of a lot of consultation between our officers and a lot of members from two parties in particular.“That was subsequently ratied on October  by full council.”Mr McCreesh continued: “The Decade of Anniversaries was designed and put together with a view of meeting the requirements of the funders – the Community Relations Council and the National Lottery Heritage Fund, under the principles of remembering and support.“That is what the NI celebrations will be about and that is what the funding is going to shape.”Mr McCreesh also said a community support grant will be available to all interested parties across Mid Ulster.“I stand over the fact that no paper that I, or my officers, present to Mid Ulster Council can identy one group only.“Cllr Cutherbston asked for inidual discussion with my team, he is entitled to do that and I was delighted to facilitate that.“However, now is not the time to identy the actions of one group. There is a programme within that which will go out to the public and I would imagine multiple groups will want to apply from all over the district.“I would hope and expect the group Cllr Cuthbertson refers to will also be an applicant, that is how we do our business.“My role in all of this is to ensure we are consistent in our approach, trouble arises when criteria is applied inconsistently.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said “it was a bit rich” of Cllr Cuthbertson to make this accusation.“Essentially what has been put here isCouncil does not jump to the beck and call of a certain community group it is in the wrong,” said Cllr McPeake.“I think that would be a very dangerous precedent to start going down.“We are at a very early stage in this and are going down the route of best practice, taking an educational view and taking all perspectives into account.“That is the way it should be and the way it was previously.“I just think it is a bit rich but I am not surprised coming from the same councillor.“It is absolutely hypocriticalfor a member to be castigating this council because somehow, the Council is not acting to the whim of a certain community group.”In response, Cllr Cuthbertson said he would “not take any lectures about being hypocriticalfrom a Sinn Fein member” and reiterated his stance that it is not for an officer to decide what community feedback is included in a report.“Are we saying now that ratepayers in Mid Ulster have no say in any policy coming forward. Does community feedbackmean nothing,” asked Cllr Cuthbertson.“Is it now the case any consultation this Council does is simply a paper ticking exercise as community feedback means nothing ”The Council’s Chair described this suggestion as “rubbish” and “not the experience of any other member in this council.”Maghera author signs up top scriptwriter - read hereEditor’s messageThank you for reading this article.

When a bubble is formed it is fixed, and must not be changed or extended further at any point.bull Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, at a place of worship or an outdoor public place, but existing, more restrictive rules on hospitality and meeting in other venues will be maintained throughout this period.It is important that everyone respects and abides by the rules of each nation wherever they choose to spend the festive period.Where there are any iations in our approach, these will be communicated by each administration accordingly.Further guidance will be provided in due course.The winter holiday period is a time often spent with family and friends, with schools and offices closing and people travelling over the bank holidays.Many have already begun making their plans, and we are today providing clarity to help people make the right choices for them, and enjoy time with those closest to them while staying within the rules to protect us all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbbfcbfef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efebeacacab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
