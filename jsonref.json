But a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had yet to see any appreciable change in Russia\u0027s nuclear posture.As far-reaching Western sanctions on Russian banks and other institutions took hold, the ruble plummeted, and Russia\u0027s Central Bank scrambled to shore it up, as did Putin, signing a decree restricting foreign currency.But that did little to calm Russian fears. In Moscow, people lined up to withdraw cash as the sanctions threatened to drive up prices and reduce the standard of living for millions of ordinary Russians.In yet another blow to Russia\u0027s economy, oil giant Shell said it was pulling out of the country because of the invasion. It announced it will withdraw from its joint ventures with state-owned gas company Gazprom and other entities and end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project between Russia and Europe.The economic sanctions, ordered by the U.S. and other allies, were just one contributor to Russia\u0027s growing status as a pariah country.Russian airliners are banned from European airspace, Russian media is restricted in some countries, and some high-tech products can no longer be exported to the country. On Monday, in a major blow to a soccer-mad nation, Russian teams were suspended from all international soccer.In other developments:- The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said he will open an investigation soon into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.- Cyberattacks hit Ukrainian embassies around the world, and Russian media outlets.- The United States announced it is expelling 12 members of Russia\u0027s U.N. mission, accusing them of spying.The U.N. human rights chief said at least 102 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded - warning that figure is probably a vast undercount - and Ukraine\u0027s president said at least 16 children were among the dead.More than a half-million people have fled the country since the invasion, another U.N. official said, many of them going to Poland, Romania and Hungary.Among the refugees in Hungary was Maria Pavlushko, 24, an information technology project manager from a city west of Kyiv.

More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord miche%C3%A1l and mary lou see eye to eye never a good omen","story":"Students from the Royal Irish Academy of Music play the Ukrainian national anthem outside Leinster House. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillIt took the threat of a third world war for peace to break out between Micheál and Mary Lou, but even a small mercy is welcome in these monstrous times. The last time the Taoiseach and the Sinn Féin leader were in such accord Ireland was staring down the barrel of a pandemic. If catastrophe makes these two see eye to eye, maybe we’re good with the relative mundanity that accompanies their verbal warfare. There was a muted atmosphere in Leinster House afternoon when the Dáil resumed for the week. On one side of the foyer, four flags were arranged in a line on the marble floor, two on either side of a gilt-framed original copy of the Proclamation: the Irish and EU flags, the UN flag and the flag of Ukraine. Later in the afternoon the House was due to hear statements on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with more than three hours set aside for TDs to register their condemnation of megalomaniac Vladimir Putin and his barbarous military offensive on a neighbouring democratic country.But the chilling events unfolding on the other side of Europe could not be boxed off into one say-everything set-piece after the usual knockabout was done. From the opening round of Leaders’ Questions and on through the Order of Business and Questions to the Taoiseach, deputies could talk of little else. “What we are witnessing is scarcely believable,” said Micheál Martin, echoing what everyone else was feeling. “But it is very real to the people of Ukraine.” When he called Putin “a bully and a thug”, he did so with the full and unreserved backing of TDs from all sides. That same sense of unity and purpose did not make it across to Brussels, where two Irish MEPs voted against the European Parliament’s resolution condemning Russian aggression against Ukraine. Political half-doors Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, perpetually engrossed in a self-indulgent, left-wing ideological binge, seemed to side against reason, decency and humanity. The parliament voted to condemn Russia by 637 votes to 13. By contrast, in Leinster House there was still plenty of room for differences of opinion, but all speakers were well able to recognise what is right from what is wrong and what is good from what is incontrovertibly evil. People were shook. There are issues and questions around how Ireland will deal with the crisis in the weeks and months to come. Mary Lou McDonald, and Catherine Murphy of the Social Democrats, tentatively began to ask them on Tuesday. Questions about the imposition of further sanctions, how the State will look after the influx of refugees, how Russian money sloshing around the coffers in the IFSC can be frozen and how financial loopholes can be stitched shut.Suddenly discourse in Dáil Éireann starts to sound like it’s been taken from the pages of a cold war novel. TDs and the Taoiseach are discussing the presence of Russian agents living among us and it’s deadly serious. How many to expel? How many, if any, diplomats to keep? Russian embassyThis was one of those days when the word “unprecedented” could be bandied about any number of times. What about the staff in the Russian embassy? Catherine Murphy asked the Taoiseach if the Government has “identified spies” among them. He didn’t say. But as for Russian money resting in Dublin, Martin insisted the State would not go easy on the billionaires. “We have no interest, none, zero, in enabling any Russian oligarch or anyone who is part of the sanctions list, either to evade or avoid being fully accountable to that sanctions regime. We have no interest as a country in protecting anybody in that regard. I have to be crystal clear about that.”With the Dáil talking about oligarchs, there was talk in the chamber of trillions, a figure rarely heard when the ordinary finances of our entire nation is discussed. “The Central Bank has advised that total Russian assets held on December 31st, 2021, are estimated at €11.4 billion, or 0.3 per cent of total Irish fund assets of €3.8 trillion”, he said.People may talk about Londongrad across the water, but apparently there is no such place as Dublingrad over here. Although you wouldn’t want to bet the dacha on that, given the strained relationship many Irish financial institutions have had with the truth in recent years.As the day wore on, the time came for the “statements of support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.“February 24th, 2022, is a day that will live in infamy,” said the Minister for Foreign Affairs, borrowing Franklin D Roosevelt’s famous line uttered after the bombing of Pearl Harbour. Simon Coveney opened the session by saying the motion showed the support every political party and every TD had for Ukraine. “This is Putin’s war,” said Minister for Justice Helen McEntee. “It is an act of an autocratic and dangerous bully.”Less filler, more passionThe speeches continued for more than three hours. In Leinster House, TDs often, after demanding more time discuss a burning issue, run out of speakers and steam well before the cut-off point. In this case, confronted by such a gut-wrenching and compelling subject, deputies spoke over and above the allotted time, with much less filler and far more passion. Talk has to be done, but at times, listening to the very concerned and genuinely angry contributions from deputies, that old chestnut of the Skibbereen Eagle newspaper keeping its eye on the tsar came to mind. But talk they must and, to a woman and man, they did, and as they talked a group of orchestral students from the nearby Royal College of Music assembled with their instruments outside the gates on Kildare Street and prepared to pay philharmonic tribute to Ukraine and its besieged people. About 30 students unfolded their collapsible chairs and assembled their music stands and played the Ukrainian national anthem. People stopped to listen, and politicians came out to hear them. The music was beautiful and it was a desperately sad but lovely occasion. A man by the railings waved a Ukrainian flag and sang quietly. Two younger men, also from Ukraine, sang with pride. Their eyes were brimming with tears, but they were not alone. Nobody spoke much because, well, we didn’t want to cry.In English, this is some of what the distraught and heart-broken Ukrainians sang:Ukraine is not yet dead, nor its glory and freedom,Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,and we, too, brothers, we’ll live happily in our land.

But maybe their amorality is really going to begin to bite their reputations in a way that will be uncomfortable.”‘A coalition of the woeful’He added: “How on earth have we allowed this to happen? A free press should be intimidating kleptocrats and criminals. Why have we got to the position in our society, a free society, where we have kleptocrats and criminals and oligarchs intimidating a free media?“We have a coalition, not of the willing but of the woeful. Oligarchs, Putin’s henchmen, teaming up with amoral lawyers.”The various claims made against Belton and the publisher had threatened to make it the most expensive defamation case in British legal history. They were all settled out of court.Mr Kelly from Harbottle \u0026amp Lewis represented Roman Abramovich, who sued for defamation and received an apology over claims that he purchased Chelsea Football Club on Putin’s orders.Mr Tait represented state-controlled oil giant Rosneft. Hugh Tomlinson QC represented Mikhail Fridman, a Russian businessman and Petr Aven, the head of Russian lender Alfa-Bank.Ms Proudler represented Major Pavel Karpov, a retired police officer at Putin\u0027s Ministry of the Interior, who sued British businessman Bill Browder for libel over his campaign for justice for whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who was murdered in prison in 2009.UK legal system being abused Mr Seely accused legal firms of setting up a “one-stop corruption shop” that offered “a form of legalised intimidation” used to silence their rivals, journalists and authors.He also warned that “an unstructured and unregulated private eye business” was now collecting kompromat on people in the UK.“People have the right to advice and legal representation but they are abusing it very, very badly in our society at the moment,” he added.His comments come after Labour MP Ben Bradshaw said lawyers working on behalf of oligarchs should be named and shamed.More from NewsBritish father posts on social media about travelling to Ukraine to \u0026#39rescue\u0026#39 wife and sonTeenage girl seriously injured in shooting in LiverpoolLondoners still suffering fallout from Tube strike as many lines remain suspendedRussia-Ukraine latest news: Deadly attack as airborne troops land in KharkivThe Kremlin won\u0026#39t admit that it has already lostLatest pictures from Ukraine: Fighting intensifies as Russian column bears down on KyivMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"southend on sea nine things might not know britains newest city","story":"The brutal killing of a member of parliament is a strange context for a momentous municipal decision such as turning a large town into a city. In Southend-on-Sea, that is exactly what has happened in the wake of the murder of Southend West MP, Sir David Amess in October 2021. The awarding of city status was a long-term campaign for Amess, and in the chamber of Southend’s Civic Centre today – where Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, presented the letters patent that set in motion the change from town to city – more than one councillor said Amess had “built this city”. In truth, Southend – described as “a mixture of river rawness and sleazy elegance” in Paul Theroux’s The Kingdom By The Sea – belongs to its people, largely migrants from London and much further afield over the past 150 years. After the dawn of the railways in the second half of the 19th century, Southend became the final destination for all Cockneys on a bank holiday Monday – many of our ancestors never made it on the train back home, deciding instead to put down roots and build the place we see today.1. What’s in a name?  Southend is really South End, the old name for the coastal part of what used to be the greater settlement of Prittlewell, the old parish that faded into obscurity as its southern resort boomed. The Prittlewell Prince find – the earliest dated Christian Anglo-Saxon princely burial in the country, likened to the discovery of Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb – was chanced upon in 2003 during the widening of the A1159 road, next to the Aldi. 2. Royal ‘irregularities’Southend’s Royal Terrace was merely The Terrace until the visit of Princess Caroline of Wales, who occupied numbers 7, 8 and 9 for three months in 1803. She came to Southend to seek respite from her doomed marriage to the Prince Regent, later George IV. At an inquiry instigated by her husband in 1806, in an attempt to ruin her, it was stated that “irregularities” had occurred at Southend.3. Pier pressureThe 1.33-mile-long Southend Pier was built in 1830 for paddlesteamers to bring trippers to and from this burgeoning Essex town, so they wouldn’t be beached closer to the shoreline at low tide. It was the work of local entrepreneurs, suggests local historian Jim Worsdale, who were “frustrated and annoyed that passing trade was doing exactly that: passing Southend on new-fangled passenger-carrying steamers”. If you turned the pier on its side it would be the tallest building on earth by some distance. Not that you would.4. Cockney days outSouthend was a dreamland for the Cockney escapee. In 1901, the writer Walter Besant described the mass exodus on Whitsun bank holiday in the late Victorian era: “Above all, at Southend he will find all the delights that endear the seaside to him there is the tea with shrimps – countless shrimps, quarts and gallons of shrimps he is among his own kind there is no one to scoff when, to the music of the concertina, he takes out his companion to dance in the road he sings his music hall ditties unchecked he bawls the cry of the day, and it is counted unto him for infinite humour.”5. Most amusingIn the same year, The Kursaal was built by a businessman from Gravesend. One of the world’s first amusement parks, it remained the largest in the south of England for most of the 20th century. In 1908, Princess Dinibolu of Senegal made headlines around the world for entering the park’s beauty contest. I was once told on good authority that a young Helen Mirren worked at the Kursaal, on a ride called the Skid.6. Sarfend snobberyLocal businessmen fretted about Southend’s ‘excursionists’, as lower-class Cockney tourists were known, threatening the tranquility of the better-heeled inhabitants and middle-class ‘visitors’ of Southend. In 1907, one wrote an open letter to his townspeople, suggesting they rebrand as ‘Thamesmouth’. “How many people know Southend? And how many of them are ashamed of the acquaintance?” he wrote, “It has been so long associated as “Sarfend” where the trippers go to eat cockles and shrimps.” 7. Odds and sodsMuch of the land around Southend was used for brickfields to build London. You can see it from the preponderance of ‘odds and sods’ walls around the area, made of burnt and misshapen bricks taken from the kiln. But after Cockneys fell in love with the sea air (or just with the fact they could breathe it without choking) many swapped London renting for ownership of a modest plot on which to build a low-cost bungalow, leading to the densely populated stretch of suburbs from Shoeburyness to Hadleigh. 8. ‘You all support West Ham!’The site of Southend United’s ground, Roots Hall was used as a quarry that fuelled the housing boom, before it was converted into a football stadium. Away fans would chant “You all support West Ham!” at home games, knowing the area’s ided loyalties: you see West Ham pubs, flags and shirts all over Southend, reflecting the fact that so many of its inhabitants are former Eastenders.9. PoptasticPop has been important in Southend since the 1950s, and the rise of The Paramounts (later Procol Harum) in the new coffee bars and basement clubs that boomed around the town. It is ‘the end’ of Billy Bragg’s 1977 opus, A13 Trunk Road To The Sea, that depicts the dual carriageway route for all Londoners to the Shangri-La of this new city. “I wanted to put the A13 on level pegging with Route 66,” he later said. “Growing up in Barking, that was the promised land, in quite a Springsteenish way. Later, when I saw where Springsteen is from, the New Jersey Turnpike, it did look a lot like Essex.”The Invention Of Essex by Tim Burrows will be published by Profile Books in 2023More from NewsLondoners still suffering fallout from Tube strike as many lines remain suspendedRussia-Ukraine latest news: Deadly attack as airborne troops land in KharkivThe Kremlin won\u0026#39t admit that it has already lostLatest pictures from Ukraine: Fighting intensifies as Russian column bears down on KyivUkrainian refugees escape on train with the lights switched off to hide from Russian shellingGovernment has ‘no idea’ how much its net zero plans will cost BritainMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"long week already stonehenge calendar suggests neolithic ancestors","story":"If the week already seems to be dragging, spare a thought for your Neolithic ancestors - who had 10 days to get through. A new appraisal of Stonehenge suggests the megalithic monument was a giant solar calendar that measured the turning of the year in 10-day weeks, beginning at the winter solstice.According to Professor Timothy Darvill, the eminent archaeologist, each upright sarsen stone in the main circle represents a single day. The entire group of 30, when complete, form a single month.Within the circle there is a significant fall in stone size every 11 days, suggesting the beginning of the week was also marked out in the monument.The stone circle would have been built to indicate special festival days and celebrations, such as New Year’s Day, on the winter solstice, when the sunset drops down into the centre gap of three stones - or trilithon - in the south-west. An extra five-day “intercalary” month was added in the run-up to New Year’s Day, to bring the total number of days to 365, which is represented by the five trilithons at the monument’s centre, Prof Darvill believes. Four station stones, which sit in a rectangular alignment outside the sarsen circle, would have been used to keep track of when to add a leap year. “Stonehenge was a monument in use for a long time, but when they came to the stone phase in around 2,500BC they built it in the form of a calendar system,” said Prof Davill, of the University of Bournemouth.“The proposed calendar works in a very straightforward way. Each of the 30 stones in the sarsen circle represents a day within a month, itself ided into three weeks each of 10 days.“Time and ceremony are very much intertwined. People have suggested a calendar would have helped farmers, but no farmer needs to be told when to harvest. This was about ceremony and gaining astrological control of the world by knowing what is going to happen, and when the sun is going to start moving. “The winter seems to be what it’s all about, when the sun sets beautifully between the crack in the south-western trilithon. That points to a key moment in the year. The sunrise on the summer solstice is good but it wasn’t the focus of things.”It was generally believed Stonehenge - which today is a major tourist attraction - was some kind of calendar, because it aligns precisely with the summer and winter solstices. But archaeologists were unsure how it worked, with experts at various times suggesting it was aligned on clock stars, lunar festivals or even eclipses. The clue to the latest explanation comes from the dating of the sarsen circle. Recent research has shown that Stonehenge’s sarsens were added during one phase of construction, around 2,500BC. They were sourced from the same area of the Marlborough Downs and subsequently remained in the same formation, indicating they worked as a single unit. Around the same period, similar 10-week calendars were being adopted in Egypt, raising the possibility that the idea was imported from the east. “There is no reason that it couldn’t have been invented in Britain, but it’s interesting that this happens just when a similar calendar is emerging elsewhere,” added Prof Darvill, whose hypothesis is published in the journal Antiquity.“This is a time when solar cults were emerging and we know that people were moving about a lot.” Although no monthly markers have yet been found, Prof Darvill believes they may have been looted or exist hidden in the surrounding landscape.However, other experts are more sceptical about the explanation.Mike Parker-Pearson, professor of British later prehistory at University College London, said: “It’s certainly intriguing but ultimately it fails to convince. The numbers don’t really add up – why should two uprights of a trilithon equal one upright of the sarsen circle to represent one day?”“As for inspiration from ancient Egypt, the evidence just isn’t there.”More from NewsBritish father posts on social media about travelling to Ukraine to \u0026#39rescue\u0026#39 wife and sonTeenage girl seriously injured in shooting in LiverpoolLondoners still suffering fallout from Tube strike as many lines remain suspendedRussia-Ukraine latest news: Deadly attack as airborne troops land in KharkivThe Kremlin won\u0026#39t admit that it has already lostLatest pictures from Ukraine: Fighting intensifies as Russian column bears down on KyivMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teaching grammar primary school children does not improve writing","story":"Teaching primary school children about grammar does not improve their ability to write, new research claims.The study of grammar at a young age is currently a crucial part of England’s national curriculum, but researchers have now discovered it does little to actually help children’s writing skills.And while the study found learning about grammar does provide some benefit to the construction of inidual sentences, it provides little to no benefit to what it calls “narrative writing”.Narrative writing in the study is defined as a series of sentences that are connected and could therefore be anything from a short story to a letter.The study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation and co-authored by researchers from University College London and the University of York, analysed 70 Year 2 teachers in 70 primary schools and 1,736 pupils.The team concluded that there were questions over whether it was in the children’s best interests to have such a large focus on grammar in the curriculum.Dominic Wyse, the study’s lead author and professor of early childhood and primary development at UCL, said: “The lack of impact of grammar teaching on pupils’ narrative writing raises questions about the extensive grammar specifications that are part of England’s national curriculum.“Currently, the content of England’s national curriculum requires children aged six to seven to be taught grammatical terms such as noun phrase, statement, command and tense.“Older primary school children have to learn terms such as subordinate clause, adverbial, modal verb, active and passive.”The study also looked at a more interactive approach to the study of grammar via an online platform called “Englicious” and while there were some “encouraging” results, they again found there was no statistical improvement in children’s writing ability.The children’s writing was tested via a narrative writing test and a sentence generation task.Speaking to The , Professor Wyse said he believed encouraging young children to simply sit down and write for longer periods could be more beneficial than teaching them “what a noun is”.He said: “My personal view is why do you need to be teaching young children what a noun is? Why do they need to know what the definition of a noun is? I just don’t think that is the most important thing to be doing at that age.“There are evidence-based approaches to teaching writing that have already been proven.“A really simple one is to just practise writing more, and by that I mean having opportunities to genuinely sit and write for extended periods.“Schooling can often be lots of exercises and children rarely get to plan and write at length.“They do of course get the opportunity to do that, in history lessons for example. But it would be ironic if, in their English lessons, they are not given the chance to write.”‘Good vocabulary, good imagination’In the 1960s, the focus on grammar was largely dropped from the curriculum and the priority was placed on “English Literature” – the idea being children would pick up the grammar as they went along.In 2014, the current curriculum was introduced by Michael Gove, then secretary of state for education, and a stronger emphasis was once again placed on the learning of grammar.Debra Myhill, Creative Writing director at the University of Exeter, said that in her view, the question of whether learning grammar at a young age was beneficial to writing was far more complex than the study seemed to suggest.She added: “Being a good writer does mean you need to spell accurately and have grammatical sentences but it also means you need good vocabulary, good imagination and you need to understand narrative structure.“No one single intervention can tackle all of those things at once.”In the UCL study’s conclusion, the authors wrote: “Knowledge about language is not entirely synonymous with grammar as currently conceived in England’s national curriculum.“National curriculum policy makers made selections of curriculum content to be covered based on prioritisation of certain kinds of knowledge at the expense of other kinds of knowledge.”The UCL study concluded that the curriculum should focus more on what helps children to develop their writing skills at different points in development, focusing on teaching approaches such as sentence-combining, planning and emphasising the processes of writing.Professor Wyse said that the national curriculum should reflect the evidence on the value of teaching grammar in classrooms. He added: “Until an in-depth review of England’s national curriculum is undertaken children are unlikely to be receiving the optimal evidence-based teaching of writing that they deserve.”‘Writing for enjoyment’Adrian Williams, a trustee for the Queen’s English Society, said that while learning grammar might not make children “better writers” it would ensure they wrote “correctly”.He said: “Let’s consider what we mean by ‘better’.“If we mean ‘more imaginatively, more powerfully, making a greater impact with what they write’, it seems unlikely that the learning of grammar will improve a child’s ability to write better.“Indeed the learning experience might well deter the child from writing for enjoyment at all.“If, by contrast, ‘better’ means ‘correctly’, it seems reasonable to expect that children who have been taught grammar and have learned the lesson will eventually begin to apply what they have been taught.“Then they will have the advantage that the people who read what they write will give their writing more respect.“Or, putting the case the other way round, people who write incorrectly will run the risk that their writing earns the scorn of their readers: potential employers, for example.”More from NewsBritish father posts on social media about travelling to Ukraine to \u0026#39rescue\u0026#39 wife and sonTeenage girl seriously injured in shooting in LiverpoolLondoners still suffering fallout from Tube strike as many lines remain suspendedRussia-Ukraine latest news: Deadly attack as airborne troops land in KharkivThe Kremlin won\u0026#39t admit that it has already lostLatest pictures from Ukraine: Fighting intensifies as Russian column bears down on KyivMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"alarming tv advert shows how","story":"Alarming TV advert shows how you can help stop sexual harassment in the streetMinisters hope it will lead to a lasting change in attitudes as impactful government campaigns have some done over the years with smoking and drink drivingthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video government-tv-ad-aims-tackle-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:YPZrTah,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The -second television ad shows examples of street harassment, coercive control, unwanted touching, workplace harassment, revenge-porn and cyber-flashing that women put up with daily. Ministers hope that it will lead to lasting change in attitudes as impactful government campaigns have some done over the years with smoking, drink, driving and wearing a seatbelt. Home Office minister Rachel Maclean told the Mirror: “The only way to make successful change is to keep repeating our message that violence against women and girls will not be tolerated anymore. We’re working to change attitudes and behaviours within society so people notice the signs.  We will not stop repeating enough is enough. We just have to keep sharing the message until attitudes finally change.” Payzee Mahmod, Child Marriage Survivor and IKWRO Campaigner, said: “I’m behind this strong campaign which importantly shows that everyone has a role to play in taking action to end violence against women and girls and ensuring that every woman and girl gets the support they need.” Some campaigners admitted the TV ad did not express the form of coercion and domestic abuse well enough, but admitted it would be hard to convey within a short timeframe. Although a number of academics were delighted the Government had taken a step in the right direction.Home Secretary Priti Patel said: “For too long, the responsibility of keeping safe has been placed on the shoulders of women and girls.This campaign says enough, and recognises it is on all of us to demand major societal change. Everyone has a stake in this. “Our new campaign shows that everyone can play a role in challenging abuse and making our country a safer place. “By accepting all of the recommendations in the HMICFRS report I commissioned last year, the Government and the police are doubling down to support victims and survivors and punish perpetrators.”  Andrea Simon, Director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition added: “We welcome this campaign to tackle male violence against women and girls. We can’t end this abuse without addressing the unacceptable attitudes and behaviours that minimise and normalise it. “The End Violence Against Women Coalition has called for a public campaign since , and it is clear that this type of campaign must be long-term, properly funded and shaped by specialist organisations including those led by and for Black and minoritised women.” As Ms Maclean spoke in front of the likes of the Home Secretary, campaigner Nimco Ali, Victims Commissioner Dame Vera Baird, Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs, Siobhan Baillie Tory MP for Stroud, and Shadow Victims Minister Anna McMorrin, MPs voted down plans to make misogyny a hate crime a short walk away in the Commons chamber. The Government has previously insisted the move will provide more harm than help. But Policing Minister Kit Malthouse was slammed in the Commons, accused of “ignoring women”. Labour MP Stella Creasy said during the debate on the controversial police and crime Bill: “If he continues to ignore women,he continues to say that he understands the challenge, to blame them for not coming forward and report things … he’s right to shake and thrash his head, but he can probably go home without looking over his shoulder.Many of us can’t.” A senior official told the Mirror it was quite ironic the Government were launching a campaign to protect violence against women and girls as MPs blocked a bill to make misogyny a hate crime. Earlier this week it was confirmed police would be told to give violence against women and girls the same priority as terrorism and organised crime. Ms Patel is to add the crime to the Strategic Policing Requirement which sets how resources are to be allocated by the  forces in England and Wales.  The Home Secretary’s move follows outrage at the horric murder of Sarah Everard, , abducted and killed almost a year ago by a serving officer as she walked home near London’s Clapham Common. Ms Patel said: “The safety of women and girls is an absolute priority and I do not accept that violence against them is inevitable.” The SPR sets out how Chief Constables and Police and Crime Commissioners should do their jobs and the priorities they must deliver on. Rachel Williams, a domestic abuse survivor was shot by her ex-husband Darren Williams after she asked him for a orce and her son Jack killed himself just six weeks later. She told the audience at the Commons reception: “Sadly through society, we reinforce the blame on the victim. We focus on the victim and not the person who did it, the perpetrator. Why does she keep going back  What was she wearing  Why did these women white women like this  One does she run  Or does she just leave ” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vera BairdHome OfficeCrimeDomestic violencePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Observers went home afterwards, while the troops lived in the fallout at Christmas Island for up to a year Image: MirrorpixopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Feb |commentsSeventy years ago this October, Britain detonated its first atomic bomb. The  further nuclear weapon trials ious governments conducted over decades are the reason why, today, Vladimir Putin probably isnapost going to irradiate the UK by teatime. And for the past  years, the servicemen who delivered our nuclear deterrent have been saying they got cancer as a result. That their wives miscarried repeatedly. That children were born with defects - deformities, poor plumbing, extra teeth.To every complaint, each government said the same: there is no evidence. Until Thursday morning, when, just as Putin rolled his tanks into Ukraine, officials published an update to a government study into the health of the nuclear test veterans.  Read the full story of Britainaposs nuclear tests at DAMNED And for the first time it said they were right. They are more likely to die and get cancer. Seven decades after developing a weapon always intended to be physically and genetically devastating to any living thing exposed to it, government scientists admitted that a long-term detrimental health effect associated with participation in the tests cannot be completely ruled out.It took a day to digest the -page report, packed with statistical tables, but the figure which jumped out was that test veterans were . times more likely to die from chronic myeloid leukaemia, a type of bone cancer that, the report says, is radiation-inducible. A further  pages of supplementary material establishes % of the crew of HMS Diana, a warship ordered twice to sail through fallout, had died, almost all from tumours. They show that RAF ground crew who washed down planes that had flown through the mushroom clouds were  times more likely to die from leukaemia. Read moreAnd, perhaps most devastatingly for all those governments which twisted reality and logic to deny these men the truth, suicide rates were excessive in every single decade since the tests began. But something wasnapost right. \" target\"_self\" rel\"nofollow\"This study began in , with updates in  and . They backed up the government line to such an extent veterans called them a cover-up and whitewash. The new one was ordered in , after the Mirror launched a medal campaign. The authors say the extra  years made it possible to study in more detail and with greater statistical certainty the potential lelong health impact of test participation. Yet on page , the report compares all this extra information with studies from before : reports which do not have that detail. How was it possible, we asked the researchers, to compare, when this is the first time weaposve seen it  We were told that the previous three reports were summary papers, and published alongside them at the same time were companion reports with extra data. Veterans, families, campaigners, lawyers, and war pension advocates were amazed. This was the first time they had been told the first  studies were summaries, and that there was anything extra. We asked when and where these companion reports were published. We were told they all have ISBN numbers, and were available from government agencies. And they were mentioned in the summaries.With the latest study, all  have now been put online. So we had a look at the first, which was only ever available previously in paper format. It was  pages long, and published in the British Medical Journal on January , . Nowhere within it does it state that there is extra detail in a companion report.What there is, is a footnote. It could be identied as the right reference only because it mentions a code also used on the front page of the companion report. This report could be found onlyyou already had it. This footnote is referenced in the paper just twice, and says merely that the companion report describes methodology and verication checks. There is no mention, whatsoever, of it containing DATA . But this extra information is eye-opening. Spread across  pages, it shows test veterans are . times more likely to die from leukaemia, . times more likely to die from bladder cancer, and raised rates of suicide. And thereaposs a table showing  test veterans dead from chronic myeloid leukaemia, compared to none in the control group, a statistically-signicant figure with a low rate of probability, which means men at the nuclear tests were  TIMES more likely to get a radiation-inducible bone cancer than anyone  in the population.A call to the Stationery Office established that not one copy of this companion report had even been published, not once in  years.  It is entirely possible, therefore, that you are one of the first people in the world to ever see what the British state has known for most of your le: that men ordered to take part in experiments weaponising radiation were more likely to die as a result.Despite knowing that, the state fought every war pension claim and court case. It issued denials to every Daily Mirror story. It sent ministers to the Despatch Box to say there was no evidence. It did it all using millions of pounds of taxpayersapos money - your money.Thousands of test veterans have died, uncompensated and unrecognised, because no-one told them about the companion reports. Hundreds of thousands of children have been born to parents who ask a doctor why, and the doctor just shrugs, because this data was hidden in the footnotes. Decades have rolled slowly by while whole families of men who served their country went in and out of hospital, lost jobs, lost faith, and grieved for those who took their own lives. Ministers were briefed by advisers, who read the reportaposs front page which blames smoking and says that, overall there was no detectable effect on health from the tests. Editors and defence reporters in a once-angry media listened to briefings from the MoD, and shrugged the story away. Read more Even veterans and lawyers, who pored over these documents, had no reason to think there was proof within them that radiation-linked bone cancer could be linked to explosions of plutonium isotopes that have been considered toxic and bone-seeking almost since their discovery. Yet here it is, hidden in the open, unpublished but publishable, something that has never existed in physical form and which can be seen only to those whoaposve seen it already. It takes a special level of deviousness to cover something up while at the same time covering your own arse to effectively hide something in a microdot, so that you can always say it was published at the time.It could be argued that the passage of time has made the test veteran data clearer, and the figures worse. As some of these illnesses are more common with age, there is a clearer comparison with the control group. But it is indisputable that at least those  men who died from radiogenic bone cancer within  years of the tests could have had a war pension from the moment they fell ill. Their widows,they were married, could have had a pension too they could have had faith. Instead they were denied even a medal by a state which puts itself above the people it serves.It would have cost us two things: a fraction of the money spent fighting the veterans, and the pride of an Establishment which is simply unable to admit it ever did wrong. Both would have been worth paying, and weaposd have a finer country for it. One which, perhaps, that would never have let a despot who puts radiation in a pot of tea be in a position to invade anywhere.

He told the nation: Throughout our history weaposve learned this lesson - when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising. He went on to highlight how Putin had turned away options to avoid war. Putinaposs war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldnapost respond. And, he thought he could ide us here at home, Biden said.  Putin was wrong. We are ready. Biden sought to unite Americans in solidarity with Ukraine in the speech while also focusing on his domestic economic agenda, including reintroducing elements of his stalled Build Back Better programme. He also confirmed that Russian planes would be banned from flying in US airspace.The war in Ukraine and high inflation at home are two of the biggest challenges facing his administration, in addition to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

MPs’ pay is set by IPSA, the independent watchdog set up in the wake of the MPs’ expenses scandal. The calculation is based on the average change in salaries for public sector workers in the last year. Labour leader Keir Starmer opposed the move when it was first suggested in January, and the Mirror understands his position has not changed. He said: “I think that MPs do not need a pay rise and we should all be saying that we don’t need that pay rise and it shouldn’t go ahead. “The mechanism is independent but I think it’s for me, as leader of the opposition, to say that I do not think we should have that pay rise.” And in January, Number  urged restraint from IPSA - given the pay rise will coincide with energy bills soaring for millions of families and a National Insurance hike tax for workers. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: “I would say that would we would expect restraint on matters like this given current circumstances but beyond that I think it is right that we let IPSA set out the proposals as an independent body.”  Askedthe PM wouldn’t accept a pay rise himself, the spokesman replied: “I’m simply saying they haven’t set out any detail yet so I wouldn’t wish to comment while that independent process is taking place. “Beyond that we would expect to see restraint on these issues.”Richard Lloyd, IPSA’s Chair, said: “This is the first increase in pay for MPs in two years and follows the average of increases across the public sector last year. MPs play a vital role in our democracy and this is reflected in their pay. He added: It is right that MPs are paid fairly for the responsibility and the unseen work they do helping their constituents, which dramatically increased last year. For Parliament to reflect society, it is vital that people from all walks of le can be an MP.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON IspaNational Insurance Company Ltd.Richard LloydBoris JohnsonEnergy billsPublic sector workersPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue. War in Europe might save Johnsonnot an invaded country or Putin.

Palomo, who is completely blind, was found curled up under a car trembling with fear but instead of growling at his rescuer, he hugged her. The two-year-old dog is said to wiggle with happiness when in the company of humans but despite this, he has been unable to secure his own home.The crossbreed, who is currently being fostered by a family in Cornwall, is up for adoption with Blind Dog Rescue UK.A spokesperson from Blind Dog Rescue UK said: Palomo was abandoned in a street near the home of one of our shelter volunteers.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  It was neighbours who warned her and she immediately went to look for him. Our volunteer gave him a treat and he was so happy with this gesture that he came out of his hiding place without any problem. At no time did he growl or bite her. On the contrary, he hugged her.Palomo has been described as a happy little dog who has perfectly adapted to his blindness, which vets believe is a genetic trait.He immediately integrated into his foster family and became the darling of the whole neighbourhood, the spokesperson added. He is tender and very cuddly with everyone and begging to be in your arms like a little baby.He never makes any gesture or sign of aggression and only seeks to be able to have fun or get closer to you.

Johan Lequellenec and fiancee Naomi Gilham have been waiting over three years to tie the knot after having their previous bookings cancelled due to Covid. The couple, from St Helens, Merseyside, already had their wedding at Azul Beach Resort Riviera in Cancun, Mexico, cancelled twice due to the pandemic. Now, although they fly to the resort on March , the couple claim they still havenapost been given their actual wedding date by TUI. Former welder Johan, , and health carer Naomi, , have been unable to make basic arrangements for the wedding, such as hiring a photographer. Dad-of-three Johan has now lost faith that the holiday company has even arranged the event after struggling to get anywhere with TUI staff in store and on the phone.Speaking today, he said: We are so stressed right now, itaposs not something we can pay for againit doesnapost go ahead. Weaposve been to the Liverpool store and the woman thataposs been helping us has been great. Sheaposs tried all sorts and is as disgusted as us. The CEOs and directors arenapost bothered and the wedding team just tells us to wait. We canapost afford for it not to go ahead. Weaposve put every penny we own into it.

When told by a TUI rep to contact the store that they booked the TUI holiday through directly, he responded: TUI they have done. The woman that has been dealing with us has done all she can but no one to complain to at weddings.We leave in less than four weeks after being booked three years ago and no wedding date, nothing has been organised for our wedding at all.A TUI spokeswoman told the Mirror: It can take up to eight weeks from us receiving a fully completed and signed wedding contract and customers receiving confirmation of their wedding date. This is clearly communicated and included in the wedding contract.

Following a post-mortem examination, a medical cause of death of caffeine toxicity was given as Mr Mansfield was found to have mg of caffeine per litre of blood, the coroner heard. Caffeine toxicity can be caused by levels at mg per litre of blood or higher. In his conclusion, Mr Gittins recorded Mr Mansfieldaposs death as misadventure due to the unintended result of his own actions in consuming the caffeine powder. Mr Gittins added that he has since been massively reassured that action has been taken to help prevent similar cases from occurring in the future with this brand of caffeine powder due to the provision of a scoop and an A instruction sheet in all new packets. Had these scoops been provided at the time, Mr Mansfield would likely still be alive today, the coroner said in his conclusion.  The instructions and warnings on the caffeine powder packet was not in breach of regulations at the time, the coroner heard. Thomas and Suzannah have two children together, Tommy and Millie, and well-wishers rallied round to fundraise for the family following Tomaposs death. Writing on social media, Suzy said she was absolutely heartbroken by the tragedy. She said: My world has been ripped apart and my kids have lost their daddy. Iaposve lost the love of my le. Tom passed away at the hospital, the family tried so hard but it wasnapost enough. He was my whole le Iaposll never get over this. You were my le Tom.

It comes after clear evidence shows an increased risk to peopleaposs safety when running alongside another participant with a dog, with some becoming tangled in or tripping over the dogaposs lead.A statement reads: We carefully record and review all parkrun-related incidents, and our global incident database allows us to make operational decisions based on the reality of what’s happening in our parks and open spaces.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Over ten percent of incidents at parkrun events involve dogs, and as such we have spent signicant time considering the nature, frequency, and severity of dog-related incidents. Our evidence shows that, when participants use waist harnesses, there is an increased risk of serious incidents, particularly trips and falls, compared to when using handheld leads. These are typically associated with dogs running in front of other participants, and are occurring when people are together in groups, when people with dogs are overtaking others, and when people with dogs are being overtaken. Unfortunately, the nature of parkrunning with a waist harness is such that the lead allows dogs to move from side to side, in front of the participant, which can result in the dog suddenly and unexpectedly crossing in front of other participants on the course.Under the new rules, dogs should be kept on a short, handheld, non-extendable lead by the side of the participant and should remain within reach at all time. As always, only one dog is allowed per participant and care must be taken to avoid tripping other parkrunners. The statement added: Since the earliest days of parkrun, we’ve openly welcomed people participating with their dogs. Paul Sinton-Hewitt, the founder of parkrun, would participate in the Bushy Park Time Trial with his, and we’ve always felt that it was not only something that emphasised the informal nature of our events, but provided an opportunity for dog owners to participate where they otherwise might be excluded. Over the last  years however, we have grown from a single event into a global movement, with hundreds of thousands of weekly participants, across  dferent countries. As such we continually review our processes in order to balance accessibility and inclusivity with the safety of our participants and other park users. Importantly, we remain of the belief that, overall, the benefits of allowing participation with dogs far outweigh the risks of doing so. Our commitment has always been, and always will be, to support participation with dogs wherever it is appropriate to do so. Do you have a dog story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

Anthony Bleakley lives with his family of six in a housing association home in Heywood, Manchester.He told ManchesterEveningNews : We only put this wallpaper up six months ago, it just falls off. But itaposs the hole in the floor below it thataposs the most shocking.We took up the laminate to show more evidence [of the damp]. I was standing on it and it just fell through. Under the floorboards, he says he can see a pool of water.  He added: A lot of the water has gone now but there still is some. When it rains it fills up a lot. Anthony, who has been living in the house for three years, has covered the gaping hole with a playhouse. He said: Iaposm a groundworker by trade so I know whataposs gone on. On their road, the rising damp has affected multiple houses and is a failure of damp proof courses, according to Matthew Condrad, the director of Tenant Claim, who is representing Anthonyaposs family. He says the type of damp proofing the housing association used only has a lespan of around  years - and now it has expired. Two of the four kids in the home have asthma. According to the NHS website,there is mould and damp in the home youaposre more likely to have respiratory problems, respiratory infections, allergies or asthma. Damp and mould can also affect the immune system.Natalie Lake is another resident who lives on the road and fears for her childrenaposs health. Her daughter, Jorja-Maria Lake, has recently been diagnosed with asthma. She said: Sheaposs only three. Her asthma gets so bad she ends up in hospital. Sheaposs very young. Natalieaposs home has many of the same damp problems as Anthonyaposs, she says.  She lted up the laminate in dferent corners of her living room to expose the rotten floorboards. She said: When I walk around the house at night I can feel the floor breaking. Iaposm sure thereaposs water underneath. Itaposs just everywhere. Natalie and Anthony have said that theyaposve both been going to their housing association - Rochdale Boroughwide Housing - for help. But so far, they claim that nothing has been done to properly combat the damp.  Natalie claims that when she had rats, it took them around three years to sort. She added: My mental health went through the roof with the rats. I just feel really upset and angry and frustrated. Anthony said: We keep reporting things but nothing is happening. They keep fobbing us off. They think they can get away with it because we live here and theyaposve got us trapped. The couple had plans to buy their home through Right to Buy in what would be a aposbig savingapos, but are now put off by the aposdisrepairapos of the property. He added: We keep wanting to get the house done up but thereaposs no point.  Lawyer Matthew Condrad told MEN: The properties are affected by rising damp, which is rotting the floorboards, ruining furnishings, and threatening the health of residents. Floorboards are collapsing, and pools of water are visible underneath, from which water is rising into the floorboards, skirting boards and lower walls. This rising damp is due to failure of the damp proof courses. A chemical injection damp proof course has been inserted to alleviate damp, but its approximate -year lespan has expired, meaning that urgent repairs are required in the area. Rat infestations are also a reoccurring problem, causing an additional health risk to residents. A spokesperson from Rochdale Boroughwide Housing said: We received a report of a rat infestation behind one set of homes on Cedar Avenue, Heywood in late . Following a detailed survey, we commissioned extensive drainage work to recty the problem. This was completed in late January . We have not received any further reports of rats in this area. We recently received a report of damp in a home on Cedar Avenue. Our joiner attended on Friday, February , and confirmed that further work is required. We will undertake this work as quickly as possible. RBH tenants who need to report an issue can do so quickly and easily by phone, by e-mail to customerexperience@rbh.org.uk or via the MyRBH online portal.

The police and legal experts have some good advice for people in this situationThere often isnt anything the police or council can do about a car blocking a driveway Image: Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Mar |comments For residents on tightly packed and busy streets, a blocked driveway can be a complete nightmare. Not knowing how long it will be until the car is moved and you can carry on with your day, be it the school run, going to work or any other reason can put plans on hold.A blocked driveway may just be an unfortunate part of where a person lives, but sometimes angry residents are justied in their annoyance. Certain conditions under the Highway Code mean that a car should be movedit is blocking a driveway.Unfortunately there is also a legal loophole that means motorists can park in annoying places. So what are the conditions under the code that mean cars can be moved Where in the Highway Code does it say you canapost park in front of a driveway   Rule  of the Highway Code states that people should not stop aposin front of an entrance to a propertyapos. However, this only relates tothe car is also blocking the road. Charlotte Dixon, a solicitor at DAS Law, told The Mirror in : The Highway Code can only helpthe parked car is causing an obstruction to the road but not in relation to private land.  Also, not all Highway Codes are legally binding and there is a dference between you aposmust notapos and aposdo notapos. Rule  comes under the latter and stipulates people should not stop unless forced to do so by stationary traffic. A legal loophole says that any car can park on your driveway and local authorities cannot do anything about it because it is private property. It can be removedthe police suspect it to have been abandoned, butthe car has a valid MOT, is taxed and insured and is not in a dangerous condition then there is little the police or council can do. Someone is blocking my driveway, what are my rights   There are several steps you can takea person is blocking your driveway. You should first checkthe space outside your house is designated parking. If it is not, then strangers have a right to park there just as much as you. If someone is parked in your designated space, you can contact your local authority, but there is always the chance the driver has not realised and the issue may be solved with a polite note or conversation.  Dixon said: The first step with any anti-social parking problem is to contact your local authority or the police however there is little the law can do to support home owners – evena car blocks your driveway. One option that’s available is to pursue a legal claim for nuisance on the grounds that the driver is interfering with your use and enjoyment of your property – but to do so you’d need to know the identity of the offending vehicle’s driver. The Met Police also advises people to contact their local authority first. They said: If someone has blocked your driveway so you can’t drive in, we appreciate this can be very frustrating. If you can find the owner of the vehicle, we’d first recommend asking them politely to move it. If you can’t find them, try leaving a note on their windscreen. After all, they may not realise they have caused a problem.

One reviewer said: Dreadful hotel. We booked it last minute and wished we had done some research. First impressions weren’t great - there was a slurring, swearing woman falling over a sofa in the bar which adjoins the reception then the rooms are pretty grubby and smell of stale smoke. But the real issue is this hotel isn’t just for travellers: there is a huge poster in the reception advertising cheap wedding packages. Half the rooms are directly above theroom and it appears no effort has been made to stop the noise from these cheap weddings travelling. So it is midnight, we have an early morning flight to catch and have zero chance of sleep as there is music blaring up to our rooms from downstairs. The manager on duty couldn’t care less.While this hotel may advertise itself as an airport hotel,you need somewhere to stay before a flight, avoid this place like the plague- it has no interest in meeting your needs. Another TripAdvisor user titled their review aposThe FILTHIEST hotel I have ever stayed inapos. During February this year, Evie Wilman said: Staff were lovely - no complaints there. The entire hotel reeked, to the point we felt sick. Got to our room, opened the door to something that looks like it hasn’t been decorated in  years.   plug sockets weren’t working so couldn’t charge everything we needed to for the flight, had to do this from my car. This is where it gets bad, we weren’t comfortable here so we started to look around just for cleanliness.  They then continued: Carpet not hoovered, crumbs everywhere. Breadsticks under the bed. Hairs in the bed. Poo-stained towel. Mould in the bathroom. Stained wall with God knows what. Dust everywhere. One guest claimed they endured their aposmost dreadful Christmas everapos at the hotel and was apospleasedapos when they couldhome. The hotel boasts leisure facilities including an indoor pool, gym, sauna and squash courts. But TripAdvisor user Nannapam claimed the facilities were closed during their stay. They said: We were given this hotel as a Christmas four-night stay as a coach holiday with Just Go. Staff were lovely, trying to make up for the awfulness of the hotel but they were disorganised and totally overwhelmed by several coach parties arriving for a Christmas stay. All food was in buffet style, not particularly appetising and certainly not hot. Christmas lunch was served at tables but so over cooked it was inedible. The room we had was not a bad size but the bathroom was just unacceptable, with only a sprinkle shower in the bath and any extras needed having to be asked for, such as toilet rolls. There was a swimming pool, which would have made the stay a little better but was closed on Christmas day and Boxing Day. Nothing  much to do there, can go for a short walk but nothing  in the near proximity of the hotel. Entertainment was there each night of the stay, first night was brilliant but downhill after that. A disco was put on for Christmas night but was so loud, could not stay in the same room. Just pleased when our stay came to an end and we couldhome.  After arriving at the Airport Inn at .am, TripAdvisor user Ian slack said: On arrival we experienced the couple in the next room arguing loudly with themselves, this carried on through the night and at .am I phoned the reception to get the noise stopped. Which didn’t happen. You would expect that a hotel called the Airport Inn would cater for travellers arriving late at night, and have some sort of noise code, similar to the Premier Inn. When I expressed my dissatisfaction on checkout the staff member on duty was . Also the hotel is grubby and tired, the bathroom was stained, as were the carpets. The whole appearance of the hotel was that of a rundown, past it’s best business. I wouldn’t touch this establishment with a barge pole. There is at least one guest who left happy, however. One four-star review - the only four-star rating in the past four months - was left in January by a satisfied customer. They said: Good reception got us checked in efficiently. Now to the rooms, I have no complaints or observations about dark wood headboard or furniture, I do have observations about clean white sheets and clean white towel. Dinner buffet style and for what we paid [on] the night very acceptable in fact I had the very tasty chilli. Good nightaposs sleep followed by a very good breakfast. The toaster did only toast one side though, which I am sure some people could make a huge drama about. Well done to the catering staff who could not have worked any harder or been more helpful… A very good nightaposs stay and would not hesitate to stay again.

Then, after their relationship broke down, she only communicated with her by putting notes under her door and “shouting” at her bedroom window from the garden, the tenant claims.In a video seen by the publication, the landlady’s friend appears to call the -year-old a “delightful c***” and a “peasant” before attempting to snatch the phone from the tenant, prompting the landlady to intervene. Screenshots also allegedly show the landlady attempting to end Mel’s three-month fixed-term contract early. Mel says her landlady, who charged her £ a month to live in the two-storey Victorian house, was fine for the first two days after she moved in last December, but then “restrictions started raining down”.Sheena gave Mel a printed set of rules that restricted her access to the kitchen during the day while she ran PT sessions from home. Mel claims Sheena also restricted her to only coming down the stairs once a day to avoid disturbing her while she worked in the lounge. She also claims she was banned from having deliveries sent to the house as the doorbell was too distracting. She said the wardrobes in the property were also full of her landladyaposs personal stuff, leaving her no choice but to store her own belongings in the loft or the shed. Mel claims that Sheena told her via WhatsApp : “You pay for a ROOM. If you want full access to the half, pay half the bills too. When you can pay £, you can have equal say! Have some respect and not be so bloody entitled.”Responding, Sheena said the printed rules were “part of the lodger licence agreement and that the pair’s personalities “were not a good fit”. She added: “I agreed to move to the living room so she could have access, but she walked up and down the stairs several times and moved her belongings so I realised it wouldn’t work.” On December ,  days after she moved in, Mel said her landlady gave her a one-month notice to leave the property. But on January  Mel claims Sheena asked her tenant to stay and apologised for being “feisty”. Mel said she agreed to stay, on the condition she would have a “trial period” until the end of the month. Sheena claimed the trial period was “conditional on us resolving our dferences which we didn’t. WhatsApp screenshots seen by MyLondon allegedly show Sheena changed her mind, telling Mel on January : “I will give you written notice tomorrow to leave on the st of January. I don’t care [about] the contract, I just want you to leave.” On January , Mel was once again served with a notice to leave - this time by February . By that time, Mel claimed that Sheena had blocked her on WhatsApp and was refusing to speak with her in the house, communicating only through notes passed under her door and letters from her solicitor. Sheena explained: “I used notes to avoid further personal clashes which were very distressing and personal to me during my workday.” On January , Mel received a notice to leave the property at the end of the fixed termfrom Sheena’s solicitor. Four days later, on the night of January , Sheena invited guests to her home. When Mel asked the group to turn down the music they were playing, she claims one of the guests confronted her. Mel filmed the encounter, threatening to call the police. The video, seen by MyLondon, allegedly shows the friend responding: “For what  You f***ing peasant. What a delightful c*** you are,” before attempting to snatch the camera. Sheena can allegedly be seen intervening to calm the situation and telling Mel: “Call the police. It’s fine.” A Met spokesperson said: “Police were called at .pm on Friday, January  to reports of a civil dispute at a residential property in Longfellow Road, Worcester Park. Officers attended and gave words of advice. No arrests were made.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON WhatsAppproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kate Green complained of feeling funny and within just  minutes the -year-old went from walking and talking, to mumbling and frothing at the mouth.Kateaposs husband Adam told Yorkshire Live : Sheaposd taken my son swimming and had just got back and walked in the house.She had just gotten into the hallway and said aposI feel really funnyapos and I asked when it had started and she had told me aposwell just, Iaposve got a headache in the back of my headapos and I thought that was strange because you donapost usually get a headache in the back, itaposs usually the front or the side. Adam said that, within minutes, his we was laid on the bed upstairs in the fetal position and had started to have trouble speaking and breathing properly. She said aposI donapost feel right, I canapost moveapos, so I told her that I was calling the doctor and I knew it was serious because she didnapost say aposdonapostapos, Adam, , said. The GP surgery told Adam to immediately ring for an ambulance.  Adam said: Kate was murmuring and frothing at the mouth, thataposs when Stanley got on the bed and said aposmummy, mummy I love you mummyapos and then Vicky thankfully arrived and took him downstairs. But Kate started breathing really weirdly, it was a growling sound - like a death rattle - she was really struggling to take a breath and she looked like she was locked in. A paramedic told Adam that her symptoms were indicative of a severe bleed on the brain and when she was taken to Rotherham Hospital, staff told Adam that Kate had suffered an acute pontine stroke. This type of stroke can lead to what is known as Locked-in Syndrome - where a patient is conscious and aware, but completely unable to move. He said: They effectively told me that I needed to call her family and I had to call them to say aposyou need to come to say goodbyeapos, as we thought the worst was going to happen. Kate had been put into an induced coma when she arrived at the hospital so that doctors could assess what damage had been done to her brain. Adam said that it did not take long for small miracles to begin happening as, a few days later, staff had turned off her ventilator to see how she would respond. When Kateaposs ventilator was turned off, she opened her eyes and took a large breath.  Adam said: But even at that point, there was no indication as to what quality of le she might have. The worst case scenario when she was admitted was that she would die, but then it kind of shted slightly to she might be in a vegetative state and be in a nursing home all her le. But then, after  days, she opened her eyes and her occupational and speech therapists were asking her questions, so she was looking up for yes and down for no, so theyaposd ask her questions about her le and were trying to catch her out with some questions to see what her mental capacity was like. Theyaposd ask her things like aposyour husband is called John apos and sheaposd look down and they would say aposoh itaposs Adam, is it apos and sheaposd look up. Then, they used an alphabet board so they could communicate and sheaposd spell words out. Adam added: One of the first things I remember is coming onto the ward one morning, the speech therapist told me that sheaposd managed to spell my name, Stanleyaposs name and the word aposloveapos - it completely did me. That was my almost epiphany that she was going to be alright because her brain is there and sheaposs got a bloody big brain - sheaposs very tenacious. She doesnapost ever back out of anything that she says sheaposs going to do. Sheaposs got so much to live for and there was no way she was going to lay back over this, she was going to fight it. Though there have been some horric lows over the last three months - such as coming to terms with the idea that Kate may have Locked-in Syndrome for the rest of her le - Adam said that there have also been moments of tremendous hope and joy. And one of the biggest moments of joy was when Kate began to move the left side of her body, proving to Adam that she was determined to overcome her paralysis and begin recovering. Adam said: I think it was her left thumb that she moved first and things started coming back quite quickly on the left side. And then her toes started moving, against all the odds, it was absolutely remarkable. Sheaposs got pretty much full mobility in her left side now, but she has no strength and thataposll come with physiotherapy. Though she is still bedbound and living on the stroke ward of the hospital, she is speaking again and able to spend time with Adam and Stanley - who desperately misses his mum. Adam said: He misses his mum and is worried heaposs never going to hear her voice again - the voice it was before, because she sounds dferent now. But he comes to the hospital and tells her what heaposs been up to in the day. Heaposs seven and he just misses his mum, thataposs probably whataposs driven Kate so much, is him. Adam has launched a fundraiser so that Kate can get the care she desperately needs, and he has been blown away at the response - with over £, worth of donations in less than  hours. Adam said: Sheaposs very, very well respected. I went in today and told her that weaposd launched a GoFundMe page and she asked how it was going, I told her that it had gone over £, and she just lost it, she burst into tears. We know itaposs a very, very long process, but sheaposs doing all this against the odds. It was a very, very bleak picture and the consultant on the ward that sheaposs on now said that, in his whole career, sheaposs the only one who has ever survived this stroke.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly.

On one occasion, when she discovered a dead slug on her dinner plate, she responded in the best way.The Queenaposs former servant, Charles Oliver, recalled the incident and how she reacted in his book aposDinner at Buckingham Palaceapos, reports MyLondon. Oliver revealed that when the Queen and her late husband Prince Philip would eat together, they would keep a notepad next to their plates so they could make notes about the meal and give their feedback to the chef.Once, on a torn-off top sheet the footmen found the dead body of a slug, Oliver said.

On the note, the Queen had written: I found this in the salad—could you eat it  She then sent the plate of food and the note back to the kitchen, the Daily Mailaposs Weekend magazine reports. One of the chefs, Darren McGrady, says the Queen chooses all of the food that she eats off of specic menus from the kitchen. Darren explained: The chef does three days’ menus and that gives us enough time to get all the produce in and prepare it. When the menu book goes up to the Queen she puts a line through all the dishes she doesn’t want.If she’s out for dinner she’ll put a line through the page. Andshe has a guest coming she’ll put two or three, so we know she is entertaining,” Darren said. He also revealed that she hates pasta, garlic and onion, but she loves to eat chicken or fish with vegetables or salad. The food she does like, on the other hand, is kept under lock and key as she has never revealed them, not even to the staff in the kitchen. Former royal correspondent Gordon Rayner, who has covered more than  royal tours, discovered this fact from someone who worked with the royal family.  He explained to The Express : As one of her staff told me, aposIf she said she had a favourite meal she would never get served anything .aposBefore sheaposs due to travel for royal duties, someone from the team will also go on a ‘reconnaissance’ mission to make sure itaposs up to standard, andnot, to make any necessary tweaks. The Master of the Household department will be in the reconnaissance party to tell foreign chefs not to cook anything with garlic or too much spice for fear of giving the Queen bad breath, and not to cook shellfish or anything that could cause food poisoning, he added.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Researchers have shown how it helped ancient Britons keep track of the days, weeks and months in a solar year of . days. The tropical solar calendar, with  day weeks and extra months, is similar to those used at the time in ancient Egypt and researchers say could be evidence of links between Britain and other civilisations. Professor Timothy Darvill, of Bournemouth University, said: “Such a solar calendar was developed in the eastern Mediterranean in the centuries after , BC, was adopted in Egypt as the Civil Calendar around , and was widely used at the start of the Old Kingdom about , BC.”  Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England. It has long been thought the formation of the huge -tonne sarsen stones could be a form of calendar but how it worked was not understood. The discovery based on analysis of other ancient calendar systems may have solved a puzzle that has been speculated on for centuries. Mystery still shrouds how such a huge structure could have been erected by our ancestors. The findings, published in the journal Antiquity, conclude winter and summer solstices would be framed by the same pairs of stones every year. Errors in counting the days would be easily detectable as the sun would be in the wrong place on the solstices. Prof Darvill added: “The proposed calendar works in a very straightforward way.  “Each of the  stones in the sarsen circle represents a day within a month, itself ided into three weeks each of  days. “The four Station Stones outside the Sarsen Circle provide markers to notch up until a leap day. “Finding a solar calendar represented in the architecture of Stonehenge opens up a whole new way of seeing the monument as a place for the living. “A place where the timing of ceremonies and festivals was connected to the very fabric of the universe and celestial movements in the heavens.” Archaeologists believe that Stonehenge was constructed from , BC to , BC. The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch, which constitute the earliest phase of the monument, have been dated to about , BC.

He masterminded the theft of Goya’s portrait of the Duke of Wellington from the National Gallery as part of his campaign. But unlike the Duke in his defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, Kempton won his moral victory without an army to back him. Kempton evaded detection for four years, before handing the painting back through the good offices of this newspaper. It was The Daily Mirror wot solved it. He had made his point, and gave himself up to the police – who had suspected him but could not believe that a -stone -year-old could outwit the gallery’s state-of-the-art security. It was like something out of Hollywood’s The Thomas Crown Affair, except for the fact that Kempton was no Pierce Brosnan.That is why he is played by Jim Broadbent in The Duke, the new comedy drama co-starring Dame Helen Mirren which has been been delighting cinema viewers since its long-awaited release last weekend. But the real story is more remarkable than anything Hollywood types could imagine. The story begins in , when the Government intervened to keep the famous portrait of the Duke from being sold to a wealthy American collector. The artwork is quite small, at in by in. Legend has it that Spanish artist Francisco Goya only persuaded Wellington to pose by threatening him with a pistol. The painting was bought for the nation and put on display in the Gallery’s main entrance lobby on August . Less than three weeks later, on  August, it was stolen in a heist that baffled police. It was the first theft from the National in  years, and gallery boss Sir Philip Hendy was informed about it in his bath. He later said: “You feel a bloody fool, that’s the truth.” The trail went cold for four years, before a mystery reader wrote to the Daily Mirror in March , from a post office in Darlington, Co Durham claiming to be The Man with the Goya.  Anxious for the portrait to be restored to its rightful owners – “the people, all of us” – the Mirror’s then editor, Cecil King, appealed to him to do the right thing. In a confused reply, the man demanded £, for theof the painting, to be raised by public exhibition. He further demanded a confirmatory message in the newspaper’s personal column signed “Whitfield”. If those conditions were met, he told the paper, “you will receive a letter informing you to pick up the Goya”. On page three of the next day’s paper, the following appeared: T.Y.AYour letter received and understood. Mr Mystery wrote again, enclosing a receipt for the left-luggage office at Birmingham New Street station. Caramba! Detectives retrieved the stolen masterpiece, but still had no suspect – until Bunton surrendered himself six weeks later at London’s West End police station. Initially detectives doubted his story, questioning whether a -year-old disabled man weighing  stone could have done the job. But he was charged with the theft of the £, masterpiece, and its £ frame, plus other offences. Before Bow Street magistrates, Kempton said: “I had no intention of keeping the painting, or of depriving the nation permanently of it. I never wished to obtain anything for myself. My sole object in all this was to set up a charity to pay for TV licences for old and poor people who seem to be neglected in our affluent society.”  He had served three short prison sentences for refusing to buy a license in protest at the government spending so much money on a painting while pensioners couldn’t afford to watch TV. At his Old Bailey trial, Jeremy Hutchinson QC successfully argued that since Bunton never intended to keep the painting, he couldn’t be convicted of stealing it. The jury agreed, and acquitted him on that charge, and of charges of demanding money with menaces and of causing a public nuisance, but found him guilty of stealing the frame, for which he got three months. The frame was never found, and legend says it was thrown into the Thames. The painting went back on display, and that was the end of the Thomas Crown tribute. Except it wasn’t. In , National Gallery documents suggested that someone  could have carried out the actual theft, and suspicion fell on Bunton’s son, John. But it was not until  that he was finally identied as the culprit, in a confidential file from the Director of Public Prosecutions in the National Archives. John “Jackie” Bunton, then a -year-old van driver and former petty criminal, living in nearby Tottenham Court Road, had climbed over the gallery’s back wall in the early hours of August , , and used a builder’s ladder to gain entry through an unlocked gents’ toilet window. He found the Goya standing on an easel in a roped-off enclosure at the top of the main stairs. “I went up to it, took hold of it, and carried it back to the gents’ toilet,” he said in a statement. He got out the way he came in, put the painting on the back seat of his getaway car , took it back to his lodgings and put it under his bed. Nothing could ever have been proved against Bunton Jr, but he panicked after being arrested and fingerprinted in Leeds in  for a minor offence. Anxious that he might have left his prints in the Gallery, he told officers he wanted to tell them about something that had been bothering him for some time, and confessed to the Goya job. Asked why he didn’t try to sell his valuable haul, instead of giving it to his father, Bunton Jr said: “He intended to use it as a tool in his campaign, and that it should ultimately be ed to the National Gallery.” But why did he, nor his brother Ken who was in on the knowledge, not come clean at the time and save their father an Old Bailey trial  “He told us not to. Ordered us. It was his wish,” he said. Sir Norman Skelhorn, who was Director of Public Prosecutions at the time of Bunton’s confession, ruled that it alone was not enough to prosecute him. Nor could his father be successfully prosecuted for perjury without relying on the evidence of his son, an unreliable witness. So the case was quietly dropped. Apart from legal niceties, a view may have been taken that another very public airing of the art sting of the century might not be in the public – that is, the authorities’ – interest. Evidently still embarrassed by the Goya saga  years after the event, the Gallery yesterday refused to answer any questions from the Mirror, despite being the beneficiary of our efforts to reunite the painting with its rightful owners. Kempton Bunton, so named after his father had a win at the races, died in obscurity in Newcastle in , aged , but his name lives on in popular culture as the Geordie Robin Hood for pensioners. Jackie, now  and living in North Tyneside, does not wish to talk about the episode.  But speaking from New York, Jackie’s son Chris, , an entrepreneur, acknowledges the key role of this newspaper in solving the great Goya heist mystery. He says: “It’s why they ed the painting – because, after four and a half years, the Daily Mirror were acting as middle-man to get the picture back. They played a prominent role.” In the film, Kempton Buntonis shown walking with son Jackie, holding a copy of the Mirror and talking about the paper’s role in the Goya saga. Chris says the producers have made the movie as authentically as possible. “We have given the full picture,” he says. “The film says it all. “I hope it becomes one of the great classic films that is played every Christmas.” He never knew his grandfather, the original plotter, but stoutly defends his dad Jackie, the man on a ladder with a mission. “He was a flawed character, but ultimately a good person and I’m proud of him,” he says. “To me, he was a hero, and this film brings closure to the whole -year episode.” The pair regularly talk on the phone and while Jackie declined to talk to The Mirror, Chris met up with him when he ed to the UK last week. “It was really good to see him,” he says. “I took him to where he used to live. He’s  years old now, and not in the best of health. Does he make me proud  Yes.”  The film, The Duke, is billed as the story of how one man stole a national treasure and then stole the nation’s hearts. It has been awaiting release since the early days of the pandemic. The story has, however, appeared on film before. The most amusing spoof of the saga appeared in the  Bond film, Dr No, when Sean Connery’s James Bond spots the portrait in the villain’s lair, saying: “So that’s where it is!” As he was driven away to serve his term at HMP Wandsworth, Kempton Bunton remarked: “I am intrigued by the verdict.” Not half as intriguing, however, as the crime-that-never-was saga that humiliated the establishment. Kempton sadly never lived to see his ambition of free old folks’ free TV licences enacted by Labour. But he might have gone back on the warpath when they were recently abolished by the Tories. What a film that would be.

After seeing her GP, Tess was referred to AE and in January , she was diagnosed with stage  low-grade serous carcinoma .  Tess saidit wasnapost for Lola jumping on her stomach and smelling her breath, her rare form of oian cancer may have gone undetected for longer. For about ten days in the run-up to Christmas in , Lola just wouldn’t leave me alone and kept smelling my breath at every opportunity,” she said. She was just staring at me which was not normal. Someone even asked: aposWhataposs wrong with your dog, why is she just staring at you apos I’m convinced she was trying to tell me something, but it was only when she jumped on my tummy that I realised something was wrong. Literally two days after she jumped on my stomach, a lump appeared. I thought thataposs not good, that shouldnapost be there so I made an appointment with my doctor.  I didnapost feel unwell I was just bloated and had a bad back. I looked four months pregnant! Tess was told there was a mass in her stomach, but as doctors werenapost entirely sure what it was, she was sent to Sunderland Royal Hospital - and later the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Tess was shocked to discover her lump was actually stage  cancer. I spoke to my husband and said theyaposve done tests and unfortunately itaposs oian cancer but I will get through it, I will be absolutely fine,” she said. My whole mindset from when I first got my diagnosis was Iaposm going to beat this. In March last year, Tess underwent a -hour operation to have a full hysterectomy. During the surgery, it became evident that the cancer had spread to Tessapos bowel.  Thankfully, recent tests have confirmed that the surgery and subsequent chemotherapy have been successful – but it was still a long road back to health for Tess. As well as her dog, she extended her thanks to the hospital staff, who she said had been “amazing”. Now, Tess is living le to the fullest, saying she feels reborn. The only way I can describe it is I feel reborn,” she said. “I never used to go out but now Iaposm doing everything I ever wanted to do. Le is for living and thataposs what Iaposm going to do. But she said this may not have been possibleit wasnapost for Lola who told her, in her own way, that something was wrong. Tess said: I owe my le to Lola because she clearly knew something was wrong, and because of her I was able to seek medical help sooner. Lola literally saved my le, Iaposm so grateful for her. If I had left it any longer I may not be here today. To help her recuperate from her chemotherapy, Tess is having a relaxing and peaceful outside space built at her home, by volunteer landscapers from the charity Band of Builders. Band of Builders , is a registered charity that completes practical projects to help members of the UK construction industry who are battling illness or injury. Friends of Tess told her and her husband Paul, who is a plasterer, about the support offered by BoB and now half a dozen tradespeople are offering their time for free to complete the project. It will take place on the weekend of March  and  with the main element of the project a new decked area in the garden so that Tess can sit outside and enjoy the sunshine. BoB has more than , supporters from across the construction industry and is backed by major names within the industry who along with local suppliers will donate materials for the project. This will be the rd project to date by the charity. Project lead Kent Taylor said that is another great example of how the construction industry looks after its own. The Band of Builders community never ceases to amaze with its ability to rally round and volunteer on projects for fellow tradespeople and their families, working on renovation or repair projects that make a real dference to their lives,” Kent said. During chemotherapy, Tess lost all her hair and all her confidence drained away, so family friends Chris and Meg Bennett started crowdfunding to buy her a wig made from real hair. The Bennetts also told the Robisons about the support provided by BoB and after contacting the charity, plans were put in place to help Tess, Paul, and Lola.

Dr. Anthony regularly shares nuggets of medical wisdom with his . million TikTok followers, educating them on fascinating health and human biology-related topics such as how to live  years longer and where does hair come from A recent video, which has been viewed more than . million times, has left followers particularly engrossed, revealing that there is in fact a notable correlation between fingerand penis size.The doctor went on to detail a study, published in the Asian Journal of Andrology back in , which was carried out on  Korean men over the age of twenty.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The men, whoaposd all been hospitalized for urological surgery, were anaesthetised before their respective operations, having given their informed consent beforehand. Whilst they were still under anaesthetic, the surgeons measured theof the menaposs index and ring fingers, before going on to measure the size of their penis whilst it was flaccid and stretched out. It was determined that the men with smaller index fingers were more likely to be on the bigger side, while those with ier index fingers had smaller members. As per this study: Based on this evidence, we suggest that the digit ratio can predict adult penile size and that the effects of prenatal testosterone may in part explain the dferences in adult penile .  After running through the study findings, Dr. Anthony - who goes by the username tonyyounmd proceeded to display his own hand, which he compared with the digits of another TikTok doctor, Dr. Ricky Brown, smirking as he asked fans to look at that long index finger!The clip has made quite the impression on Dr. Anthonyaposs followers, who of course couldnapost help but take a quick glimpse at their own fingers. One person wrote, “I have small fingers... this can’t be right.

She snapped back: I don’t sleep with drunks and I have a man … but thanks for highlighting your ignorance and bullying tendencies publicly.And replying to another comment which also slammed those who keep saying this junk on make-up videos, she said: Theyaposre always putting their two cents in when it isnapost their business and definitely not needed wanted. Sarah then revealed she is planning on sharing her make-up tips with those who want them in the near future, and also explained why she enjoys sharing her looks online. She said: For me, it’s not about the finished product … it’s about spending time on myself, being creative and having fun. I’m working on tutorials now … they’ll be out by next week.

However, itaposs important that boundaries are respected. One woman has been left feeling uncomfortable after her sister overstepped the mark a bit with her fiancé, Gabriel, treating him as though he was the father of her young son and inviting him to attend his activities as her plus one.According to this baffled bride-to-be, the sister has previously made jokes about how much of a dad -year-old Gabriel is to her son, Joe, always asking him to drive them to places. She once even drunkenly asked whether Gabriel would be comfortable with adopting Joe, despite the soon-to-be-wed couple having already made the decision to remain child-free.The perturbed woman says neither she nor Gabriel feels comfortable with this arrangement at all, but they were unsure of how to push it aside without hurting their feelings. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Taking to Reddit, the worried woman explained that their mother has warned her sister that her behaviour is inappropriate on countless occasions. However, sheaposs always responded in a defensive manner, claiming that Joe chose him and that it is not her faultapos.Things recently came to a head last weekend after little Joe asked Gabrielhe could call him dad, telling him that his mother had said it was fine. All the while, the sister looked at the pair with the biggest smile on her face, while their mother and brother - who donapost agree with the situation either - watched the scene unfold as though they were expecting his answer.The concerned aunt - who goes by the username u EntireAd - wrote: [Gabriel] sat Joe in his knee and kindly explained to him how he wasnapost his dad or even a dad figure, that he was auntaposs partner soon to be husband and that made him his aposfavoriteapos uncle, but evenhe wasnapost his dad, he would never leave him and theyaposll always be best friends. Joe, being the sweet kid he is, laughed and smiled and said that it was okay, then he ran to the living room to play with something. The poster believed the situation has been resolved quite well, with Gabriel having explained things to Joe in a kind and caring manner. However, her sister wasnapost happy at all with his response and began getting into an altercation with them both. She continued: My mom kept telling her to shut up but she was saying things like aposwhataposs wrong with you two apos, aposhow can you say no to a little kid apos, aposhe sees you as a father, so you should be proud of thatapos, I had enough and I told her that Gabriel wasnapost Joeaposs dad and that she needed to stop acting ashe was because it was honestly embarrassing. At this point, her sister began using foul language to insult her and even accused her of being jealous of her son. They decided it was time to leave, but her sister still wasnapost done with them. The poster wrote: She later sent me a text saying that it was bestwe step out of Joeaposs le for a while or we will end up aposconfusingapos him because he doesnapost understand that Gabriel is not daddy. But, as far as I could see, he got it pretty well. Many of those commenting were disturbed by the sisteraposs behaviour, with some even wondering whether or not she might harbour romantic feelings towards Gabriel. One person wrote: I dated someone who had a aposfriendapos who’d lost her husband recently and continually tried to make my boyfriend the new daddy to her kids - always asking him to come to their sporting events, having them draw him pictures, asking him to babysit, etc. It culminated in her making a move on him and proclaiming that her kids saw him as a dad and they aposneeded himapos. Just keep an eye out. Another commented: I am also wonderingthere isnapost a jealousy element. Not that sis wants Gabe for herself, but she is jealous that while she struck out on the partner lottery, her sister hit the aposjackpotapos, ie., she apparently has someone who loves her, and agrees with her, and isnapost going to go absentee on her.Do you have a nightmare family situation to contend with  We pay for stories.

The President, an avid supporter of Vladamir Putin, addressed security officials today while standing in front of a battle map that seems to show a planned operation from southern Ukraine into neighbouring Moldova. The map pointed to the port city of Odessa into Moldova, suggesting Russia plans to march troops into Ukraineaposs neighbour. Nicu Popescu, Moldovaaposs Deputy Prime Minister, admitted today that his country is in a very risky zone with the population feeling anxiety and fear. But Mr Popescu added he does not expect to be invaded and instead sees the biggest challenge as handling an influx of refugees.Follow our Russia-Ukraine Live blog here. An estimated , refugees have fled to Moldova already and more are expected as the conflict rages on.British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said last week: If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine we are going to see others under threat – the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato.”The map featured behind Mr Lukashenko appeared to detail planned Russian lines of attack which have already materialised. It included forces storming towards Kyiv from the north and towards Kherson from Crimea. The map was split into four sections which align with the command districts of Ukraineaposs military, showing Russian attacks from Belarus, along Ukraineaposs eastern border and from occupied Crimea. There are increasing fears that as Russia becomes more isolated under an avalanche of Western sanctions, Vladimir Putin could become even more reckless and set off a world-altering war.Russia on Tuesday stepped up shelling of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, pounding civilian targets there. Casualties mounted and reports emerged that more than  Ukrainian soldiers were killed after Russian artillery recently hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, the capital. But Ukrainian fighters are putting up fierce resistance and Russia has not been able to dominate the skies.  Another attack target highlighted on the map appears to be the city of Cherkasy via the city of Sumy. This area is where Russian forces have been held up and a third target appears to show troops breaking off from the Kyiv assault heading towards Zhytomyr. A Ukrainian military official said Belarusian troops joined the war Tuesday in the Chernihiv region in the north, without providing details. But just before that, Lukashenko said his country had no plans to join the fight. In a clip of the meeting posted online, Lukashenko can also be heard talking about missile strikes launched from Belarusian territory at Ukraine in advance of the main Russian assault. Missiles in the Mazyr region hit those [Ukrainian] positions, after which we didnapost see them again,apos Lukashenko tells his top cabinet. Once the Russians began their advance, we no longer saw those positions. Thataposs why I say that, yes, there were indeed missile launches from Belarusian territory and have shared honestly which targets we attacked. Worryingly in terms of the potential outcome of the war, the chart also features a map of the US mainland and Canada.  A box on the right-hand side seemingly details what appear to be military units also features the badge of the US Army Air Cavalry, while below it there is a map of the whole of Europe - perhaps detailing NATO troop positions. Across Ukraine, civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict with families and children huddled in underground subway stations, basements and other shelters. On Monday, a Ukrainian delegation held talks with Russian officials at the border with Belarus, though they ended with no agreements except to keep talking. Meanwhile, Western sanctions triggered by the invasion sent the Russian rouble plummeting, leading ordinary Russians to line up at banks and ATMs. Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NatoVladimir PutinSoldiersRussia Ukraine warUkraine crisis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But she absconded during her trial at Kingston Crown Court, London, and has been in hiding ever since. The -year-old was part of a £billion VAT fraud gang has now been caught by cops in Spain.The video captures the moment she knew the game was upas the woman from Fulford, near York, faces up to her crimes. She was held by officers after being seen walking her dogs near her home in Santa Barbara village, between Barcelona and Valencia.  The privately-educated scam artist has appeared in court and held in a Spanish jail as extradition proceedings begin. Panitzke was said to have disappeared into thin air after becoming the only woman on the National Crime Agencyaposs Most Wanted List in May  when she stood trial for money laundering offences. She was convicted and sentenced in her absence to eight years following an investigation by HMRC. She was identied as part of an organised crime group responsible for laundering approximately £billion from a mobile phone VAT fraud.  Panitzke and her  co-conspirators were given jail terms totalling  years. They had all been caught, convicted and sentenced, but she remained at large for almost a decade having absconded before the trial had concluded. The NCAaposs International Deputy DirectoTom Dowdall said: Sarah Panitzke has been on the run for almost nine years. Given theof time she might have thought we had stopped searching, but she remained on our radar.  Joint working between UK law enforcement and our partners in Spain led to her being apprehended, and we will now seek her extradition back to the UK to serve her prison sentence. This should serve as a warning to others on our most wanted list - we will not rest until you are captured, no matter how long it takes. Panitzke is said to have grown up in a wealthy family in the village of Escrick, near Selby, North Yorks. She went to York College for Girls before moving on to fee-paying St Peteraposs School which is the third oldest in the world.  Her father Leo, a residential property developer and insurance broker, was jailed for four years for buying council houses and selling them on early for a large profit. She is believed to have lived a le of luxury in a gated community in the hills of Vilanova i la Geltr , an hour from the centre of Barcelona before she vanished.Simon York, director of HMRCaposs fraud investigation service, said: Sarah Panitzke was one of Britainaposs most wanted tax fugitives.She played a pivotal role in a multi-million pound VAT fraud and moved millions through offshore bank accounts.Panitzke thought she had put herself outside of the reach of HMRC, but through our work with UK law enforcement and international partners we have tracked down another tax fugitive. No tax criminal is beyond our reach. We have helped secure themore than  fugitives since , including some of the UKaposs most harmful tax cheats. Lord Ashcroft, founder and chairmain of the independent charity Crimestoppers, said: Itaposs hugely encouraging news to hear of Sarah Panitskeaposs arrest in Spain after being on our Most Wanted list for some years.It shows how our charity, working with the NCA to find the most wanted fugitives, benefits us all. Our communities, here in the UK and abroad, are safer as a result.

Russian troops have been bombarding ill-equipped Ukrainians, some of whom are making home-made weapons, and civilian areas have been hit by bombs. Looking at the Russian operation so far, theyaposre having tremendous problems with logistics and communications. The whole effort seems shambolic, Michael Kofman, an expert on the Russian military at Washingtonaposs Wilson Center, wrote in a tweet.  Morale appears to be low with Ukraine media reporting there was a mutiny on a Russian ship that refused to attack the Ukrainian port of Odessa. Before an all-out assault was to start, the Russians radioed Ukrainian defenders to say they would not attack and asked to be allowed to leave the bay unharmed.Former-Ukrainian diplomat Olexander Scherba, wrote on Twitter : Last night a large group of Russian warships was about to launch landing on Odesa beaches.They approached the coast. Russia was about to shell the beach. Ukraine was about to shoot back when they suddenly withdrew. Reports that marines from Crimea refused to attack Odessa. At the same time Russian troops have been hit harder than expected with images of military vehicles blown up and the bodies of soldiers killed - many of whom have been left where they died.  And voice recordings appear to show desperate frontline soldiers complaining about the state of the army and in tears about what they are being made to do.British intelligence company ShadowBreak Intl has been listening to mobile and radio messages sent by Russian soldiers and recorded the low morale, reported the Daily . In one exchange a senior commander makes an order to hit a town with artillery fire but his subordinate questions it saying that civilians need to be removed first and that was later accepted grudgingly. The senior commander later is heard to say: “We’ve been here for three days! When the hell is it going to be ready ”  Another conversation involves a soldier who appears to be in tears and saying “it’s slow, it’s slow”. ShadowBreak founder Samuel Cardillo said that he had received recordings from amateurs listening into the conversations. Itaposs basically like tapping into a police frequency in the US, said Mr Cardillo. Itaposs basically the Russians transmitting on analogue. So when they request air support, or any kind of support, you will hear the helicopter or the fighter planes. We were told we would be greeted with open arms, but they call us fascists, a Russian soldier reportedly texted his mum in a message that Serhiy Kyslytsia, Ukraineaposs envoy, read out loud at the UN. He also read out that the soldier said: The only thing I want right now is to kill myself.  Mum, Iaposm in Ukraine. This is a real war. Iaposm scared, weaposre firing at everyone, even civilians. Valentina Melnikova, a veteran Russian human rights activist, also said soldiersapos mothers groups were receiving calls from young men in fear of being called up for the invasion. Mr Cardillo continued: There were periods where we heard them [Russian soldiers] crying in combat, a period where they were insulting each other – obviously not a sign of great morale. There was an instance where they shot at each other, there was an instance where they had to transport dead bodies back to their forward operating bases. Many times you can hear them not at their highest level of happiness.

One message read: “Are U sitting in the bunker   Like a rat ” Others slammed her for enjoying an expensive lestyle while Putinaposs actions cause thousands of deaths and untold suffering for millions of people. Luzia is the daughter of cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, , who is now part-owner of a major Russian bank. Svetlana owns a plush £.million Monaco mansion and has not commented on claims that her daughter was fathered by Putin. Follow the latest updates from Ukraine in our live blogHowever, she did tell Russian GQ that she probably looks similar to a young Vlad. Putin has never publicly acknowledged Luzia as his daughter. Luiza - who has , subscribers - stopped publicly posting five months ago, triggering the suspicion that Putin had gagged her.However, her account remains visible and one post on the -year-old’s Instagram says she is the “daughter of a murderer, war criminal, psychopath and drug addict”. Many posts include the Ukrainian blue-and-yellow flag and one carried the message: “The Russian nation must rise against this dictator. You donapost want to have anything to do with him.” But, whilst many railed against her, some commenters also defended her, with one saying: “Donapost judge her...is not her fault.” Another wrote: “She cannot do anything for having a crazy father”. The unprovoked invasion of neighbouring Ukraine by Russian forces on the command of President Vladimir Putin has sparked bloodshed and chaos. With Putinaposs troops shelling cities across Ukraine and the nationaposs army vowing to fight to the death to defend their land, observers fear the death toll will be enormous.On Sunday, February , Ukraineaposs health minister reported that at least  Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the Russian invasion began, and more than , wounded. On March , Ukraine claimed to have killed , Russian soldiers since the start of the invasion. These claims have not yet been independently veried but a human rights monitoring team from the United Nations has confirmed more than  civilian casualties in Ukraine. At least  people have been killed, including  children, a UN report showed on Tuesday. Bachelet, addressing the opening session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, previously said: Most of these civilians were killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and air strikes. The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher. It comes as Ukraineaposs President accused Russia of aposstate terrorismapos on Tuesday after the indiscriminate bombing of Kharkiv.  One more said: “Come on guys, she is just a person. She is not guilty.” But a commenter called Martina hit back: “Yes, she is guilty of passive complicity. It is the same as most of the Germans in the Nazi period.” Another penned: “Call him -he loves you ... maybe you can convince him not to kill.”  One posted: Stop writing sheaposs an innocent. She is the daughter of that devil! She could at least show that she does not agree with what her father is doing, somehow influence him. “Putin doesnapost give a s*** for ordinary people, but maybe his daughters still mean something to him. “She stays quiet because she knowsshe says one bad word to Daddy, she will be cut off from big money, apartments and expensive things. “Unfortunately, there are important things - and more important things. Apparently, purses and villas are more important to her than human le.”Putin has two daughters by his ex-we Lyudmila, the former Kremlin first lady. Likewise, neither of them - Dr Maria Vorontsova, , a geneticist, and Katerina Tikhonova, , a dancer-turned-mathematician, has commented on the war. Reports today suggested Putin had ordered his family to hide in a luxury hi-tech bunker in Siberia. A troll suspecting she may be in her mother’s Mediterranean bolthole said: “While you’re fluffing around in Monaco, people of your generation are dying in Ukraine because of your father.  Further messages highlighted the actions her supposed father is taking and how Russian troops in Ukraine were rumoured to not know where they were or what they were doing. Others pointed to the collapse of the Russian economy under her reported father and slammed her for her expensive branded lestyle. Luzia faced criticism as Ukraine continues to suffer under siege from her fatheraposs forces whilst she previously posted pictures of her le at cafes, on trips to Paris, running her own fashion label or working as a DJ.

That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugeesVladimir Putin has chosen the path of war Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Today we salute the bravery of the Ukrainian people as they struggle to repel the biggest invasion of their country since .Their sacrices in the name of freedom are heartbreaking, humbling, but inspiring. And it is the duty of every civilised nation to do all we can to help them.The air raid sirens wailing over Kyiv  years ago warned against Nazi attacks, not Russian ones. ButVladimir Putin objects to being compared with brutal dictator Adolf Hitler, he has only himself to blame. Like Hitler, Putin’s word cannot be trusted. Like Hitler, he promised peace while all the while being intent on war.Like Hitler, Putin cares nothing forindependence and liberty as he attempts to recreate an empire.And like Hitler, he plans to subjugate a sovereign nation with all the force and brutality at his disposal. Just as we faced down Hitler, we must face up to another dictator determined to destroy the freedoms we hold so dear. And we must do it without sleepwalking into a Third World War.  Boris Johnson compared this invasion with that of Czechoslovakia in . This time there must be no appeasement. That occupation set off a chain of events that took six years of horrying war and  million deaths to resolve. Ukraine must regain its rightful independence sooner than that but, nevertheless, we must be prepared to be in this for the long haul. Now that Putin has chosen the path of war, he has to win it, and we dread to imagine the horrors that might unleash.  That means we must throw open our doors to Ukrainian refugees who appeal to us for a safe haven and might even want to stay here. We are told such a resettlement programme is being prepared. But, as always in Whitehall, the wheels are moving despairingly slowly. Ireland has waived the need for visas for Ukrainians. The Irish will get them to safety first and worry about the paperwork later. We should follow that example. Now it is incumbent on the rest of the world to isolate Russia as the pariah state it is. Even Putin’s traditional ally, China, has shown a certain ambivalence to the tyrant’s actions.  It abstained on the UN resolution to condemn Putin for the invasion – a promising result rather than a great one. President Xi of China is the one man who might persuade Putin to withdraw and he should make every effort do so. Meanwhile, the rest of the world must put a stranghold of sanctions around the Russian state. And NATO must stand firm and resolute.  The borders of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are the NATO red line. Putin must be left under no illusion about the lethal consequences of crossing it. Andthe Russian people are as truly opposed to this war as they appear to be, there is only one course of action open to them: to topple the man who caused it.

Some are reported to own luxury penthouses only steps away from ParliamentBillionaire London residents like Alisher Usmanov are facing calls for UK sanctions Image: REX ShutterstockByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Mar |comments London and the UK has long been home for Russian oligarchs attracted to its luxury lestyle. After the Soviet Union broke up in , oligarchs became rich by seizing state assets in the form of oil and gas reserves in cut-price deals.Several people became rich and the UK capital became something of a home as Western powers welcomed heavy investment from the newly rich businesspeople abroad.The problem is that to be rich in Russia often relies on close ties with Vladimir Putinaposs Kremlin in a relationship that is mutually beneficial. The state has the power to help out who it likes, while billionaire cash can be used for political campaigns and gaining influence.This very fact has been highlighted for a long time and the UK capital, dubbed aposLondongradapos, has long been associated with laundering dirty Russian money.Since war broke out in Ukraine, scrutiny over Russian money in London has intensied and people have been left wondering how so much cash could have landed this way. The UK government has now sanctioned a number of billionaires with ties to Putin. Who is Alisher Usmanov  Uzbek-born Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has commercial ties with Merseyside football club Everton and has had his assets frozen by the European Union.He owns USM Holdings, where Toffees owner Farhad Moshiri is the chairman, and is the th richest person in the world according to Forbes. His huge wealth is estimated to be over £ billion and is the reason he can afford a £ million Surrey Tudor mansion, though his main home is reported to be Beechwood House, north London.  He is best known in the UK for selling his % stake in Arsenal in . The -year-old was sentenced to six years in jail in , but years later the Uzbek court ruled the charges had been trumped up. He is quoted as saying: I am proud that I know Putin, and the fact that everybody does not like him is not Putinaposs problem. I donapost think the world loved Truman after Nagasaki. Who is Oleg Deripaska   Oleg Deripaska, , was sanctioned by the US in  over alleged links to the Russian government. He has voiced his support for an end to the war in Ukraine, but stopped short of directly condemning Putin. He said on Telegram: Peace is very important! Negotiations must begin as soon as possible!  Deripaska, who earned his wealth through founding the industrial group Basic Element, was once the richest person in Russia in . He nearly lost all of his wealth due to a market crash and massive debts. Despite legally challenging his sanctions, a Senate Intelligence Committee report from  lists Deripaska as close to ex-MI spy Christopher Steele and Donald Trumpaposs  campaign chair Paul Manafort. The billionaire owns a house in Belgrave Square. Who is Mikhail Fridman   Mikhail Fridman is another yet to add his name to the list of Russians condemning the war. He said: I do not make political statements, I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine. I am convinced however that war can never be the answer. This crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years.  He continued: While a solution seems frighteningly far off, I can only join those whose fervent desire is for the bloodshed to end. I’m sure my partners share my view. He was named by the US Treasury Department in names of  prominent Russians who increased their influence during the time of Putin. The list included members of Putinaposs cabinet as well as affluent business people and became known as the aposPutin listapos Fridman has now been sanctioned and named by the EU. Fridman bought Athlone House in North London for £ million in , now believed to be worth around £ million. The -year-old was born in the now Ukrainian city of Lviv and grew up to co-found Alfa-Group. Alfa Bank is the largest non-state controlled bank in Russia. Who is Igor Shuvalov   Igor Shugalov is reportedly an eccentric character and has publicly doted on his friend Putin. When not mocking Russians for living in small flats, he is known to fly his weaposs corgis around on a private jet, according to jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.  The dogaposs names, Navalny says, are Andvol Pinkerton, Andvol Tsesarevich, Andvol Ostap Bender, Andvol Hugo Boss, Andvol Iaposm Your Idol and Fox Pack Gabby Joy of Elves. Navalny also claims that the politician, now  and once a part of Putinaposs government as First Deputy Prime Minister, owns a flat in Westminsteraposs Whitehall Court, close to Downing Street. He once said: If a Russian feels any foreign pressure, he will never give up his leader. Never. We will survive any hardship in the country - we will eat less food, use less electricity or, I donapost know, some other things we are all used to. Who has the UK government announced sanctions against   The UK has so far sanctioned:Gennady Timchenko Boris Rotenberg Igor Rotenberg Pyotr Fradkov Kirill Shamalov Denis Bortnikov Elena Alexsanderovna Georgieva Yury SlyusarDespite calls from Welsh Labour MP Chris Bryant to sanction Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich, the UK government has not taken this step.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry loop sportive announced","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe popular Kilberry Loop Sportive will take place on Saturday August  this year.Organised by Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle Club and local man John Hardie, the -mile open road event starts and finishes in Tarbert.Registered as an event with British Cycling, the fun, friendly Kilberry Loop Sportive is targeted at every level of cyclist.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"council backs argyll events in covid recovery","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowCowal Highland Gathering is to receive a £, grant from Argyll and Bute Council as it prepares to take place in person for the first time in three years.The event, at Dunoon Stadium in August, had to take place virtually in  and  due to the Covid- pandemic.But preparations are being made for the  event to take place from August -, and it is the only event recommended to receive more than £, from round four of the council’s strategic events and festivalsfund.The Mull Rally has been recommended to receive £,, Mull of Kintyre Music and Arts Festival is earmarked for £, and the Tiree Wave Classic is in line for £,.Seven other events across Argyll and Bute are recommended to receive smaller grants.Councillors approved the recommended grant awards at the virtual meeting of the authority’s policy and resources committee on February .Eleven events across culture, sport and the arts will receive support totalling £, from round four of the council#s fund.The total budget available for   is more than £,.Councillors agreed to make remaining SEF funds, estimated to be £,, available to apply for.Receiving £, grant awards are Jura Music Festival, the Gathering of Cowal Clans and Helensburgh Winter Festival.The Highlands and Islands Music and Dance Festival will get £,, West Highland Yachting Week £, and Inveraray Highland Games £,.Tarbert Seafood Festival has also been recommended for £, despite being £ over the  per cent criteria.The report says it is felt this #does not prejudice the other applications# and the funding is available.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for economic growth said: #Events and festivals have played an important part in the economic health of Argyll and Bute in past years.

It’ll leave yet another small crater on the moon.”The moon already bears countless craters but with little to no real atmosphere, the moon is defenceless against the constant barrage of meteors and asteroids, and the occasional incoming spacecraft, including a few intentionally crashed for science’s sake.With no weather, there is no erosion and so impact craters last forever.Tracking deep space mission leftovers like this is hard, said Mr McDowell.The moon’s gravity can alter an object’s path during flybys, creating uncertainty.And there is no readily available database, he said, aside from the ones “cobbled together” by himself, Mr Gray and a couple of others.“We are now in an era where many countries and private companies are putting stuff in deep space, so it’s time to start to keep track of it.

increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season.

The only way to keep Scotland safe from Tory cuts is to become an independent country, with the full powers needed to build a fairer society."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 18 2022","story":"It was one of several nature shots Graham took during a winter break in Kintyre.If you have a photograph you would like to share, please email it to editor@campbeltowncourier or get in touch via the Courier#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"pupils prepare for league matches","story":"Kick off is at pm.The Pupils will be hoping to continue their away day joy from two weeks ago when they secured a - victory at Glenvale.The Pupils then have another away trip scheduled the following Saturday, February , against St Peter#s in Renfrew.Then, the Pupils# conclusion to their league season sees them play four home matches in a row.For more information on everything from fixture information and matchday photography to club fundraising and the upgrades to Kintyre Park, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter and Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week february 18 2022","story":"Instinctively, I would answer: #Doubt.#But is that right  The opposite of faith is surely not doubt, but certainty. If you are sure you know something to be the case beyond contradiction, you don#t need faith.Doubt, on the other hand, is strongly linked with faith because, while you may have faith strong enough to move mountains, there is always the possibility your faith is misplaced.I would argue the existence of God is proven by large amounts of evidence, but in the end that is a matter of faith.The Bible recognises this right at the start where Adam and Eve leave the Garden of Eden and do not see God face-to-face anymore.From now on, they, and we who come after them, must live by faith.This is what it is to be human – and faith is always open to challenge.When suffering occurs, when disaster looms, people ask, #Where was God # and use what has happened to deny God exists.Yet the faithful keep believing. Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"oban golfer bob shines in californian sun","story":"With  top  world-ranking players in the field, the honorary Machrihanish Golf Club member was going head-to-head with the one of the strongest fields assembled outside a major championship.Having shown signicant signs of ato form in his previous two tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, this was a chance for the left hander to build on his progress and climb back towards the top  in the world rankings.An opening level par  on Thursday left Bob in the middle of the pack after day one.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen

The project team would like to highlight that the mocked-up photograph was produced to illustrate the scale and impact of a major flood event on Musselburgh, and is derived from the council’s new Scheme Hydraulic Model.It is understood that this specic location, by St Peter’s Kirk, has flooded on at least four occasions in recent memory: , ,  and , with the event of  being the smallest event. Alongside the mocked-up photograph that Mr Taylor describes as “fake news”, the project placed an image of actual flooding from  at this location. No photographs exist from the other events however, it has been determined that the event of August  was equivalent to the one-in--years flood event from today and that the flood waters that day would only have been approximately mm lower than shown in the mocked-up image.The project team would like to highlight that the scale of water that would flow down the River Esk and or inundate the town during these events is almost unimaginable to anyone that has not experienced such an event – this is not considered a “cataclysmic” flood scenario as described by Roger Crofts on February : Musselburgh has a very high level of flood risk today as it did in , and this will get worse in future years due to the impact of climate change. The scheme’s flood maps are equivalent to the flood risk mapping previously undertaken by SEPA and which is available at their website.Mr Taylor also stated that “four bridges will be demolished at a cost of £ million, which will effectively cut off one part of town from the other”. The project team would like to highlight that at no point has the council ever considered removing and not replacing existing structures, as the importance of connectivity within the town is clearly understood. The project team would like to highlight that at this point, no decision has yet been taken on the form and design of these replacement structures.The council are comfortable that the scheme already includes a suite of flood risk reduction measures that include natural, sustainable and catchment measures. This includes: a debris trap by Whitecraig as requested by Roger Crofts on a number of occasions modication to existing Victorian reservoirs in the South Esk catchment to hold flood waters away from Musselburgh and protection of the Musselburgh coastline to allow the sand to continue to build-up naturally.The project team are, however, clear that Musselburgh cannot be protected without new defences along the River Esk’s banks through the town and along the coastal foreshore. The design of the scheme is not yet started, therefore any rumours of m-high concrete walls are not considered a valid concern.The project team will be in The Brunton on March  to continue to consult the town before the outline design commences.

Males have a chestnut-brown back, light brown chest with black spots, and a prominent grey-blue head and tail, whilst females are unormly brown. Like most members of the falcon family, the kestrel is equipped with black eyes. The purpose of this is to reduce the amount of glare entering the bird’s eye and improves vision, especially in bright light.Kestrels are mostly distinguished by their typical hunting technique, hovering -m above the ground, either by flying into the wind and using its fanned tail and pointy wings to hold position, or by soaring using the lt caused by a ridge or a similar obstacle. The bird keeps its eyes constantly fixed on the ground and, when it eventually spots prey, it swoops down and kills using the side of the beak rather than using talons like hawks do.The kestrel’s hunting skills are enhanced by incredible eyesight. These birds can see ultraviolet colour that is invisible to the human eye! This means they can easily locate their prey by detecting a rodent’s urine trail, which shines brightly in ultraviolet.Apart from watching kestrels in the air, they can also be seen perched on a tree branch, fences, lampposts or wires.These birds mainly feed on field voles, which constitute most of their diet, but can also take mice, shrews, small birds and occasionally worms or large insects .Kestrels do not build nests but instead they lay eggs in natural cavities such as holes in trees or cracks in clfs. If you live in the countryside, a good way of encouraging kestrels to the area is to put up nest boxes for them. Each bird species has dferent requirements when it comes to nest boxes, so it is worth researching online as to what the right measurements should be. Feel free to get in touch with myself as well!With just a little bit of patience, kestrels can be easily spotted. Once you have learned their hover style, you will not mistake it for anything ! Another good tip for looking for kestrels is to remember that they are birds of habit –you saw them perched on a tree in the local park, try going there again at a similar time, there is a huge chance they will be around!In East Lothian, I have two favourite kestrel spots: one is in Musselburgh Lagoons and the other one at The Grove. I visit those places fairly frequently at dferent times of the day to give myself a greater chance of photographing the birds in dferent light, but it is worth remembering that birds are most active at dawn and dusk.So far, I have found kestrels surprisingly relaxed with my presence however, I would not feel confident to say whether all kestrels are like this orI have been lucky. The rule of the thumb is to remain respectful of an animal’s space and never to disturb them I always move slowly when taking steps towards an animal and never in a straight line, so it does not feel challenged. After each step, I remain in the same position for quite some time before taking a further step – this way an animal can get used to me and stops treating me as a threat. I always use this approach, no matter which animal I photograph.As spring is just around the corner and soon wildle will be in full swing, I wish you all good luck in wildle spotting!If you would like to share some wildle sightings with me or want to know more about kestrels, please get in touch:www.zanslenswww.facebook zanslenswww zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"lothian-buses-x5-service-soon-return-east-lothian","story":"Lothian Buses suspended the X service, which links North Berwick, Dirleton, Aberlady, Gullane and Longniddry with the capital, almost two years ago at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.Craig Hoy, South Scotland MSP, has repeatedly called in recent months for the service to be reinstated.He handed over a petition, which was signed by more than , people, calling for the service to be brought back to the bus company.Mr Hoy, who is also a councillor for the Haddington and Lammermuir ward on East Lothian Council, was pleased to say the bid for the service toseemed to be heading in the right direction.Nigel Serafini, the interim chief executive of Lothian Buses, wrote to the politician to update him on the situation.He said: “We are only just covering existing service levels but with an uplt of new recruits due to begin in the business shortly, we are hopeful that we will soon be in a position to announce a date for theof the service.“This does however critically hinge on no further outbreaks or changes to guidance in the coming weeks.“As always, we continue to review our network provision and remain committed to restoring services where circumstances allow.”In the absence of the X, people commuting into Edinburgh on the bus can face an extra hour being added on to their journey as they travel through Musselburgh and Portobello towards the city centre.In contrast, after passing through Longniddry, the X heads onto the A and into the capital.Mr Hoy welcomed the latest development and was keen to see further progress being made.He said: “I am pleased that Lothian Buses have now responded to the petition calling for the reinstatement of the X service, and I am delighted that they are looking at providing a date for theof the service ‘soon’.“The X bus was a popular service in the local community providing a direct and convenient route into the centre of Edinburgh in under an hour.”"},{"url":null,"title":"travelodge-set-sights-north-berwick","story":"The hospitality giant declared its intent to build new hotels across the UK by publishing online its \"UK target map\" ­- and North Berwick was one of  highly sought-after locations identied across Scotland, including the Isle of Skye and Loch Lomond.It is not the first time that a budget hotel for the town has been mooted.Plans for a -bedroom hotel close to Tesco, off Tantallon Road - next to a new care home - were approved by East Lothian Council in  but the hotel element was scrapped last year.The care home at the site, formerly the long-standing home of James Mitchell Cars, is currently under construction.Judy Lockhart-Hunter, chairperson of the North Berwick Community Council said: \"It is great to hear that businesses want to invest in North Berwick.\"Particularly during high season, hotel rooms in North Berwick are like gold dust.\"Someone like Travelodge would be able to increase the number of hotel rooms available, offering more choice for potential visitors to the town.\"It will be interesting to hear more, particularly the location being considered.\"It is not yet clearTravelodge - which opened  new hotels in the UK last year - has any interest in the Tantallon Road site or has eyed up any other locations in North Berwick. A Travelodge spokesperson said: \"North Berwick is a target location for Travelodge and we are currently looking for a suitable hotel site.\""},{"url":null,"title":"new-kitchen-cliff-top-cafe-given-go-ahead-along-electric-bike-rental-firm-site","story":"Drt cafe, east of North Berwick, was launched by husband-and-we Stuart and Jo McNicol, of adjacent Castleton Farm, in .And despite the Covid- pandemic, it has gone from strength to strength, welcoming thousands of visitors each year.Now the farm has been granted planning permission for  ‘modular buildings’ which will be used as a bakery for the cafe, as well creating farm offices and providing a home to an electric bike rental firm.Like Drt, e-bike company Ez-Riders has been described by planners as a farm ersication project which will generate new tourism and visitors to the area.Granting approval for the additional buildings in the farmyard, planning officers said that the application had received one objection from the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland.Drt cafe has picturesque views of the Bass Rock from the clf edge.

He has put Tommy Shelby on the wagon. Believe it, brother.Only an event of seismic proportions could have brought such a change in a character. Sure enough , as we catch up with everyone’s favourite back street razor gang turned criminal big shots, the worst has happened to Tommyand the rest of the family. Aunt Pol, played in glorious fashion by Helen McCrory, is no more.It was not a change anyone wanted to make, but in real le, a place crueller than any fiction, McCrory died last year. Her character deserved an exit fit for a Gypsy Queen. She got it.The deed done, the action shts forward four years. Tommy Shelby is in his usual striding mode, head down, meaning business, a black dogby his side. He’s a long way from Birmingham, though, in Miquelon Island, Newfoundland.Though prohibition is over Tommy has big plans for the ships that ran booze to America. To that end he is meeting Michael Gray, Polly’s son, who blames Tommy for his mother’s death and has sworn to have his revenge.Thus the stage is set for a final sub-Shakespearean showdown between the ambitious young prince, Michaeland Tommy’s king.But what of the other players who have strutted and fretted their hour upon the Peaky Blinders stage  Brother Arthur, sister Ada, Tommy’s we Lizzie, Johnny Dogs, and the rest  They too have been changed by Pol’s death, Arthur most of all. Poor Arthur, half man, half grenade. How can Tommy hope to conquer America without all the family by his side If this is the end for Peaky Blinders on television – there are plans for a movie though– then where better for the Sopranos of Small Heath to bow out than America  Only in America would mobsters like the mighty Jack Nelson, whose acquaintance we have yet to make but whose legend precedes him, mix with presidents.America suits Peaky Blinders in other ways. This has always been a show with cinematic ambition. Indeed, Knight premiered the first episodes, back in , at the Edinburgh Film Festival. From the slo-mo swagger of the central characters and the drop dead stylish clothes, to the modern music applied to a period setting, it was obvious this was a small screen drama with big ideas.While it has stumbled occasionallyPeaky Blinders has built an army of devoted followers. If this firing on all cylinders opener is a guide, this could be the best series yet."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-worlds-best-hope-lies-russian-people","story":"I well remember the confrontation between the USSR and the US when nuclear warfare was on the brink and both sides were pumping up the rhetoric, with US nuclear armed bombers heading towards Russia while the USSRs missiles were being primed in Cuba. False or misunderstood messages could have led to Armageddon and almost did, when a USSR submarine commander was wrongly advised that an attack on his country had commenced and only the bravery of the third officer required to arm a nuclear missile for firing, in refusing to do so, saved the day.Mr Eadies use of the word lunacy in relation to Mr Putin is pertinent andindeed he is deranged, dramatic reactions by the West are more likely to inflame rather than defuse the situation. Surely the best hope is that the worldwide sanctions on Russia will persuade the Russian people to take action to remove this despot who has made their country a pariah and isolated them from all political, commercial, social and sporting links with the outside world. Thousands have already demonstrated their rejection of Mr Putins actions on the streets of Russias cities, risking the fate of the , already arrested for doing so.In closing, as someone a decade older than JA Smith , and having been opposed to nuclear weapons all my le – I witnessed the horric effects of their use in Japan – I remain steadfastly against them as a so-called deterrent and find it sad that any satisfaction could be derived from thinking that in the worst possible scenario the retaliatory killing of millions of other innocents would occur.James Graham, Clydebank.WE SHOULD EXPAND NATOIN recent weeks Vladimir Putin seemed like a psychopath, but one in touch with reality who made rational calculations. I thought perhaps we could come to a compromise with him on Ukraine being made a permanently neutral country, infor ending the Russian invasion.His threats of war against Finland and Sweden using the same pretext , and his attempt to annex the whole of Ukraine, show he’s neither rational nor responding to perceived threats to Russia. Finland and Sweden have been neutral countries ever since the Second World War ended. Only Russian threats could change that.Within days, both countries had responded, rationally enough, by sending arms to the Ukrainians, becausehe wins in Ukraine, he’ll come for them next.Mr Putin’s demand that Nato leave all former Soviet bloc states or he’ll force them to can’t be dismissed as posturing any more. He believes he can reimpose Russian domination of these countries by war and threats of war.If he isn’t deterred or defeated he’ll invade all the neutral countries in Europe, then likely trigger World War Three by invading Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.Nato should rapidly admit all remaining neutral countries that want to join, and get US, British or French troops deployed in them as a deterrent. Ukraine obviously is an exception, asit joined we could be in World War Three right away, but the more support and arms it’s given the better. Leaving him with a pretext to attack neutral countries but no deterrent against doing so will mean more Ukraines.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.BLAME THE FAILED POLITICIANSIN my letime the countries of the \"West\", actually the United States and Britain, have started more wars, invaded and bombed more countries than you can shake a stick at. They have overthrown more governments and installed more dictators than Vladimir Putin ever has.The justication for this is iniably the need to remove some madman or make the world \"safe for democracy\". I dont recall Allende in Chile as falling into the category of madman. Chile, however, has the geographical misfortune of being in the continent of America and therefore falls within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine, meaning the US feels entitles to a free hand to act in the interests of freedom and democracy business and rapacious capitalism, take your pick.Is this war Putins war or Russias war  This is up for debate what is not up for debate is that the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine could only arise in a world suffering from an absence of effective and meaningful institutions and mechanisms for conflict resolution and negotiation. In this vacuum figures such as George W Bush, Boris Johnson, President Putin, Donald Trump and Tony Blair strut the world stage. Mr Trump, the leader of the \"Free World\" for four years, actually tried to overthrow his countrys political and constitutional system, Mr Blair routinely lied to Parliament while Mr Johnson couldnt distinguish the truth from the Erskine Bridge. I would, to coin a phrase, go die in a ditchI felt I had any values, western or not, in common with someone like Mr Trump.Some of the recent letters in The Herald on the subject of nuclear weapons have, quite bluntly, been disgraceful. As for democracy, in this country it is something that ordinary men and women have fought for it, is not something that fair-minded politicians have gted. It is something that Mr Johnson with his attempt to prorogue Parliament and Mr Blair with his culture of spin have sought to undermine.It is a central part of Russian history that it has no tradition of elective politics or institutions based on this practice an eminent historian of the country has suggested this is why the revolutions of  and  failed. Expanding Nato and missile deployment wont assist progress in Russia. Building strong international institutions and repudiating politicians like Messrs Bush, Trump, Blair and Johnson might be a start.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.WE MUST NEVER GIVE UP HOPEWITH the despicable assault on Ukraine continuing I remember, as a young man with tears in my eyes, being restrained from travelling to Hungary in , as the Russian tanks blasted their way into Budapest.More than a decade later in  the same happened in Prague. However, in the late s the Soviet Empire began to disintegrate and by the s democratic freedoms ed.Therefore, as the madness of one man explodes over Ukraine, we must never give up hope in the ultimate goodness of mankind. As we salute the courage of Ukraine let us support its people, in every way possible, remembering there is more good in the world than evil and that hate is always the loser.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.WE NEED THE UK UMBRELLATHE SNPs defence spokesman, Stewart McDonald, has boldly and righteously stated that previous armed forces cuts by the UK Government were a “mistake” and “short-sighted”. This from a member of the SNP that wants to get rid of Trident from Faslane and wants independence which could and more than likely would result in Scotland being outside Nato.Further, quite where Mr McDonald would grow the money tree to provide the necessary resources to fund Scotland’s defences and armed forces is anyone’s guess. If we ever needed convincing that the UK as a whole and as part of Nato can demonstrate strong defences it is now in the face of the most dangerous military action in Europe since the Second World War. Mr McDonald would do well to remember, that at this time, he can make such comments under the umbrella of UK security.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.FOLLOW THE EUS EXAMPLEWHAT a mean-spirited letter from Jane Lax , who grudges the Scottish Government giving humanitarian aid to Ukraine in this most desperate of times. I think that the vast majority of the compassionate, generous Scottish public will support the Scottish Governments aid package to Ukraine, and I would point out to Ms Lax, who contends that the First Minister is letting down people on our streets, that the Tory Government cut Universal Credit by £ per week, while the SNP Government is doubling the Scottish Child Payment, along with other measures to combat poverty.Nicola Sturgeon is also right to plead that anyone from Ukraine fleeing for their lives should be welcomed to the UK, and that \"the paperwork can be sorted out later on\". On top of its historic announcement that it is sending weapons to Ukraine as well as humanitarian aid, the EUs announcement that all its member countries will take in Ukranian refugees for up to three years without needing to apply for asylum is truly admirable, and should be emulated without delay by the UK Government.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: Sturgeon is letting down her own people"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13526917.jpg?type=article-full","title":"campaign-prevent-unthinkable-loss-historic-scottish-reformation-church","story":"The historic lead-clad spire of St Johns Kirk which has dominated the city of Perths skyline is under threat from the elements with a repair bill spiralling estimated to run into thousands of pounds.The church is noted for being the site of John Knoxs  sermon against idolatry, which began the Scottish Reformation.The Scottish Reformation was the process by which Scotland broke with the Papacy and split the church into Catholic and Protestant factions, creating two roads to salvation - both of which claimed to be true.Expert surveys of the Category A listed building built around , carried out in  identied water entering through failing lead-work, causing damage to ancient timbers supporting the spire.Safety concerns have resulted in the removal of the Kirk spires golden cockerel weather vane by steeplejacks and the structure was capped by a lead cover.Now, however, cash-strapped church officials have revealed growing concerns for the  ft high steeple - which dates back to the early s - and are seeking financial support to save one of the Perths oldest standing building from further decay.St Johns Kirk property convener John Kinloch said doing nothing was no longer an optionthe Kirks spire is to be saved.\"Water continues to find its way into the spire and the full extent of the problem wont be known until specialist investigators can safely access the area,\" he said.\"Provision of a safe access at height is a costly proposition and the estimated cost of repairs could mushroom beyond the original estimate of up to £, once we determine the full extent of what were dealing with.\"It seems certain that St Johns Kirk faces a huge financial pressure to safeguard the future of this city landmark.\"Specialist advice has been commissioned and the Kirk Session has committed up to £, of repair works.\"The most important thing is to keep the structure safe and that is why the cockerel finial was removed and part of the lead cladding,\" said Mr Kinloch.\"Action - both short and long-term - is vital so the Kirk Session is investing most of its available funds in a bid to combat decay of the spire.

The spire rises to the golden cockerel weathervane,  feet above the pavement and has been a landmark over Perth for more than  years.The original lead sheeting was blown down in a gale in , and replaced by the town council.

There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-. Monday-Friday with an amended menu.Given the infection levels, the council will be maintaining all current related COVID  restrictions for the time being, including working from homeyou can, and this will be reviewed again during March.A spokeswoman for NHS Orkney added: “We praise the community for their continued, regular use of lateral flow tests and urge everyone to continue using these. Particularly before meeting up with family, friends, travelling and attending events.“Logging lateral flow results is just as important and we ask you all to log both negative and positive results. When a positive lateral flow test is logged you will then receive information on isolation etc.“We’re continuing to ask all NHSO health care staff to continue with lateral flow testing when coming to work and this will be in place for the time being.”You can log your results by visiting: www.gov.uk report-covid-resultcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This can not be allowed to happen, Russian trade is not welcome in our waters.#This is an insult to the Ukraine, to its people and to all Ukrainians living in the UK. We must not support Russian-owned trade vessels in any capacity. Help by signing this petition to put a stop to Russian owned vessels docking at UK ports now.#Amid calls for the vessel to be refused access, and for key services such as tugs and pilotage to be refused, Orkney Islands Council said: #As a council we are in an extremely dficult position. We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share — but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.#We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.#We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.#The petition can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This stems from the  Harbours Act which states that any harbour may be open to all for the shipping of goods.“But in my view is this is so very dferent. Can you imagine Churchill complying with Victorian legislation and allowing a vessel owned by a hostile nation into the Flow “We have a proud maritime history in Orkney, and we should play our part and issue an immediate ban on all Russian vessels entering our harbours. This would be a peaceful but very effective act.”Councillor Sankey intends to liaise with OIC officers, his councillor colleagues and politicians early next week to see how this visit can be stopped. He says he can’t condone OIC services of any type assisting the vessel.“Whilst we may by law have to allow access, there’s no law that says our pilot boats and tugs should be used, and I’m deeply unhappy about our harbour assets helping a Russian ship under current circumstances,” adds Councillor Sankey.In a statement provided to The Orcadian on Saturday, Orkney Islands Council said the authority is an “extremely dficult position.”A spokeswoman said: ”We recognise the strength of feeling around this — feelings that we share —  but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK Government tells us otherwise.“We have sought urgent advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have told us that the current sanctions do not cover this operation.”We continue dialogue both with elected representatives and Government departments on this situation as we seek to clary what possible further action can be taken.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Together we have achieved some incredible things and I am very grateful for his friendship and dedication over the last  years.“While he might be leaving the professional team, he will always be family and I can’t thank him enough for all he has done.”Vajda’s scaled-back role enabled him to spend more time at home but the -year-old hinted he is keen for another coaching job.“During my time with Novak, I have been lucky to watch him transform into the player he is today,” he said. “I will look back on our time together with immense pride and am so very thankful for the success we have achieved. I remain his biggest support on and off the court and look forward to new challenges.”These are undoubtedly dficult times for Djokovic, who lost the world number one ranking to Daniil Medvedev on Monday and has played only one tournament this season.Following his deportation from Australia, Djokovic ed to the court in Dubai last week but suffered a shock quarter-final loss to Jiri Vesely.If he remains unvaccinated against coronavirus, as he appears determined to do, the big ATP Tour events in Indian Wells and Miami look off the table while the European clay tournaments that follow are also far from straightforward.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

When I speak with my players and in my team I say that we have to think about ‘us’, not ‘me’.“For me no problem and for me there is the desire, the will, the patience to try to continue to work very hard to improve, to make this team more stable than the past, because I think this is the key that can change the situation.“I try every day through the work. Also sometimes to speak. For sure in this type of situation you need to find the right key to go into the mind of the players, because it’s not only sometimes a tactical problem or a technical problem.”“Sometimes you have to try to work and to push in other aspects, the mental aspects and try to stay focused and to work also on the training sessions, to keep focusing.”🎙 “There is only one way, to continue to work very hard with the players.”Antonio Conte reflects on tonights defeat. pic ofAsDwrLu— Tottenham HotspurMarch , Conte again explained his dramatic reaction to the Burnley defeat was a strategic decision and said he has to find the best way of getting the most out of his players.“Sometimes you have to be strong, sometimes light. My old coaches in Italy, especially Carletto Mazzone, taught me that the coach sometimes has to use the carrot, sometimes the stick,” he said.“I have to try the right way at the inidual moment. After Burnley, I used the stick and we won! After Leeds, the carrot, we lost.“I repeat: the coach has to try to find always the best solution, not because you’re upset, frustrated and disappointed. At every moment the situation has to be very clear.“I know there’s a lot of space for improvement for this team and we have to try to be more stable. Tonight we showed that we have a lot of space for improvement in this aspect.”As much as the story will be about Tottenham’s exit, Middlesbrough were worthy winners and showed their elimination of Manchester United in the last round was no fluke.They were by far the better team and could have won in normal time but for a number of missed chances. vw,vw,px, px\"Chris Wilder, centre, celebrates the win with his players Something special could be brewing under Chris Wilder, who has already got Boro back in the Championship promotion mix, as they reached the last eight of the FA Cup for the first time since .Wilder said: “I am very proud of the performance of everybody, I thought the energy that the supporters gave the team was outstanding, it was my first experience of a packed Riverside and it was amazing. The team rose to the occasion.“I am an honest manager in my assessment of the game – I would have been deeply disappointedwe had not won that game tonight, I thought we did more than enough to win against a top side with an outstanding manager and some brilliant iniduals in it.“To turn over one of the favourites for the competition in the fth round is a brilliant achievement.“ just shows the elation of a young footballer getting a winner for his hometown club in the fth round against Tottenham Hotspur, that will live for a long time in the memory of Josh.“It is a great moment for Josh, his opportunity came about and it was brilliant for him to smash home the winner.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

But Chinese officials are dubious it is theirs.No matter whose it is, scientists expect the object to carve out a hole ft to ft across and send moon dust flying hundreds of miles across the barren, pockmarked surface. vw,vw,px, px\"A leftover rocket is expected to smash into the far side of the moon Low-orbiting space junk is relatively easy to track.Objects launching deeper into space are unlikely to hit anything and these far-flung pieces are usually soon forgotten, except by a handful of observers who enjoy playing celestial detective on the side.SpaceX originally took responsibility for the forthcoming lunar litter after asteroid tracker Bill Gray identied the collision course in January.He corrected himself a month later, saying the “mystery” object was not a SpaceX Falcon rocket upper stage from the  launch of a deep space climate observatory for Nasa.Mr Gray said it was likely to be the third stage of a Chinese rocket that sent a test sample capsule to the moon and back in .But Chinese officials said the upper stage had re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and burned up.But there were two Chinese missions with similar designations – the test flight and ′s lunar samplemission – and US observers believe the two are getting mixed up.The US Space Command, which tracks lower space junk, confirmed Tuesday that the Chinese upper stage from the  lunar mission never deorbited, as previously indicated in its database.But it could not confirm the country of origin for the object about to strike the moon.“We focus on objects closer to the Earth,” a spokesman said in a statement.Jonathan McDowell of the Hard and Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics supports Mr Gray’s revised assessment, but notes: “The effect will be the same. It’ll leave yet another small crater on the moon.”The moon already bears countless craters but with little to no real atmosphere, the moon is defenceless against the constant barrage of meteors and asteroids, and the occasional incoming spacecraft, including a few intentionally crashed for science’s sake.With no weather, there is no erosion and so impact craters last forever.Tracking deep space mission leftovers like this is hard, said Mr McDowell.The moon’s gravity can alter an object’s path during flybys, creating uncertainty.And there is no readily available database, he said, aside from the ones “cobbled together” by himself, Mr Gray and a couple of others.“We are now in an era where many countries and private companies are putting stuff in deep space, so it’s time to start to keep track of it. Right now there’s no-one, just a few fans in their spare time.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Credit: Harland  Wolff TwitterAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe fate of a huge oil tanker in a Belfast shipyard is uncertain after the Government said UK ports should refuse access to Russian boats.The Eduard Toll docked at Harland  Wolff’s shipyard earlier this month — where it is currently being worked on — before the invasion of Ukraine.The mammoth liquefied natural gastanker is the largest to enter the shipyard in recent years, and dwarfs Harland  Wolff’s most famous vessel, the ill-fated Titanic.It is designed to operate year-round from Russia’s Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to .m thick. Harland  Wolff on Monday night said it will “continue to support the UK Government’s position”, following Transport Secretary Grant Schapps’ call for all UK ports to deny access to Russian flagged, registered or operated vessels.Mr Shapps tweeted on Monday: “Given Putin’s action in Ukraine I’ve made clear these vessels are NOT welcome here with prohibiting legislation to follow.”In a letter to UK ports, he said the maritime sector “must play our part” in sanctioning Russia over Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Russia’s assault on Ukraine is an unprovoked, premeditated attack against a sovereign democratic state. The UK Government has been clear there would be massive consequences and a severe cost for any Russian military incursion into Ukraine, and, in co-ordination with our international allies and partners, we are developing an unprecedented package of further sanctions,” he said.“The maritime sector is fundamental to international trade and we must play our part in restricting Russia’s economic interests and holding the Russian government to account.“In these circumstances the Department for Transport does not consider it appropriate for Russian vessels to continue to enter UK ports.“From this point onwards, UK ports are asked not to provide access to any ship which they have reason to believe is: owned, controlled, chartered, or operated by any person connected with Russia owned, controlled, chartered or operated by designated persons flying the Russian flag registered in Russia.“We will seek to support UK ports in identying Russian ships within scope of the above and will communicate directly with relevant ports when we identy ships bound for UK ports who fall within scope of the above.“Further detailed sanctions against Russian shipping are being developed and further details will be shared very shortly.”Harland  Wolff said in a statement to the Belfast : “We are aware of a request issued by the Department for Transport instructing UK ports not to provide access to any ship which is owned or controlled by any person connected with Russia, flying the Russian flag or registered in Russia.“Harland  Wolff has a long tradition of working with UK Government and will continue to support the UK Government’s position.”It is unclear whether the UK Government’s request only concerns incoming Russian vessels, or also those already docked or undergoing repairs.It is also unclear whether or not the Eduard Toll — which measures up at a signicant draught of .m and aof m — we be allowed to leave the Belfast dock amid the current climate.Harland  Wolff’s Belfast shipyard is the site of one of Europe’s largest heavy engineering facilities with deep-water access, and also two of Europe’s largest dry docks. The famous shipyard was saved from closure back in  after being acquired by UK-based energy company Infrastrata. Following the acquisition of Harland  Wolffin August , the firm has focused on opportunities in both ship repair and shipbuilding.Related topicsUkraineMore On UkraineFuel prices soar in space of a week as crisis starts to hit NIDUP demand Sinn Fein ‘step back’ from ‘pro-Putin propaganda’ in response to Chris Hazzard tweetNI ports directed to ban all Russian vessels as Poots warns of food shortagesUkraine membership of European Union should be ‘accelerated’ claims SDLP’s Colum EastwoodNI writers to stage special fundraiser in show of solidarity with Ukrainian peersMost ReadLisburn luxury property oozing modern style includes home gymSchools# Cup semi-final: Methody smash Belfast rivals RBAI at Kingspan Stadium to reach St Patrick#s Day deciderFate of tanker in Belfast uncertain after ports told Russian vessels not welcomeBallymacbreenan Schoolhouse: Dream Lisburn home was well worth the -year wait pupils ‘left stranded’ after late suspension of Strangford ferryTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news fec .ece AUTOCROP wh beccbdc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news fec .ece AUTOCROP wh beccbdc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Woman arrested as murder investigation launched following west Belfast stabbingPlayFuel prices in Northern Ireland are at an all time high following the Russian invasion of UkrainePlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerLatest Northern IrelandLast-gasp Matthew Shevlin denies Larne to make his point for resilient ColeraineNorthern Ireland fans united with Irish FA in boycott against Russia to show solidarity with UkraineIain Henderson#s release from Ireland camp will be major boost for Ulster as Cardf come to BelfastFuel prices soar in space of a week as crisis starts to hit NIDecision to suspend initiative that would see firefighters respond to cardiac calls alongside ambulance service sparks outrageLatestAviva s another £.bn to investors despite annual profits fallingDeclan BogueOpinionDeclan Bogue: More must be done to tackle sectarian abuse faced by Ulster players during GAA gamesIrish League’s full-time clubs must also give young stars an education to fall back on: Bobby CarlisleLast-gasp Matthew Shevlin denies Larne to make his point for resilient ColeraineNorthern Ireland fans united with Irish FA in boycott against Russia to show solidarity with Ukraine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Any rumours that there are on such are entirely without foundation. There is no evidence base for such.“I wasn’t aware of what happened and, therefore, couldn’t have been the source.“In fact, I was somewhat shocked when I heard that had happened, and I didn’t hear that had happened until last Wednesday, when the story was broken.”Askedhe was disappointed when he learned of the meeting, Mr Poots replied: “Well, that’s an internal party matter. I’ll have those discussions with party colleagues at this stage, but it was news to me.”Earlier yesterday, the Agriculture Minister took to social media to set the record straight, saying his name had been “mentioned a number of times” as the source of leaked information. Neither he nor people who supported his leadership were aware of the meeting, Mr Poots said. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He asked the media to “desist from spreading myths which have zero substance on behalf of people seeking to cause ision in the DUP”.Details of a meeting between the unionist leaders emerged last week, but Sir Jeffrey described any suggestion he was about to join the UUP as nonsense.He said Mr Beattie approached him because he was keen to poach him.At the meeting, Sir Jeffrey explained, Mr Beattie called on him to consider rejoining the UUP. They also discussed issues about the future of unionism, he added.Sir Jeffrey has maintained that he politely declined the offer and vowed to continue engagement with unionists from across all parties and work towards achieving greater cooperation.However, Mr Beattie insisted that his DUP counterpart agreed to the meeting knowing his potential defection to the UUP was at the top of the agenda.He said he has texts of exchanges with Sir Jeffrey and would act to protect his integrityhis version of events was challenged.It is understood that the meeting took place in the privacy of an army barracks.The discussions were held shortly after Sir Jeffrey was narrowly beaten in a leadership contest by Mr Poots.However, Mr Poots held the job for just  days. By the end of June, Sir Jeffrey was party leader.Mr Poots recently failed to secure the party’s nomination to run in South Down in the Assembly elections. He said that he had been engaged with Sir Jeffrey for two months on a process to ensure that the party leader couldto Stormont from Westminster at the elections in May.But at the beginning of February, DUP party officers selected Diane Forsythe as the candidate for South Down ahead of Mr Poots, who was attempting to switch to the constituency from Lagan Valley.South Down MLA Jim Wells previously indicated he believed the decision of the officers should be overturned and Mr Poots should still stand there.At the time, Mr Poots hit out at those within the DUP who had leaked details of the internal party selection processes to the media.Sir Jeffrey left the UUP in  along with Arlene Foster, having been a vocal critic of David Trimble and the Good Friday Agreement. He plans to run in Lagan Valley in the May Stormont election, which will allow him to become First Ministerhis party secures the most votes. Sir Jeffrey has said he wants Mr Poots to stand alongside him and Paul Givan in the Lagan Valley constituency, with a view to winning three seats.Most ReadLisburn luxury property oozing modern style includes home gymSchools# Cup semi-final: Methody smash Belfast rivals RBAI at Kingspan Stadium to reach St Patrick#s Day deciderFate of tanker in Belfast uncertain after ports told Russian vessels not welcomeBallymacbreenan Schoolhouse: Dream Lisburn home was well worth the -year wait pupils ‘left stranded’ after late suspension of Strangford ferryTop Videos\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news fec .ece AUTOCROP wh beccbdc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news fec .ece AUTOCROP wh beccbdc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Woman arrested as murder investigation launched following west Belfast stabbingPlayFuel prices in Northern Ireland are at an all time high following the Russian invasion of UkrainePlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerLatest Northern IrelandDecision to suspend initiative that would see firefighters respond to cardiac calls alongside ambulance service sparks outrageDrug addicts being left amputees after injecting cocaine, warns addiction expertRevealed: Co Tyrone woman jailed for £.m fraud sacked from previous job at bank for stealingFuel prices soar in space of a week as crisis starts to hit NIUnclearBallymena’s £, nuclear bunker still for saleLatestSpace junk on ,-mph collision course with moonCervical cancer vaccine recipients may only need one smear test in their livesOscar nominee Troy Kotsur on why it took two years to land CODA roleSydney braces for flash floods as rain disaster claims at least  livesWhat the papers say – March ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Craig Harkness, Ross Connolly and Darren Cassells on the wings were making super tackles when required, while Andrew Mullholand kept the opposition outside the circle.Bangor won a short corner, but Ballynahinch kept the ball out and go on the attack. Leslie Harrison found Alex Millar and he passed the ball to Hugo Melville who attacked up the right hand side before being stopped in his tracks.Before the end of the first quarter Bangor ed to the lsquoHinch circle and took the lead with a tap-in at the back post.With both sides now settled in, the second quarter was full of end to end action.

This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

On economic grounds it just did not measure up, and so it was shelved.ldquoThere is no doubt that the creation of a barrage would severely and irretrievably damaged the superb wildle of the Lough, altering the tidal regime, ruining feeding grounds, and in the process reducing muchthe scenic quality, said the Minister.KILLYLEAGH ndash A government minister is to be asked by Down councillors tomorrow to lt the embargo on marina development at Killyleagh.A deputation of councillors is hoping to persuade Economy Minister, Mr Richard Needham, to allow a marina development on the shores of Strangford Lough.The Minister will be told of the fears that Killyleagh is being turned into a ghost town because of substantial job losses in its industrial base ndash and the belief that a marina could hold out hope of a revival.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor. Mr Sam Osbourne, said ldquowhile we are meeting the Minister about the decision last August to refuse three separate applications for a marina, it goes much wider than that. There is a need for an overall plan for this town.ldquoThe whole place is badly run down and has probably never been at a lower ebb. Killyleagh is a ghost town now. We need some new source of employment and a marina linked to a hotel would be a big boost.DOWNPATRICK ndash Councillors targeting Downpatrickrsquos arts centre for closure may be prevented from carrying out their plans by the terms of the buildingrsquos lease.The -year lease on the building, which was agreed when the council took over the former Town Hall from Lord Dunleath, does not enable the council to sell the property andit is closed for more than  months the building will revert to its original owner.Under the terms agreed, the council took over the building on the basis it would be used solely for the purpose outlined in Article  of the Recreation and Youth Services Order.ldquoThis paragraph specically empowers councils to provide facilities for ldquorecreational, social, physical and cultural activities.The lease on the arts centre states that the owner, Lord Dunleath, would enforce his right to take back the building within  monthsits uses were outside the terms of that clause.This means that several years of council investment, eighteen months worth of running costs, and a pound, grant from the Department of Education would be wasted.DUNDRUM ndash Crisis-threatened Dundrum Regatta has been saved from collapse after villagers rallied to a special meeting last week.The Regatta, one of the oldest summer festivals in Northern Ireland, looked doomed earlier this month but an appeal by organisers has attracted increased community support and ensure the eventrsquos future.The special meeting was called after just five people attended the organising committeersquos annual meeting earlier this month.It was immediately adjourned and an appeal issued to villages to support the reconvened meeting, held in St Donardrsquos hall on Tuesday night.Committee chairman, Mr Paddy Cunningham said: ldquoI was very pleased to see the turnout had increased signicantly and we were able to proceed with the business of organising this yearrsquos Regatta..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Jimmy\u0027s 10k back  ","story":"ONE of the most prestigious races in the local running calendar is ing to the streets of Downpatrick after an absence of three years.Jimmyrsquos K, organised by East Down Athletic Club and supported by MB McGrady  Co, Chartered Accountants, will take place on Sunday, March .Given that it will be the opening race of the  K Grand Prix, and one of the first road running fixtures of the Athletics NI calendar, organisers are expecting a packed entry list.Jimmyrsquos K was last raced in Downpatrick in .

Improved disabled access is also part of the investment plan which will result in a number of paths being widened.Council officials say the planned improvements are essential for local people who are increasingly using the trails as part of their daily routine and commute.Since the start of the Covid pandemic, there has been a major increase in the number of people walking along the banks of the Quoile with this set to increase over the spring and summer.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Gareth Sharvin are delighted with the master plan and the benefit that it will provide for the town, its residents and visitors.Cllr Mason said due to Covid- restrictions, many areas across the district have experienced an increased use of outdoor spaces.ldquoThis has been so important for the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors to our area, she continued.ldquoThe Quoile in particular has been extremely busy with families and friends using the location for running, walking, cycling or simply meeting up with each other. The need for good quality outdoor space has never been as important.Cllr Hanlon said she was ldquoexcited to see the first phase of the local authorityrsquos Covid recovery scheme being rolled out.ldquoI am pleased the work will include enhancing boardwalks and paths at Jane Shore with improved disability access in particular at the gates which will be of particular interest to local anglers who have lobbied for better access, she said.ldquoThis work is vital in enhancing the tourist and heritage offerings we have locally and create better linkages to the town centre.Cllr Sharvin said the joint local authority and government department investment will signicantly improve access along the Janes Shore area and help disabled anglers in particular who have highlighted with him the challenges they face of accessing the walkway.ldquoThe planned improvements will enable everyone to enjoy the uniqueness of the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset, he said.Cllr Sharvin said work to resurface the footpath, replace wooden fencing and walking boards, in tandem with the provision of new accessibility gates and cutting back trees and hedging will make a major dference.He said the foliage will be cut back next month and when that is completed, it is hoped that work on the other planned improvements will get underway.The Quoile Angling Club is holding its annual meeting in Murphyrsquos bar, Downpatrick, on March  at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Preservation order put on hold pending planning application  ","story":"A DECISION to make a preservation order to protect trees at the centre of the Exploris Ropebridge car park project in Portaferry has been put on hold.The Department of Infrastructureconfirmed this week that it will wait for the outcome of a planning application before it decides what to do with the trees that local people are campaigning to save.Ards and North Down Borough Council lodged a planning application with its own planning department last December  to gain permission to build an extended car and coach on its own land near the popular visitor venue.The project has been controversial since local conservationists discovered last year that in order to build the car-park, nine mature protected trees would need to be removed.It was later confirmed that the council did not have the authority to remove the trees under a permitted development and needed to apply for planning permission for the car-park which should have been competed by next month.The Portaferry Stop The Trees campaign gathered more than , names in opposition to the trees cull and even offered the council an alternative design which would have saved the trees but resulted in less parking spaces. The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project. At the start of the regeneration scheme, the proposed costs were circa pound,, he said.ldquoHowever, with the passage of time, increased construction costs and refinement of the scheme , the costs were last estimated at circa pound, which was agreed by council in October .A DfI spokesperson confirmed it had initially considered making a preservation order on the trees.He added: ldquoHowever, on January  , the council confirmed that it had instead opted to submit a planning application. This was lodged on December  to the Planning Service of the council. The necessity of whether it is expedient to complete the process of making a TPO is on hold pending the outcome of the planning application..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Smell wind of change as lambs leap around fields  ","story":"IT is spring again in Lecale and new le abounds in the fields. Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted. I am asking the council to alleviate fears by confirming that the Festival of Flight hasnrsquot be shelved.

For example, we will also show respect and liberty toward those who wish to continue wearing face coverings, either entering or leaving our buildings or while seated for worship.“Our worship services are open to all – our own members and adherents, and also any from the public at large who wish to visit. We must emphasise our gratitude to the Lord for His mercy in bringing us to this point where church le is more back to full ministry at all levels.”• The Free Presbyterian general presbytery, in a statement this week, said: “We give thanks to God for looking upon the nation in mercy, and withdrawing the more extreme symptoms of the covid pandemic, which caused death and serious illness. “We are grateful for removal of all statutory restrictions upon our public worship and have authorised our sessions and committees to take the necessary steps, transitioning our people back to normality. We continue to pray for all who have been affected by the pandemic through bereavement and illness and that they will know God’s grace and comfort.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I do not expect political leaders to be saints and have only passing disappointment on learning of inappropriate tweets or the fact that a le long politician thinks of jumping ship when his party isn’t working for him anymore. I do have a harder time with politicians who become apologists for Irish people who killed other Irish people in the name of political change but we made a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement to move on from past resentments.

Self-interest led politicians promoting Brexit to reject the relationships that made the UK a successful global economy. The DUP got on the Brexit train knowing it could cost the Northern Ireland economy dear. They are now prepared to leave NI open to direct rule by this very Tory government who are failing so abysmally to take on Putin, who are responding to Ukraine’s humanitarian refugee crisis with empty words and red tape they prioritise keeping anti immigration rhetoric in place to appease right wing ERG supporters. So how do I stay proud of my country in the way the Ukrainian people can hold their heads high  We must not become a narrow minded, inward looking country. It is crucial that in May we do not elect in Northern Ireland parties that are only too happy to hand our futures to charlatans or who have tied their future to the success of Boris’s failed vision of an isolated lonely Britain.Dr Carol Greer, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.

It was silly, but to give Jimmy his due there was always a wee message in it, just like the work I do with the Gang today. “Always, each side of the community got an equal send up, again just like what we do with Give My Head Peace. It was all very even.“At that time I was still working in the court house for Antrim County Council because in those days, unless you were wealthy, actors could never afford to give up their day jobs. You were in the performing arts for the love of it.Olivia and her late husband Bill whom she married on June , . The couple went on to have one daughter, Patricia“I would come out of the court house like the clappers and get a bus up Royal Avenue to the Group Theatre. Sometimes we would do double shows for three weeks over Easter and over Christmas, but it was so much fun, you didn’t resent being so busy.“Every six months we changed the show, but when we would do two shows, the same people who were into theatre would be sitting there every single Saturday. People would come to the play at half six, go to John Long’s fish and chip shop for their tea and then sometimes be back in time for the second performance.”Olivia recalls that the love of her le, her late husband Bill, whom she met through the Larne Drama Circle, died of an aneurysm in .“Bill and I were always trying to get married, and I would say, ‘I’ll just do another play, Bill, and then we’ll get married.’ Olivia as a cherubic child. She began elocution lessons at the tender age of three and has been performing in one way or another ever since“We got married on June , , and got a flat, and we put every penny we got into it, and we just thought we were the bees’ knees. “Then in August of ‘ internment came in and absolutely everything stopped, the city went dark and the curtains came down in the theatres. No plays, nothing, and there was Bill and I sitting like two prunes, albeit in love.“There’s not a day goes by when I don’t miss him, but after his death I had to raise my daughter Patricia who was just ten then, and le had to go on. My love of acting sustained me.”She first joined Tim ‘and the boys’ on BBC NI’sPerforated Ulster and then came the call to join the cast of Give My Head Peace for what would go on to become the now iconic satirical series in  and ever since nobody has dared cross, or targe, the inimitable doyenne of the dramedy.‘I’M ACTUALLY VERY SHY OUTSIDE A ROLE’“At age three I was signed up to do elocution lesson,” says Olivia. “I was always used to standing up and speaking.“Basically though, and people may be very surprised by this, but I am actually very shy, and I hate going into rooms with people who I don’t really know, because I always think, ‘well why would they want to talk to me ’ “So I was always nervous, but I never had any qualms about going on stage and I always did a lot of public speaking.“At first, when I started to do it, I used to pretend that I was somebody , for about the first two minutes and that’s what got me through.“With drama you can be very shy, but when you take on a role you become somebody , and there’s a real liberation in that because you no longer feel self-conscious - you are transformed when you play a particular part.”Nash added: “When I left school, I joined Larne Drama Circle at the age of  and it was the making of me as a performer and to this day all of us are like family, my family outside my family - %.”‘IF YOU CAN MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH TOGETHER, THAT’S REALLY OVERCOMING DIVISION’Olivia, who starred in the iconic Billy Plays in the s alongside a very young Sir Kenneth Branagh and the late Jimmy Ellis, whom she remembers as an “absolute gentleman”, received her MBE in  not just for the rich tapestry of her theatre work but also for her uwavering support for the Northern Ireland Hospice for whom she has gone on innumerable fundraising walks and loves to visit to chat and entertain patients. She feels all of us could learn some perspective, namely “how to stop grumbling about things that don’t matter”, from witnessing the incredible work they do there.But today she feels blessed beyond measure, that besides working in radio which allows her to play a “tall, slim blonde” when she feels like it, she is delighted to be part of a show that frequently flags up the absurdity of our sectarian politics and entrenched, ludicrous ision where we could have unity and fraternity.”No disrespect to Stormont, butthe cast of Give My Head Peace had a half an hour up there, I think it would get politicians on both sides of the ide working together much better. “If I had a pound for all the times people stop me in the street and tell me how much Give My Head Peace made them laugh and upllted them, whatever circumstances they were going through, I would be very rich, and I feel very privilegedto have been allowed to be a part of something so wonderful, which I think very much shows that whether you are orange, green or neither, there is so much more that unites rather than ides us in Northern Ireland. “There is barely a day when somebody doesn’t shout out ‘Ma!’ to me in the street.”It’s obvious the gang are thick as thieves and Olivia tells an hilarious story about a programme special they did on the continent when she fell a*** over face into a freezer trying to retrieve some prawns, with a passerby having to pull her out by the ankles, which became comedy gold in one episode, and on a special set in Rome when they had the full humour of Uncle Billy wanting to meet the Pope.How does Ma keep Da in line, I wonder  “Oh that’s my secret,” laughs Olivia. “Da gives her a hard time, but, as in so many households, it all runs off Ma like water off a duck’s back.\u2028“You know I’ve a fabulous family, great friends and an acting career that allows me to do one of the most wonderful things, which is to make people laugh even in the midst of their own personal struggles and to be able to spread joy.“And to me the arts and comedy deserve more respect than they are often afforded, becauseyou can make people laugh together, that’s really overcoming ision.”‘IF I HAD A MAGIC WAND, I’D MAKE EDUCATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND INTEGRATED’Olivia, who calls Dame Judi Dench her ultimate acting inspiration, not only because of the incredible range that has allowed her to do everything from Shakespeare to the Bond franchise but also because she seems “so lovely” in interviews, recalls being repeatedly in trouble at school because she was simply born a very chatty and bubbly livewire.“I was at school in the days of the slap, as it were, and I had lots of them. I hold my hands up, I was always talking too much in class.”After joining Larne Drama Circle at  she was involved in so many dferent productions and drama festivals, appearing in comedies and plays like Brian Friel’s The Loves of Cass McGuire, Tea in a China Cup and even musicals. “Our church had a very strong music society and I cannot sing for peanuts. If I joined a choir, they would pay me to leave, probably. “But one year we did The Music Man I played Mrs Paroo. It was like speak-sing, you spoke it to the beat. We went to Waterford for the festival of light opera and I actually won a prize for best comedienne and to this day I can’t stop laughing about that or marvelling at how it actually came about. “The next year, we did Brigadoon, and I had a part as Meg Brockie, and one of her songs was My Mother’s Wedding Day, and I won a prize that year as well!”If Olivia had a magic wand and could change anything at all about Northern Ireland over night, she would like to see integrated education implemented here.“I remember growing up in Larne, being wheeled about with my friend in a buggy. She was a Protestant, and she was my best friend. Then, because I was a Catholic, she and I had to go to dferent schools when we got older, and I could never understand it.”Olivia added:“We should be together and everybody should be allowed to follow whatever religion they want to follow without it being a question of you being right and the other person being wrong, or anyone trying to impose their beliefs on anybody . “We need to have mutual respect for each other and I think integrated education is the way forward in trying to make that a reality.”See Give My Head Peace  on tour on March -, at the Market Place Theatre, Armagh March , at the Alley Theatre, Strabane March , at The McNeill Theatre, Larne March -, at the Riverside Theatre, Coleraine March , at the Strule Arts Centre, Omagh March -, at the Millennium Forum, Londonderry March , at the Theatre at the Mill, Newtownabbey March , at The Braid, Ballymena March -, at The Ardhowen Theatre, Enniskillen March -, at the Burnavon Theatre, Cookstown and March -April , at the Grand Opera House, Belfast.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The issue was raised in the council’s monthly meeting on Thursday, where Chief Executive Adrian McCreesh said the matter was drawn to his attention before it was due to take place.“The policy itself is very clear, in our view, that it extends only to the hire of facilities and the rooms therein,” he told councillors.“It is silent about outdoor and open recreational space as these areas are normally open to the public and open to public access and use, where bookings are not required.”The council had issued a statement in advance advising that anyone wishing to rearrange their booking for the observatory would be facilitated.The council advised the News Letter that the policy on using indoor council facilities for party political events had been subjected to a compulsory equality impact assessment. The chief executive had told councillors they may want to review it so that it might also apply outdoors, it added.

Mr Poots narrowly defeated Sir Jeffrey in the first ever DUP leadership contest in the party’s  year history. This had followed an internal party coup that ousted Arlen Foster as DUP leader and forced her out of the post as First Minister of Northern Ireland.Sir Jeffrey has repeated his claim this week that it was “nonsense” to report that he was about to defect to the UUP.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Here’s a list of all the key fees and charges set to rise at the start of the next financial year in April.Dedicated benches will increase from £ to £., and dedication trees will increase from £ to £.Beach hut booking fees will increase. During summer renting a large beach hut for a full day will go from £. to £., and for a half day from £. to £ while a small beach hut will increase from £ to £. for a full day and £. to £. for a half day. Annual passes for large huts will go from £ to £., and small huts from £ to £..Two excursion boats which stop at Penarth will have to pay much more to dock at Penarth Pier. The Waverly is an old paddle steamer, while the Balmoral is a pleasure steamer. Both boats currently pay £. in docking charges, but this will increase to £ on weekdays, £ on Saturdays and £ on Sundays.At Cosmeston Lakes, launching boats, riding horses, and orienteering will increase in price. Tours around the Mediaeval Village will also increase slightly in price. Horse riding and orienteering will also increase in price at Porthkerry Country Park. The price of getting married at all three venues remains the same at £,.Last year the Vale council controversially brought in new charges for cafes and restaurants to have outdoor tables and chairs. Their aim is to limit how much space some cafes take up on the pavement, “decluttering” town centres across the Vale, but businesses some objected to the fees. These fees, for ‘public furniture’, will not increase in April..removeCharges for bowling greens are no longer set by the council, as these were transferred over to bowling green clubs.Details of all the planned increases were revealed in a cabinet report. The council’s cabinet will meet on Monday, February , to sign off the budget proposals before they go to the full council for approval on March .The cabinet report said: “As public funding becomes increasingly constrained and under more intense scrutiny, greater emphasis has to be placed upon self-generated income and developing and presenting products and services that will resonate with paying customers.“As revenue budgets have reduced in recent years, income from fees and charges becomes ever more important as a way of sustaining priority services.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

RNLI Penarth reports that “everyone aboard was recovered safely but unfortunately the boat couldn’t be saved”.The volunteer crew alerted the public that the sinking boat was taken to Penarth beach for salvage to avoid it being lost at sea.The broken-up boat was cleared from Penarth beach on Sunday, February , with the RNLI working with HM Coastguard and Vale of Glamorgan Council to “resolve the situation” and advising people to stay clear while work was carried out due to potential hazards.“We’re pleased to say that the broken-up boat has now been cleared from Penarth beach,” reports RNLI Penarth.“Thank you to HM Coastguard and Vale of Glamorgan council for their great work making the beach safe again.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

One person, who had recently travelled home from northern Italy – at the time Europes epicentre of the pandemic – had tested positive for the new virus.The same day, the first death of a UK citizen was confirmed: a man who had become infected on a cruise ship holiday.It would be another three weeks before political leaders brought in sweeping lockdown restrictions, urging people to stay at home and making announcements about things like \"furlough\" – new and strange terminology that would soon become commonplace.The front page of the South Wales Argus on February , . The pandemic quickly introduced us to scientic advisers that would go on to become household names. During the UK Government press conferences, Boris Johnson would iniably be flanked by people like Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Chris Whitty.In Wales, chief medical officer Frank Atherton was thrust into the spotlight, offering advice on what we could do to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.At the time of the first case in Wales, Dr Atherton sought to reassure us in the face of this new threat.Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer of Wales. Picture: Huw Evans Picture Agency “All appropriate measures to provide care for the inidual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are bring taken,\" the Argus reported him as saying that day.\"I’d like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents,\" he added. \"Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public.\".removeStrict lockdown measures followed, and in the past two years we have spent months, in total, following stay-at-home rules and unable to meet others.That changed with the discovery and rollout of the ious Covid vaccines, and in Wales the jab rate became one of the best in the world after some initial delays.But coronavirus has taken a huge toll on society and has led to many people becoming ill and dying.Newport city centre during the coronavirus pandemic in . Picture: Huw Evans Picture Agency Here, Public Health Wales has recorded , Covid deaths and more than , positive cases since the pandemic began. Secondary impacts on healthcare have been profound: shutting down non-essential services during lockdown has meant demand for NHS services hit record levels, with more than , people on treamtent waiting lists in Wales.And there is growing recognition, too, of the other harms caused by restrictions, such as the impact isolation can have on peoples mental health.Presently, the situation in Wales is more settled, after the Omicron iant wave receded in the New Year. But the virus continues to do harm:  more Covid deaths were reported in Wales on Tuesday.The next Welsh Government Covid review will take place this Friday, and there are hopes the nations remaining Alert Level Zero restrictions can be scrapped by the end of March.A government survey last week found public attitudes to the pandemic are at their lowest point since the virus was first discovered here.Some  per cent of people think the pandemic poses a high or very high threat to the country, and just  per cent think it poses a high or very high threat to themselves.The economic effects of Covid continue, however. That same survey found around one in four people are concerned about paying their bills a month from now, meaning the pandemics wider impact on society is unlikely to go away any time soon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

At every moment the situation has to be very clear.“I know there’s a lot of space for improvement for this team and we have to try to be more stable. Tonight we showed that we have a lot of space for improvement in this aspect.”As much as the story will be about Tottenham’s exit, Middlesbrough were worthy winners and showed their elimination of Manchester United in the last round was no fluke.They were by far the better team and could have won in normal time but for a number of missed chances. vw,vw,px, px\"Chris Wilder, centre, celebrates the win with his players Something special could be brewing under Chris Wilder, who has already got Boro back in the Championship promotion mix, as they reached the last eight of the FA Cup for the first time since .Wilder said: “I am very proud of the performance of everybody, I thought the energy that the supporters gave the team was outstanding, it was my first experience of a packed Riverside and it was amazing.

But Chinese officials are dubious it is theirs.No matter whose it is, scientists expect the object to carve out a hole ft to ft across and send moon dust flying hundreds of miles across the barren, pockmarked surface. vw,vw,px, px\"A leftover rocket is expected to smash into the far side of the moon Low-orbiting space junk is relatively easy to track.Objects launching deeper into space are unlikely to hit anything and these far-flung pieces are usually soon forgotten, except by a handful of observers who enjoy playing celestial detective on the side.SpaceX originally took responsibility for the forthcoming lunar litter after asteroid tracker Bill Gray identied the collision course in January.He corrected himself a month later, saying the “mystery” object was not a SpaceX Falcon rocket upper stage from the  launch of a deep space climate observatory for Nasa.Mr Gray said it was likely to be the third stage of a Chinese rocket that sent a test sample capsule to the moon and back in .But Chinese officials said the upper stage had re-entered Earth’s atmosphere and burned up.But there were two Chinese missions with similar designations – the test flight and ′s lunar samplemission – and US observers believe the two are getting mixed up.The US Space Command, which tracks lower space junk, confirmed Tuesday that the Chinese upper stage from the  lunar mission never deorbited, as previously indicated in its database..removeBut it could not confirm the country of origin for the object about to strike the moon.“We focus on objects closer to the Earth,” a spokesman said in a statement.Jonathan McDowell of the Hard and Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics supports Mr Gray’s revised assessment, but notes: “The effect will be the same. It’ll leave yet another small crater on the moon.”The moon already bears countless craters but with little to no real atmosphere, the moon is defenceless against the constant barrage of meteors and asteroids, and the occasional incoming spacecraft, including a few intentionally crashed for science’s sake.With no weather, there is no erosion and so impact craters last forever.Tracking deep space mission leftovers like this is hard, said Mr McDowell.The moon’s gravity can alter an object’s path during flybys, creating uncertainty.And there is no readily available database, he said, aside from the ones “cobbled together” by himself, Mr Gray and a couple of others.“We are now in an era where many countries and private companies are putting stuff in deep space, so it’s time to start to keep track of it.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfcfbceebccbea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aedbdacebbba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfcfbceebccbea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aedbdacebbba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633286264647.jpg--economy_minister_hails_high_street_boost_as_shop_local_cards_are_used_3_7m_times.jpg?163328626600","title":"economy minister hails high street boost as shop local cards are used  m times ","story":"The High Street Scheme brought almost .million shoppers on to our high streets where they made over .million transactions, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons told the Assembly today as he published new data on the scheme. In a statement in the chamber, the Minister said the scheme injected at least pound.m into the economy, leading to an improved level of consumer confidence and increased levels of public spending. Today, the Department published a set of management information on the Scheme covering: number of residents issued with a cardnumber and percentage of cards activatedtotal spendnumber of transactions and spend by Local Government District andlocation and spend by postcode.The Minister said: “The High Street Scheme has been a huge success and achieved exactly what it set out to do. It brought shoppers back on to the High Street and has helped and supported our local retail, hospitality and service sectors start their journey of recovery from the devastating impact of the pandemic. “I am really pleased to announce that ,, people were issued with a Spend Local card, of which ,, – or .% – were activated. This is a tremendous achievement. The scheme was designed to provide an economic boost to the local economy and to this end pound.million has been injected into the economy. “This can be clearly seen from the fact that nearly .million customers visited our local shops, restaurants, bars, cafeacutes, cinemas, hairdressers across all parts of Northern Ireland during the letime of the Scheme and over .million new transactions were made using the Spend Local card. “Of course, we know that many of these customers will have spent more than the pound on their Spend Local card. So the figure – in real terms – will be greater.” The Minister told the Assembly that the early analysis showed the benefits of the Scheme were enjoyed in all parts of Northern Ireland. He said: “Over poundmillion was spent in Belfast, over poundmillion in Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon while over poundmillion was spent in each of the following local council areas – Newry, Mourne and Down Derry and Strabane Antrim and Newtownabbey Lisburn and Castlereagh and Ards and North Down. In Mid and East Antrim, the figure was over poundmillion. In Causeway Coast and Glens and in Mid Ulster, more than poundmillion was spent, while the figure for Fermanagh and Omagh was just over pound.million.” MLAs heard how the scale of the task of delivering the High Street Scheme was unprecedented as, in a matter of weeks, his Department implemented a process which manufactured, dispatched and delivered cards to close to .million people – each card unique to each applicant, including bespoke embossed cards for the visually impaired and blind. The Minister told MLAs: “The effort was worth it. I am sure that Members will have heard the same positive messages that I have heard from businesses, but it has also been confirmed by independent analysis.” According to an Ulster Bank Survey, retail sales in Northern Ireland rose in November  for the first time in four months. The banks Chief Economist Richard Ramsey said the High Street Scheme undoubtedly contributed to the pick-up in demand. Research in December  also showed an increase in shoppers on Northern Ireland’s high streets. The figures published by the Northern Ireland Retail Consortiumshowed a boost to the number of people going into shops or businesses in October continuing in November following the introduction of the High Street Scheme. In November, the number of shoppers in Northern Ireland reached their highest point so far compared to the pre-pandemic level. The Minister said: “The people from which I was most pleased to hear were the business owners who needed the scheme to help them cope with the impact of the pandemic. On a personal level, these iniduals – shopkeepers, barbers, newsagents, publicans, cafeacute owners, the list goes on – brought it home to me why this scheme was so important.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbabcabbbccd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eedbcee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
