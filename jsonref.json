I\u0027m not saying how I\u0027ve changed anymore. I\u0027m not saying what I\u0027ve done and what the new me is. I\u0027m not giving no more explanation. \u0027I\u0027ve done it several times, I\u0027ve talked about it. I am just done.\u0027   Later, he said it was \u0027your problem\u0027 if his apologies, which after he stepped down from the Oscars instead of saying sorry, were not accepted. Rose McGowan will plead no contest to a reduced drug charge...Share this article\u0027I\u0027m a good person. If you don\u0027t see that, it\u0027s a problem with you.  I shouldn\u0027t have to prove who I am, I shouldn\u0027t have to prove the levels of love that I am capable of giving. \u0027If anybody out there wants to think that Kevin Hart is such a monster that he wouldn\u0027t love someone because of their choice in life, then all power to \u0027em,\u0027 he said, giving his only promise throughout the interview that he was not  homophobic as accused. \u0027I am not over-delivering it, I am not overproving it because you find yourself in a position where it still won\u0027t be received and you go, What else do you want?                              I\u0027m a good person.

You want my arms?\u0027 he went on. He would not agree to do the Oscars again, he said, because there was now not enough time left for him to prepare. The Awards are being held on February 24, six weeks from now. \u0027I am not hosting the Oscars this year... right now, from a time perspective, I don\u0027t have the time. \u0027You\u0027re talking about two weeks that I would have to prepare,\u0027 he said.  \u0027I like to call myself a perfectionist. I would want to make sure the production is a great representation of me and my talent.   \u0027I can\u0027t do it this year, it\u0027s not going to happen, in the future if it does it does but it\u0027s not the conversation of today.\u0027 Hart said that the backlash Ellen DeGeneres received for supporting him proved that there was \u0027no ending\u0027. \u0027If you keep feeding this energy, then it\u0027s going to grow,\u0027 he said.            Unamused: Hart was stern as he repeatedly told host Michael Strahan that he would not apologize again for his remarks or explain how he had changed On Tuesday, Hart said the chances of him taking the gig were \u0027very slim\u0027 as he was confronted by photographers while promoting his new film, The Upside, but teased that an announcement may be imminent. \u0027I\u0027m not gonna say anything, and I\u0027m definitely got gonna say it here, but the chances are very slim,\u0027 he said, adding: \u0027I love the Academy, I love everybody that\u0027s involved with the process of building the Oscars and making it. \u0027This year was just a tricky year, so maybe in the future it\u0027ll work out.\u0027   Hart was named as the host of the 91st Academy Awards in December. He took proudly to social media afterwards to announce it but his elation was short-lived. Within days, Twitter users had unearthed his old tweets and demanded that he be removed. Among them were posts where he labeled people \u0027f**gs\u0027 and jokes about what he would do if his son came out as gay. Despite the backlash, Hart refused to apologize and instead quit over the controversy, blindsiding the Academy and leaving them without a host. He said the Oscars gave him an ultimatum apologize or give up the gig. He chose the latter.            Harts homophobic tweets from 2009 - 2011 resurfaced last month after he was given the gig. He deleted them years ago           Hart later appeared on Ellen where she defended him and called for him to get the job back. Her comments enraged the LGBTQ community In Instagram posts afterwards, he said he had already addressed the tweets in the past and refused to e back into the discussion, saying instead that it would only seek to \u0027feed the trolls\u0027. Later, he appeared on Ellen where both he and she called for viewers to embrace growth and change. During their interview, she revealed that she had even called the Academy to ask if Hart could still host the show and said she was told he could. Ellen, who has long been an icon in the LGBTQ community, was lampooned for throwing her support behind the comedian afterwards. Hart later came to her defense, saying: \u0027When did we get to the point where we forgot that we all learn, then we all have the ability to grow and with that growth comes a wealth of knowledge.\u0027You can’t change without a understanding of what GROWTH means.\u0027 On Tuesday, he made a frustrated apology on his radio show where he said: \u0027Once again, Kevin Hart apologizes for his remarks that hurt members of the LGBTQ community.\u0027I apologize. I am now moving on from this because I\u0027m just hoping that the apology is accepted.\u0027 A replacement is yet to be named for the February 24 awards show. Among the possibilities organizers were pondering was to go \u0027SNL-style\u0027 with a rotation of presenters. Good Morning America on Twitter: \u0026quotTHIS MORNING: @KevinHart4real joins us LIVE in Times Square.¿ \u0026quot"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Harrys 2 5m Cotswolds love nest owned David Camerons property tycoon pal","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan’s Cotswolds country hideaway is owned by a millionaire pal of David Cameron, who stands accused of letting his own Georgian mansion fall into disrepair          An aerial shot of the country home, where the couple have hosted several A-list friends, including the likes of George and Amal Clooney and Serena Williams          An aerial shot of the rural idyll that Harry and Meghan have chosen as their secluded country home  The £2.5million four-bedroom farmhouse, nestled deep in the Oxfordshire countryside, was leased to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex last year by  businessman Nicholas Johnston Four bedrooms, two kitchens, outdoor dining area and a staff...Share this articleAs well as their celebrity friends, Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland has also visited the farmhouse, which dates back to the 18th century and comes with four bedrooms.It is preferred by the couple to Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace, where they currently reside when in London.Harry and Meghan acquired a two-year lease in May last year and moved in before their wedding.

I think the electoral law is so vague I really can\u0027t be sure. The one thing I do know, I was not responsible for any of those expenses.\u0027In an official statement, Mr Mackinlay said: \u0027I await a statement from the Electoral Commission, the CPS and Kent Police as to how they justify millions of pounds of taxpayers\u0027 money in pursuing me in a political show trial.\u0027He also called for an urgent clarification of election law, but raised concerns over whether the Electoral Commission is \u0027fit for purpose\u0027 to help with the task.\u0027I now have extreme concerns as to the clarity of election law, and the glaring grey area between national spending rules (under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000) and local spending rules (under the Representation of the People Act 1983),\u0027 he said.\u0027Candidates and Agents should never have to face the threat of criminal prosecution, with life-changing consequences, in the face of abstract law.\u0027A Conservative Party spokesman said: \u0027We welcome that Craig Mackinlay MP and his election agent have been cleared of any wrongdoing by the court.\u0027This case has highlighted just how unclear and fragmented electoral law was in 2015.\u0027We are disappointed with the verdicts in relation to Marion Little. It was only in 2018, three years after the event, that the Supreme Court concluded an interpretation of the election law in question, overturning a unanimous ruling from the Court of Appeal, presided over by the Lord Chief Justice, that warned of \u0027wide ranging unintended consequences... in terms of criminality\u0027 of taking forward such an interpretation of the law.\u0027The Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which was passed by a Labour Government, provided a distinction between candidate-focused spending and party-focused spending.\u0027However, given recent court interpretations, there is clearly a need for greater clarity and guidance on the law. We will take further legal advice and continue to meet with the Electoral Commission to seek this.\u0027After the case, Mr Farage said: \u0027This verdict shows that there are no election rules for the big parties in British politics, they can wilfully overspend without any consequences.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman drags tiny dog named zebra riding electric scooter","story":"    A home surveillance camera in Bakersfield, California, captured a woman dragging a small dog behind her rental scooter on Sunday           An eyewitness reported seeing the pet being dragged along the road on its side at about 15mph for at least 100 yards   The unnamed suspect is seen wearing wireless headphones while riding the Bird scooter with the tiny dog in tow       Something to smile about?

From the wife that defied...The captivating foreign socialite who helped Nixon win the...Share this articleMy solution was to become a Norwich street poet. I would approach the good citizens of Norfolk and offer to recite any poem from memory.To start with, I began cramming at the rate of a poem a day, aiming for 30 poems. After a month or so I had my 30, plus a dozen more.It was not an enormous number, but I’d selected a repertoire spread carefully over all periods and styles, so that if I couldn’t produce an inidual poem, I could find a work-around: ‘I’m sorry, I don’t know that particular poem by Betjeman, but here’s another one you might like . . .’Despite the hostility, snubs and brush-offs — some abusive — I received, around one in ten attempts resulted in a poem and payment.After a few days on the streets I found I was making around £12 an hour. Poetry, it seemed, was very important to people — even in the social media-obsessed 21st century, and they were actually prepared to pay for it.(Young people, I found, are also generally more receptive to poetry than older people. In fact, they are generally nicer and more polite than older people, full stop. Unfortunately, they are also poorer.)What would happen next taught me a lesson: something seems to have gone wrong with modern poetry. The poems that people ask for are rhyming poems, many of them 100 or more years old.During the year I went on to spend on the streets, I was able to gain a pretty reasonable idea of people’s favourite poems — the ones I recited over and over again. Here are five of the most beloved from my eventual list of 150.If — by Rudyard Kipling  Rudyard Kipling (pictured above) had penned the poem \u0027If\u0027If you can keep your head when all about youAre losing theirs and blaming it on you,If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,But make allowance for their doubting tooIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:If you can dream — and not make dreams your masterIf you can think — and not make thoughts your aimIf you can meet with Triumph and DisasterAnd treat those two impostors just the sameIf you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spokenTwisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:If you can make one heap of all your winningsAnd risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginningsAnd never breathe a word about your lossIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinewTo serve your turn long after they are gone,And so hold on when there is nothing in youExcept the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,Or walk with Kings — nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,If all men count with you, but none too muchIf you can fill the unforgiving minuteWith sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,And — which is more — you’ll be a Man, my son!This poem, which first appeared in a 1910 collection of Kipling’s verse, is the public’s favourite poem. It is couched as advice to ‘my son’ — presumably his only son, John.          Rudyard Kipling (pictured above) was a writer and Nobel LaureateA sad tale attaches to John. He was rejected as unfit during World War I. Kipling however, an ardent patriot, pulled strings to get John enlisted. The young man died at the Battle of Loos. But his son’s spirit and bravery continues to live on in the poem that has inspired millions.There is something about this particular poem that simply mesmerises people. They are transfixed, absorbed, transported, elevated. Kipling’s masterpiece is just right — not too long, not too short.And listeners, even if they can recall its actual words only dimly, have a real sense of its shape, the inevitability towards its magnificent ending.Sometimes I stop before those last six words and point to the person who has requested the poem. ‘You’ll be a man, my son,’ they say.They knew a thing or two, those Victorians. This poem deals with questions relevant to any age. And, unbelievably, the questions are not only asked, but answered in the space of four stanzas.Someone born in 1865 is able to speak to us right now and tell us exactly how to behave. No wonder tears come to people’s eyes.Invictus: The Unconquerable — by W.E. Henley          The poem Invictus: The Unconquerable, by W.E. Henley is said to have inspired Nelson Mandela (pictured above)Out of the night that covers me,Black as the pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may beFor my unconquerable soul.In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chanceMy head is bloody, but unbowed.Beyond this place of wrath and tearsLooms but the Horror of the shade,And yet the menace of the yearsFinds, and shall find, me unafraid.It matters not how strait the gate,How charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.How this poem came to be written a tale worth telling. Henley had suffered from tuberculosis of the bone since childhood, and aged around 20 was forced to have his leg amputated below the knee.Later he developed an infection in the other leg and was told that this too, would have to come off. Henley sought a second opinion from the celebrated surgeon and antiseptic pioneer Joseph Lister, who operated to save the second leg.It was during these gruelling medical trials that Henley wrote his poem. Despite the horrors that await him, we learn, he is entirely unafraid.The doctors could whittle him down limb by limb and his soul would be untouched.No wonder this poem inspired Nelson Mandela in his prison on Robben Island, or that we now have the Invictus Games for injured service personnel.And so to Norwich city centre, where there are two girls aged about 16, with sad faces. The first asks for Invictus. ‘Very well,’ I say to them.‘But I need to go into Primark,’ says the second.‘No problem. I’ll go with you,’ I say.We walk into the shop, and I begin reciting as the girls stop by a display of plastic jewellery:‘Out of the night that covers me‘Black as the pit from pole to pole . . .’They are looking at the jewellery but also listening, especially the first. Despite her youth, it seems as if she might know something about ‘the pit’.By the end of the second quatrain the recitation has attracted the attention of a man in a shirt and tie who asks me to leave. ‘Just a minute,’ I say. ‘It’s nearly over.’‘I said outside.’ Suddenly I feel furious. The brave and fearless W.E. Henley would not have let himself be marched out of Primark. I’m damned if Henley is going to be stopped. I continue. ‘OK, Paul,’ the man says into his radio to an unknown person.‘He’s only reciting a poem,’ says the second girl, surprising me with her support.I finish, bow and walk off quickly, my hands up. As I near the exit, a second security guard is running towards me.I reach the door. ‘I’m going!’ I call out as I disappear into the street.Macavity The Mystery Cat — by T.S. Eliot          T.S Elliot (pictured above) penned the famous poem \u0027Macavity The Mystery Cat\u0027Macavity’s a Mystery Cat: he’s called the Hidden Paw —For he’s the master criminal who can defy the Law.He’s the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad’s despair:For when they reach the scene of crime — Macavity’s not there!Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,He’s broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,And when you reach the scene of crime — Macavity’s not there!You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air —But I tell you once and once again, Macavity’s not there!Macavity’s a ginger cat, he’s very tall and thinYou would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domedHis coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snakeAnd when you think he’s half asleep, he’s always wide awake.Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,For he’s a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square –But when a crime’s discovered, then Macavity’s not there!He’s outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard’s.And when the larder’s looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke’s been stifled,Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair —Ay, there’s the wonder of the thing! Macavity’s not there!And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty’s gone astray,Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair —But it’s useless to investigate —Macavity’s not there!And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:‘It must have been Macavity!’ — but he’s a mile away.You’ll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs,Or engaged in doing complicated long ision sums.Macavity, Macavity, there’s no one like Macavity,There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare:At whatever time the deed took place — MACAVITY WASN’T THERE!And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known,(I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the timeJust controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime.          Thomas Stearns Eliot (pictured above) was a Poet And CriticOn a mild autumn evening, I was ambling past a restaurant. Outside it, a tall, sandy-haired man and two smart young boys were getting into a Rolls-Royce. ‘Good evening,’ I said to the man. ‘I don’t know if you’d be interested, but I’m a poetry performer. If you have a poem you like, I’ll try to recite it for you.’ The man looked at me with a certain degree of amusement. ‘I see,’ he said.‘And if you enjoy it, and only if, I offer my hat for any contribution you might care to make.’‘A poem I like?’ he said. ‘How about Macavity The Mystery Cat?’‘With pleasure.’‘Boys!’ he called into the car. ‘Come out! I want you to listen to this.’The boys, about eight and 10, clambered out of the car and stood obediently on the pavement.‘Macavity’s a Mystery Cat,’ I began quietly, looking into their eyes.T. S. Eliot wrote Macavity for his own godchildren it was later included in the 1939 collection Old Possum’s Book Of Practical Cats, which would later find immortality in the long-running stage musical Cats.I finished, and bowed. The owner of the Rolls-Royce took out his wallet, but then stopped. ‘Do you think you could do one more?’ he asked.In the front passenger seat of the car was an old woman. The man opened the driver’s side door and bent down.‘Mum,’ he said. ‘There’s a man here who can recite poems. Would you like to hear a poem?’The woman didn’t say anything.‘It’s OK,’ the man said. ‘Get in, you can sit next to her. I’ll go round and sit in the back.’Getting in, I closed the door behind me. The Rolls was very spacious, like a first-class seat on a train. The woman was frail, 85 years old, perhaps.‘Pleased to meet you,’ I said to the woman. She neither turned nor looked at me. The man spoke from behind her.‘We’re going to hear a poem,’ he said to her.She moved her head fractionally.‘It can be any poem you like,’ I said to her.Dead silence.‘It could be something you remember from school . . .’No response.‘I’ll try and remember it for you, and then I can recite . . .’‘Knocking on the moonlit door,’ she said, cutting me off.The relief was profound.‘Oh, that’s one of my favourites,’ I said. I wasn’t lying. She was referring to The Listeners by Walter de la Mare, written in about 1912. ‘Would you like to hear it?’No reply.‘I’ll try,’ I said. ‘And if you don’t like it, you can stop me. OK?’No reply.‘Is there anybody there . . .’ I began.But I had only got to ‘there’ when the woman turned to me, saying: ‘. . . said the Traveller’.Her grey eyes were unclouded, and as she spoke the words I could almost sense her falling back through decades.I waited for her to go on. She didn’t, so I continued. ‘Knocking on the moonlit door. And his horse in the silence champed the grasses of the forest’s ferny floor,’ I said.‘Floor,’ she echoed.As I went on, the woman’s lips moved a little, and there seemed to be a shadow of a smile on her face. The car was no longer a car. It was a clearing in a dark forest. I finished, and inclined my head in a brief bow. Then the woman did something unexpected. She reached for my hand. I held it. Her eyelids fluttered weakly. ‘Thank you,’ the man said, finally.‘Thank you for listening,’ I said to the woman. She let go of my hand.I got out of the car. The man got out too, and came over. He extracted a £50 note from his wallet, huge and red in the light from the restaurant window.‘That was wonderful,’ he said.‘Thank you,’ I replied, accepting the note with some disbelief. ‘That’s very generous. I promise to spend it wisely.’‘Spend it however you like,’ he said, putting his wallet away in his back pocket. ‘You’ve earned it.’He Wishes For The Cloths of Heaven — by W.B. YeatsHad I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,Enwrought with golden and silver light,The blue and the dim and the dark clothsOf night and light and the half-light,I would spread the cloths under your feet:But I, being poor, have only my dreamsI have spread my dreams under your feetTread softly because you tread on my dreams.Yeats is thought to have drawn on his own experience of courting the beautiful Anglo-Irish actress Maud Gonne, who refused several offers of marriage from him.          Yeats is thought to have drawn on his own experience of courting the beautiful Anglo-Irish actress Maud Gonne (pictured above)He never did manage to persuade her to become his wife.When I first went out on the street, I didn’t know this poem. But then I had a rather spiky response from a woman who had requested it. ‘Well, you’d better go off and learn it, then, hadn’t you?’ she said, making a little shooing gesture with her hand.So I learned it, and found it came in very handy. Lots of people asked for it, and it was always very well received.But I often wished I could meet the spiky woman again.There had been something unkind about the way she had dismissed me, something schoolmistressy she had really seemed to take pleasure in telling me what to do and where to go.I wanted another chance. But of course, life doesn’t work out like that.Except that sometimes it does. Months later, I did meet her again. She was with a group of about a dozen people walking through the city centre at around midnight one weekend.  William Butler Yeats (left and right) was a Irish poet and playwright‘Oh, the little poetry man,’ she said, recognising me. (I’m 5ft 11in.)Since meeting her I had had hundreds, thousands of encounters, but I knew her straight away: tall, slender, long blonde hair, handsome, but also a little lost-looking.‘How about some Yeats?’ I asked, joining the group and falling into step with her.          William Butler Yeats (pictured above) was also a prose writer‘You learned it for me? You remember me?’ she said, her eyes lighting up. I am afraid a demon entered me. I wanted to pay her back for her unkindness. I couldn’t be generous. ‘No,’ I said.The light died from her eyes. ‘Oh . . .’‘Yes, all right,’ I said, trying to make amends. ‘I do recognise you. I learned it for you. Do you want to hear it?’‘If you like.’ I recited it.One of her friends shouted as I finished: ‘That was very good!’ But she said nothing. She walked on, ignoring me.I had hurt her. The whole world felt sad.Pied Beauty — by Gerard Manley Hopkins          Gerard Manley Hopkins (pictured above) wrote the \u0027Pied Beauty\u0027 poemGlory be to God for dappled things —For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cowFor rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swimFresh-firecoal chestnut-falls finches’ wingsLandscape plotted and pieced — fold, fallow, and ploughAnd áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.All things counter, original, spare, strangeWhatever is fickle, freckled, (who knows how?)With swift, slow sweet, sour adazzle, dimHe fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:Praise him.The birthday party was in summertime: there was a big tent in the garden, and children were running around squealing excitedly in grass-stained clothing.The birthday girl was 30, and had invited her friends — artists, mainly — to celebrate with her.I had been hired for the day to mingle among the guests and recite poetry.They were a knowledgeable audience — no one said (as they so often did out on the streets: ‘I hate poetry,’ ‘Get a job,’ ‘I don’t carry change,’ ‘Do I look like I know anything about poetry?’, ‘Not interested,’ or ‘Spit some grime.’I struck up a conversation with a gentleman standing under a tree and nursing a glass of champagne. He said he was a lecturer in English And American Studies at the University of Sussex, and I vaguely recognised him.          During his time reciting poetry Gary Dexter struck up a conversation with a man who worked at the University of Sussex (pictured above)I told him I had been engaged by the hostess to recite poems, and he regarded me with scepticism.‘Which poems?’ he asked.‘Any poems you like,’ I replied.‘You can recite any poem I mention?’‘Yes,’ I said. Of course, it was untrue. English poetry is infinite.‘Julia,’ he said. ‘Come and listen to this.’ Julia came over with a friend. They were both very nice middle-class ladies. ‘This man’s going to recite a poem for us,’ said the lecturer. ‘Whatever we choose.’          Gerard Manley Hopkins (was an English poet)‘Oh, wooonderful,’ said one. ‘I love poetry. Can we have Marvell?’‘No,’ said the lecturer. ‘I’m choosing the poem. You can have Marvell later.’‘If you want to hear some Marvell, I’d be happy to . . .’ I said.But the lecturer cut me short. ‘What I want you to recite,’ he pronounced slowly, ‘is Pied Beauty by Gerard Manley Hopkins.’‘Very well,’ I said. I paused, then began:‘Glory be to God for dappled things . . .’I had practised the poem many, many times, and for good reason: Hopkins’s poetry is difficult, and requires plenty of concentration and dedication.This particular one, for example, written in 1877, is a ‘curtal sonnet’ — an invention of Hopkins, involving only ten-and-a-half lines, as opposed to the conventional 14.A challenge, certainly.I finished, and bowed, as I always did. The lecturer in English And American Studies turned to me.‘That,’ he said, ‘was the second-best rendition of that poem I have ever heard.’A remark I have been wondering about ever since. Gary Dexter\u0027s health improved and he has returned to his work as a writer and musician, and now a reciter of poetry.Adapeted from The People’s Favourite Poems by Gary Dexter (Old Street, £12.99). © Gary Dexter 2019.

It used to happen a lot then. \u0027I remember a red car pulling into a long lay-by just ahead of me and it made me nervous. \u0027The driver was a horrible, dark haired, sleazy guy who had the windows down and as I pulled level asked me how old I was and where I was going and said he would give me a lift.

He was obviously really angry and he spun his wheels and yanked the steering wheel round.‘I told my parents about him. Later, when we saw the coverage of the Milly Dowler case, I felt physically sick because I thought about what had happened and that it could have been me too. \u0027The picture of Bellfield was definitely the same guy and there was no doubt in my mind it was the same vehicle.’Miss Harvey, now married with a young family, added: ‘Even now, watching the programme, it has made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end thinking about what if. And I wonder if I had reported it whether things might have been different.’          The ITV drama Manhunt re-tells the events leading up to the serial killer\u0027s arrest and stars Martin Clunes as detective Colin Sutton, who has inspired other women to come forwardManhunt revealed how Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton, played by Men Behaving Badly star Clunes, was called in to investigate the August 2004 murder of Amelie Delagrange in Twickenham.He realised the crime was linked to several others in the west LondonSurrey area: Milly’s abduction and murder in Walton-on-Thames in March 2002, the murder of Marsha McDonnell in Hampton in February 2003 and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, who was deliberately run over by a van in Isleworth in May 2004.Bellfield was convicted in 2008 of the murders of Miss McDonnell, 19, and Miss Delagrange, 22, and the attempted murder of Miss Sheedy, 18. In 2011, he was found guilty of the abduction and murder of Milly Dowler.

The statement did not mention how the two will split that fortune, though experts believed that\u0027s already been hashed out.Much of that dollar amount comes from his 16 percent ownership stake in Amazon, which briefly became the second US-based company to reach a $1 trillion valuation in September, behind Apple in August.  Amazon\u0027s stock edged up $2.84 on Wednesday to close at $1,659.42. That left Amazon with a market value of $811 billion, more than any other publicly traded company in the US. The company passed Microsoft this week to become the world\u0027s biggest publicly traded company by market capitalization.The orce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Thomas Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson \u0026amp Co.Amazon Vice President of Corporate Communications Drew Herdener told DailyMail.com in a statement: \u0027Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon.\u0027Two-time author MacKenzie Bezos, 48, who won an American Book Award in 2006, was one of the first employees of Amazon at its founding, doing accounting for the start-up.

She was one of the first employees of Amazon at its founding, doing accounting for the start-up          Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos married in 1993, one year before he founded Amazon, which he started from a garage in Seattle in 1994. Jeff is pictured with stacks of books in 1997The two, who both graduated from Princeton University six years apart, live in Washington, which is a community property state, and that means all assets acquired during the marriage by either spouse are split equally unless there\u0027s a prenuptial agreement stating otherwise.The ision of the Bezos\u0027 assets will be complicated because the two will continue to pursue joint ventures, according to the joint statement.  \u0027We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other,\u0027 the statement read.  \u0027We\u0027ve had such a great life together as a married couple, and we also see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as iniduals pursuing ventures and adventures.\u0027Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends.\u0027 Toby Yerburgh, Partner and Head of Family at Collyer Bristow LLP, told DailyMail.com: \u0027Not since the \u0027conscious uncoupling\u0027 statement of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin have a high profile couple released such a positive and upbeat statement announcing their orce as the one released today by Jeff Bezos and his wife. \u0027Such agreed statements often form part of the negotiations over a financial split and come attached to an NDA. They demonstrate the importance of high profile orcing couples\u0027 lawyers working hand in glove with their PR agents.\u0027          Jeff Bezos is worth close to $140 billion. The statement did not mention how the two will split that fortune.

Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.\u0027They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the orce.\u0027Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff  to buy out his wife or for MacKenzie  to retain shares.\u0027If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,\u0027 she said.It is unlikely that many details of the orce will become public, New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who is representing Judith Giuliani in her orce from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said.\u0027These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,\u0027 Clair said.

Her father was a financial planner father and she had a stay-at-home mom.By high school, she had moved east, and graduated from Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1988. MacKenzie went on to graduate from Princeton University with a bachelor\u0027s degree in English, with highest honors in 1992.She studied under Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison while in college, who said she was \u0027one of the best students I\u0027ve ever had in my creative writing classes.\u0027Morrison, who was MacKenzie\u0027s thesis adviser, was the one who connected her with famed literary agent Amanda \u0027Binky\u0027 Urban. Jeff also graduated from Princeton, but in 1986, and the two never crossed paths while studying there. Jeff and MacKenzie met at work in New York City in 1992. Jeff was the first to interview MacKenzie at the  investment management firm of DE Shaw. At the time, Jeff was a vice president there, and MacKenzie had come on board as a research associate, Business Insider reported.The two Princeton graduates were engaged three months later and married in 1993. Transformation: When Bezos\u0027 net worth reached $105.1 billion in January of 2018, CNN reported that he was the richest person in history. Jeff is shown at left during a press conference on August 23, 2000, and at right during the Allen \u0026amp Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 13, 2017That was all before Jeff founded Amazon, which he started from a garage in Seattle in 1994. Since that time, the two have made a noticeable style transformation.Portraits of the Amazon CEO that were taken in 1997 — the year his company went public — show him wearing a blue button-down shirt, pleated khaki pants, and a black leather wrist watch while posing next to stacks of books. Fast forward to 2017, and Jeff set the internet alight when he showed up to the annual Allen \u0026amp Company Sun Valley conference with bulging muscles peeking out from his polo shirt.With his shaved head and tinted sunglasses — plus the bulging biceps — many on Twitter couldn\u0027t help but compare the Amazon CEO to action star Vin Diesel.Gone were Jeff\u0027s baggy shirts and receding hairline and there, among the richest and most influential people in the world, he seemed to emerge reborn.MacKenzie, meanwhile, went from frumpy separates to sleek, form-fitting sheath dresses that she often accessorizes with a pair of classic pumps. The two were most-recently seen attending Senator John McCain\u0027s funeral in early September. Jeff was wearing a classic black suit with a blue tie, while MacKenzie wore a long-sleeve black sheath and matching heels.           Jeff and MacKenzie were most-recently seen attending Senator John McCain\u0027s funeral in early September in Washington, DC. Jeff was wearing a classic black suit with a blue tie, while MacKenzie wore a long-sleeve black sheath and matching heelsSpeaking of their early years at an event in Berlin in April, Jeff said MacKenzie\u0027s support was instrumental when he founded Amazon, and that she did the accounting for the company in its first year.\u0027When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,\u0027 he said at the event.Now, if the two file for orce in their home state of Washington, their assets may be subject to the community property state\u0027s laws of ision.In Washington, all income earned and property acquired by either spouse during a marriage is owned by both spouses, together, and will be split equally upon orce, unless that default rule is opted out of with a prenuptial agreement.  But since the duo\u0027s fortune was amassed after they met, it\u0027s highly likely they didn\u0027t draft a pre-nup before they wed.  Jeff\u0027s wealth has grown exponentially in the last five years, with Forbes estimating his net worth at $32 billion in March of 2014. When his net worth reached $105.1 billion in January of 2018, CNN reported that Jeff was the richest person in history. Now, he\u0027s worth $136.9 billion, and he and MacKenzie are thought to own more land, together, than almost anyone else in the United States of America, according to Business Insider. If his $137 billion fortune is split equally with MacKenzie, it would mean Jeff would lose the title as world\u0027s richest person, and MacKenzie would gain the title of world\u0027s richest woman.But even with a $69 billion fortune, the Amazon founder would still be ranked fifth richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. The two, who have been known to live relatively modestly despite the monumental wealth they\u0027ve acquired in recent years, reportedly lived in a one-bedroom rented home in Seattle through 1999. To date, they now own at least five homes throughout the country.          Community property is the default rule in Washington, which means all assets acquired by either spouse during a marriage are split equally in orce, but that can be opted out of with a prenuptial agreement. Jeff and MacKenzie own two homes in Medina, an exclusive Seattle suburb, an aerial view of which is shown. They paid $10 million for the property in 1998On the west coast, they own two homes in Medina, Washington, an exclusive Seattle suburb that is also home to Bill Gates.They paid $10 million for 5.3 acres of property in 1998, according to the Wall Street Journal.One of the homes covers 20,600 square feet with five bedrooms and five bathrooms. The other is 8,300 square feet with five bedrooms and five bathrooms. The latter is rumored to have cost $53 million.The estate with 310 feet of Lake Washington shoreline underwent a $28 million renovation in 2010.          Bezos\u0027 beautiful original Mediterranean-style home (pictured), located on North Alpine Drive, was purchased back in 2007 for $24.45 million          Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos broadened his Beverly Hills abode by acquiring a neighbor\u0027s off-market property for $12.9 million          This aerial shot shows the entire Bezos compound in a ritzy neighborhood of Beverly Hills          To date, the two own five homes throughout the country, including this second house shown in Beverly Hills which was acquired off-market from a neighbor for $12.9 millionIn Beverly Hills, the two added on to an original purchase in Southern California from 2007 that cost them $24.45 million by buying an adjacent home in an off-market sale from a neighbor for $12.9 million in 2017. The first home is a seven-bed, seven-bath Spanish-style mansion with a greenhouse, tennis court, swimming pool, six car garage and four fountains.Neighbors reportedly include A-listers Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Walter Matthau.The second home is far more modest at just 4,568 square feet with four bedrooms.          The majority of the duo\u0027s land holdings are in West Texas, where the family owns an estimated 400,000 acres in Culberson and Hudspeth counties east of El Paso. One of the holdings is a 30,000-acre Figure 2 ranch outside of Van Horn (pictured in an aerial view)           Figure 2 is also the home base of Jeff Bezos\u0027 space exploration company Blue Origin, which was incorporated in 2001The majority of Jeff and MacKenzie\u0027s land holdings are in West Texas, where the clan owns an estimated 400,000 acres in Culberson and Hudspeth counties, east of El Paso.Most of the Texas land was purchased using limited-liability companies named for famous explorers, according to the Wall Street Journal.It includes the family\u0027s 30,000-acre Figure 2 ranch outside of Van Horn, which serves as a reminder of the summers Jeff spent on his grandparents\u0027 ranch growing up.Figure 2 serves as the home base for Jeff\u0027s private space company Blue Origin, which was founded in 2001.A portion of the duo\u0027s net worth comes from Blue Origin, which is valued at somewhere between $1 billion and $28 billion.It is difficult to determine the specific value of the company because of the lack of details available about the enterprise, and the fact that Jeff is the sole shareholder, Chad Anderson, CEO of venture fund Space Angels, told Bloomberg.Jeff said in April 2017 that he funds Blue Origin through the sale of \u0027about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock\u0027.          The Bezos paid $23 million for the former Textile Museum in Kalorama, Washington, DC in 2016          The space was built in 1912 and occupies a spot on the National Register of Historic PlacesOn the east coast, Jeff and MacKenzie own property in Washington, DC, as well.In 2016 the Bezos dropped $23 million on a former textile museum in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, DC.The 27,000 square foot space was built in 1912 and occupies a spot on the National Register of Historic Places.Kalorma is known to be an enclave for Washington power-players including the Obamas, who own a $5.3 million home nearby, as do Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.Jeff\u0027s other big investment in the capital is The Washington Post, which he purchased in August 2013 for $250million. The paper is included in his estimated net worth.          The two bought three condos in the Century building at 25 Central Park West (pictured) in New York City\u0027s Upper West Side in 1999 under an LLC called \u0027Jetima\u0027          The purchase of the New York City home in the building pictured was from former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola for $7.65 millionAnd in Manhattan, the two bought three condos in the Century building at 25 Central Park West in New York City\u0027s Upper West Side in 1999 under an LLC called \u0027Jetima.\u0027 The purchase was from former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola for $7.65 million. Jeff and MacKenzie share four children, including three sons and a daughter, who they adopted from China.  Their oldest child, Preston, turned 18 in March.MacKenzie is the author of \u0027The Testing of Luther Albright,\u0027 a psychological novel about the challenges facing a Sacramento, California father and his family after an earthquake, which won her the American Book Award in 2006.In 2014 she launched Bystander Revolution, an anti-bullying organization.In September, Jeff committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities.

It found 39 per cent of pupils in selective school areas progress from state schools to highly-selective universities, compared to just 23 per cent in comprehensive areas.And a state school pupil from the most disadvantaged fifth of the population is more than twice as likely to progress to Oxbridge if they live in a selective area. An ethnic minority state school pupil is more than five times as likely to get into Oxbridge if they live in a selective area.          They are especially instrumental in helping ethnic minority children, with England’s 163 grammars sending more of them to Cambridge (pictured) than all 1,849 non-selective schools combinedThe analysis takes into account both the chances of children from different groups getting into a grammar school and how children who do get in perform. Anti-grammar campaigners have previously latched on to the fact that only 2.5 per cent of grammar school pupils are entitled to free school meals, compared with 13.2 per cent in state-funded secondary schools.But this measure of disadvantage obscures large differences within the remaining 85 per cent of the population.

Instead, Rob Lower performed what was labeled a \u0027disastrous\u0027 performance with Snow White during the 61st Academy Awards.This year\u0027s show is expected to \u0027play up a high-profile year for music in film, thanks to likely nominees Lady Gaga, Dolly Parton, and Kendrick Lamar,\u0027 sources tell Variety. Hart confirmed that he would not host the Oscars during an unapologetic interview on Wednesday morning where he said he was \u0027over\u0027 discussing his homophobic tweet and had \u0027nothing to prove\u0027 to anyone. The comedian appeared on Good Morning America where he repeatedly said he would no longer \u0027give energy\u0027 to the controversy which led to him stepping down as the host of next month\u0027s 91st Academy Awards. Stone-faced, he said: \u0027I am done with it. It gets no more energy. \u0027For the last time, I am done addressing this. There is no more conversation about it. \u0027I\u0027m done with it, I am over it.\u0027  Asked how he had evolved since his 2009-2010 tweets about \u0027f*gs\u0027 and disowning his son if he ever came out as gay, Hart would not be drawn. \u0027I have explained how I evolved.

With the publication of her second YA novel coming up next month, here’s your chanceAngie Thomas is the author of the bestseller The Hate U Give, a novel for young adults that was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and which tells the story of Starr Carter, a 16-year-old African American girl who is drawn to activism after witnessing the police shooting of a childhood friend. Published in 2017, the book has been on the New York Times young adult bestseller list for 96 weeks and has won many awards, including children’s book of the year at the British book awards, and the Waterstones children’s book prize for 2018. Writer Nikesh Shukla described it as “one of the most important books of 2017” and it has also recently been made into a successful film.Thomas grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and she was the first black student to graduate in creative writing from the city’s Belhaven University. Her second book On the Come Up, published in February, is a love letter to hip-hop and tells the story of Bri, a teenager who dreams of becoming the greatest rapper of all time. Thomas was a rapper as a teenager.We are offering readers the chance to put a question to the award-winning author: submit them in the comments section below, email us at review@observer, or tweet @ObsNewReview by 10am on Monday 14 January. Here are some Angie Thomas quotes to inspire you...“I grew up in a neighbourhood called Georgetown, which is the ’hood...I would hear gunshots at night… but one thing I did love about my neighbourhood growing up was the sense of community.”“When I couldn’t find myself in books, I found myself in the rhymes written by MCs who looked like me and shared my experiences.”“I’ve always seen writing as a form of activism. If nothing else, books give us a glimpse into lives that we may not have known about before they can promote empathy.”“Freedom of speech isn’t necessarily free, especially when you’re young and black.”“Every time a black girl comes up to me and says, ‘Thank you. It’s the first time I’ve seen myself in a book like this’, that’s better than hitting the New York Times bestseller list.”“Hashtags are nice, but I would ask people to put in some work!

The affluent car-driving youth of the northern districts have turned gridlock into a way of meeting members of the opposite sex.Known as “dor-dor” (“turn-turn” in Farsi), separate groups of young men and women drive around, pulling up alongside each other in congested traffic so they can flirt and pass phone numbers through the window. The cars are either all-girl or all-boy to avoid censorship by the Islamic morality police. If the police do show up they can make a (slow) getaway.By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.This furtive car-cruising is just one of the signs of youthful rebellion against draconian moral codes, and an indication that the Iranian capital might be becoming gradually more relaxed. In Ab-o-Atash park, a teenage girl in skinny jeans and rollerblades allows her headscarf to drop briefly as she coasts past a group of gawping boys. Nearby, a tape of religious music is drowned out by the blaring hip-hop coming from the skatepark. Gaggles of families pose for selfies, while black-cloaked women shuffle past on their way to the mosque.“We never had spaces like this when we were growing up here,” says a middle-aged woman visiting from Canada with her sister, where they have both lived for the past 20 years after moving from Iran. “Even a few years ago, a scene like this would have been unthinkable.”These visions of tolerance and mutual co-existence are a far cry from most foreigners’ preconceived images of Tehran – a place where religious law still forbids women from riding bicycles. On the new Tabiat pedestrian bridge, whose futuristic tendrils wind their way across the valley, young couples sit arm-in-arm, while groups of girls saunter past, their headscarves pulled so far back they seem to defy gravity. “If we’d been seen out with a boy like this,” adds one of the sisters, “we would have been forced to marry them.”This scene of apparent social freedom turns out to be precariously balanced. In 2011, a couple of years after the park opened, 10 people were arrested by the morality police after holding a water fight in the fountains. Two years ago, an extra 7,000 morality police were introduced in Tehran, specifically to monitor the strict hijab rules, targeting everything from loose-fitting headscarves and shortened trousers for women, to glamorous hairstyles and necklaces for men. Given the capital’s population explosion the authorities face an uphill struggle. From the decks of Tabiat bridge, evening crowds – suspended above the bumper-to-bumper traffic of an eight-lane highway – admire the sunset through a thick haze of smog. Cranes stretch to the horizon, conjuring ever taller concrete towers which march incessantly into the surrounding hills.Tehran’s population now numbers around 8.4 million people in the city proper, swelling to 14 million in the wider metropolitan region, making it the most populous city in western Asia. It is set to join the global ranks of megacities by 2035, according to forecasts from the UN, with its residents passing the 10 million mark in 2028.But Tehran is a city on the brink. With some of the world’s highest levels of congestion, air pollution, water shortages, land subsidence and eye-watering costs of living, headscarves should be the least of the authorities’ worries.Stuck in traffic on one of Tehran’s interminable freeways, the city can feel like Los Angeles with minarets. The similarity is no coincidence: its modern urban structure was laid out by America’s own doyen of postwar sprawl, Victor Gruen. The godfather of the suburban shopping mall was hired by the Iranian government in 1966 to masterplan the future of the capital, and plotted a web of highways that would thread their way through the undulating topography, connecting a dispersed network of neighbourhoods separated by lush green valleys. The model was typical of American new towns – only adapted to the foothills of the Alborz mountains.It was part of a wave of projects resulting from the American government’s deep engagement with the ruling Pahlavi dynasty. Come the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the masterplan embodied everything that the new regime stood against: it was the detestable legacy of the Shah writ large across the city. Attempts to make a new plan were rejected by the city, so a decision was made to go on with the Gruen scheme, while gleefully rejecting many of its key principles.There has been a financial incentive behind the city’s expansion too. In the years following the revolution, the municipality realised that a handsome stream of income could be generated by allowing developers to breach the density limits set out in the masterplan in exchange for a substantial fee. Zoning laws were bent and construction permits issued. Revenues collected were then invested in major urban development projects, which in turn increased the value of real estate. The urban form of Tehran was built around a system of institutionalised bribery, which continues to this day.“Anyone can pay a fine and build a high-rise,” says Masoud Taghavi, former editor of Iranian architecture magazine Hamshahri Memari. “There are some plans, but in most cases they’re being ignored. You see highways where they shouldn’t be, buildings where they shouldn’t be, shopping malls where they shouldn’t be.”The practice of selling density has led to an identikit form of residential development, with plots simply filled to their limits and extruded to maximise the saleable floor area. Most are designed without terraces or balconies and with minimal open space around them.The policy has also seen a proliferation of huge commercial buildings with little regard to their wider impact. As chairman of Tehran city council’s health and environment committee, Mohammad Haqqani, put it: “Tehran municipality is granting permits to almost all applicants wishing to construct commercial buildings like shopping malls and office buildings, without paying attention to the real needs of each district and the worsening traffic congestion in the sprawling capital.” Following a spate of high-end malls, a district in northern Tehran finally banned their construction last year. But it is too little too late.Many point the finger at Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Iran’s former chief of police and several-time failed presidential candidate, who served as the mayor of Tehran from 2005 until 2017. He presided over a wealth of impressive-looking trophy projects which introduced a glossy image of modernity – but did little to tackle the city’s real problems.The expansion of the Sadr expressway was one of his most publicised achievements, seeing a three-mile long double-decker concrete highway erected in the north-east of the city. Articles on the project were greeted with comments such as “Long live Tehran’s master builder, the humble accomplisher, Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf,” and “May the eyes of the envious and extremist burst in jealousy.”Those eyes are now watering at the vast expense and unintended consequences of the grand plan, which has had the effect of increasing traffic and further cementing car as king. Members of the Tehran city council conceded last year that adequate research was not conducted before construction began, and that the elevated highway has failed to achieve its main purpose. “It is a disastrous project,” says architect and urbanist Ahmadreza Hakiminejad. “It was hailed as a way of reducing Tehran’s congestion, but it has had the opposite result. If you make more room for cars, you get more cars on the street. More cars means more congestion and more pollution.”All schools in the capital were forced to close one day last year due to the dangerous levels of toxic particles in the air. Pollution causes an annual 20,000 deaths, according to deputy health minister Alireza Raeisi, a statistic that has even prompted the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to weigh in: it is now religiously forbidden to drive vehicles in such high levels of pollution without valid rationale. Ghalibaf put his efforts into applying a thin layer of decoration across Tehran in an attempt to ert people’s attention from its day-to-day dysfunction. The Bureau of Beautification was established to oversee a campaign of murals, bollard paintings and curious sculptures. A stretch of Valiasr Street now has a sculpture garden along one side, where a number of dead trees have been adorned with artwork to disguise the fact they’re stricken due to lack of water. Bus stops have been decorated and novelty benches commissioned – but nothing has changed beneath the surface.Hakiminejad says the beautification campaign and the Sadr expressway are just two of innumerable ill-conceived schemes conducted over the last decade, along with policies that have seen the trampling of the city’s little remaining green space. Over the past decade, around 4,000 hectares of Tehran’s former gardens have been destroyed by the so-called “garden tower” act, which allows people to build high-rises on garden land.Other grand visions, like the satellite development around the artificial Chitgar Lake to the north-west of Tehran, have similarly backfired. The lake has been accused of erting much-needed flows of water from the city, while the surrounding plots have been sold off in the usual fashion, spawning a grim forest of high-rise towers and malls. There are few of the facilities such as schools that a functioning new urban centre needs.“It’s yet another ‘wow’ project, designed more as a tourist attraction than an extension of the city,” says Hakiminejad. “It’s going to end up being a vertical slum.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6eccfd3814bbdcf44232b118257ecc876163e8/0_2880_3202_1920/master/3202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da69955da61c200ae6b2c92196f9c25","title":"concrete city beauty los angeles in pictures","story":"LA is a city of concrete.

The House of Commons Speaker has at times a comic degree of self-esteem that is the equal of the arrogant steward in Twelfth Night. Like Malvolio, Bercow can also drive colleagues to distraction, as he did today. Today, though, Bercow took a brave stand to empower Britain’s parliament against Britain’s government on Brexit. And that qualifies him to be considered the most radical holder of his office in generations. Like Malvolio, a version of greatness has been thrust upon him.The vast majority of people are understandably not well versed in Commons procedure. So it may seem strange to claim that a decision to allow an amendment to be moved on a Commons timetable motion – and with no debate – is in any way immense. Nevertheless, Bercow’s decision to allow the all-party effort, led by the Conservative former attorney general Dominic Grieve, to tie the government’s hands – it must come back with a plan B within three days if the Brexit deal is defeated next week – deserves such accolades.The 11-vote victory for Grieve’s amendment may be pivotal in the Brexit endgame. Coming on top of Tuesday’s seven-vote government defeat on the Yvette Cooper no-deal motion, it is confirmation that Theresa May does not have a majority for her Brexit deal. The path lies open – though the intervening ground remains treacherous – towards either a softer “Norway plus” relationship, or a second referendum that may lead to Britain remaining in the EU after all.None of this would have happened, or even be a possibility, under a more deferential Speaker than Bercow. And it only happened because he has consciously put himself in the front line, over the most important issue of our time, in a long battle to strengthen the power of parliament against ministers. The Speaker may have come to this partly for reasons of his own vanity, or because he dislikes the House leader Andrea Leadsom, or because, with his time as Speaker likely to come to an end this year, he is willing to go out with all guns blazing. But there are far bigger issues at stake in his action too.Bercow took his stand because Brexit has presented modern parliamentary politics with a choice that, in the end, it could not avoid. On the one hand, the Commons could do what modern British parliaments have normally done and, after much huffing and puffing, allow the government to get what it wants. On the other, it could do what parliaments too rarely do, but which many non-partisans have longed for it to do and, working cross-party, drag down the power of ministers and all the patronage and power at their disposal.The confrontation between MPs and ministers that consumed Westminster today was not ultimately caused by Bercow’s ego. It was caused by the convergence of the immensity of Brexit – which threatens to reshape the economy, politics and international standing of Britain in massive ways – and the reality that May leads a deeply ided party and government in a hung parliament where there is no majority for anything without formal or informal cross-party alliances. In such circumstances, the old rules were always likely to buckle and bend and they did so.Parliamentary sovereignty has always been significantly qualified, ever since the Glorious Revolution of 1688-89 laid its modern foundations. Parliament is not in practice a collective Athenian-style assembly that does whatever it chooses, though its powers are sweeping. Parliament is a legislature that is controlled and structured to benefit the executive – even a weak one such as May’s. Parliament’s sovereignty is managed by ministers on behalf of the crown, today as in 1689. It was against this that Bercow took his stand.Over the years there have been repeated complaints – particularly, of course, from the opposition – that parliament’s sovereignty is being systematically gelded by ministers. Under governments of every kind, Labour as well as Conservative, ministers have tightened their grip over backbenchers through systems of appointments, control of the agenda, delegated powers, and timetabling. The growth of the career politician, often at the expense of MPs with wider experience, has made the job of control easier.There has always been some pushback – in the growth of more independent select committees, for example. But it has taken Brexit added to a hung parliament to lift the counter-movement to this new level, in the run-up to the Brexit showdown on 15 January. The implication of Bercow’s decision to call Grieve’s amendment – against the advice, it seems, of his clerks – is that governments will now find it more difficult to control the parliamentary timetable.There is no suggestion that Bercow’s ruling guarantees a better Brexit outcome. Still less that it will open the floodgates to parliament setting its own agenda more generally, or to the Speaker writing the Queen’s speech – backbench power has more purchase in a hung parliament than one with a landslide majority, and Brexit is a uniquely important and isive issue. But the breach in ministerial control has been made all the same. And we have gone, in less than two years, from May’s attempt to implement Brexit without any parliamentary involvement, to a position in which the prime minister is increasingly having her Brexit options shaped for her by a cross-party alliance of MPs.These MPs are, moreover, an exceptionally able and talented bunch. They eclipse many on their own frontbenches. You could almost say that the real leaders of the Tory party are now Nicky Morgan and Nick Boles, while the effective leaders of Labour this week were Yvette Cooper and Stephen Kinnock.It would not, of course, be quite true. The parties and their leaders remain the key players. Nevertheless, a new and more rational form of parliamentary politics is evolving around the old parties. The faith-based politics of left and right is struggling to respond.This is not to claim that faith is unimportant or that pragmatism will triumph. But pragmatism is having a good run, against the odds and in the most important of circumstances. It will surely leave a deep mark, not just on the Brexit outcome next week but also on the politics of the near future more generally. Amid so much failure elsewhere in our political system, this seems worth cherishing and cheering."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/096d8db3313d6023d89f449493c8139201366e2d/0_0_941_573/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1980e905d4c0f40a5abdb0759763789c 1370w","title":"oxford and cambridge reject adonis proposal for access colleges","story":"Senior figures fear creating colleges with remit to improve access could lead to accusations of ‘ghettoisation’A radical proposal by the former education minister Andrew Adonis for a new breed of Oxbridge colleges designed to improve access for under-represented students has been greeted with little enthusiasm by the two universities.Under the plan Oxford and Cambridge universities could speed up their efforts to widen participation by opening new colleges focusing exclusively on “access with excellence”, according to Adonis, the man credited as being the architect of Tony Blair’s education reforms.His scheme, outlined in an article published in the , would see the colleges recruit undergraduates from what he called the “missing 3,000” UK schools that supply few or no successful Oxbridge applicants.But the two universities said they would prefer to concentrate on their existing long-term efforts to widen participation, which they argued have been an unheralded success in improving the numbers of state school and ethnic minority students enrolling.Adonis likened the new colleges to those created for women in the 19th century, including Somerville College, Oxford, and Girton College, Cambridge, and halls for religious dissenters outside the Church of England, such as Mansfield College, Oxford.“These colleges would significantly increase the number of places available for students from schools and families without an Oxbridge tradition. Over time, they might also transform the culture of the two universities,” Adonis said.“Oxbridge vice-chancellors and admissions tutors prattle on about ‘widening access’. But it doesn’t happen, beyond a marginal shift over decades, driven by the constant focus on statistics on the overall private and state school share of places, which favours teenagers from the remaining 160 state grammar schools and the most successful state schools.”But senior figures at both universities fear that creating colleges with a remit to improve access could provoke accusations of “ghettoisation” and social ision.Prof Martin Williams, Oxford’s pro-vice-chancellor for education, said: “We know that our undergraduates value the chance to mix with and learn from fellow students of all backgrounds, including our international students.“Oxford colleges were once segregated on the basis of gender and we don’t want to create new isions on any grounds. We share Lord Adonis’s aspiration to ensure the opportunities of an Oxford education are open to all talented students but his plan does not offer the across-the-board change we are looking for.”The university has taken radical steps in recent years, including the launch of a foundation year for talented but disadvantaged young people at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, led by the former  editor Alan Rusbridger, while a further group of colleges are looking at starting a joint foundation year programme.Prof Williams said Oxford worked “incredibly hard” in its access efforts, contacting and visiting more than 3,000 schools across the UK each year.“That said, we know we have more work to do. We are actively developing new policies to deliver step-change in the students who consider and successfully apply for an Oxford education.”A spokesperson for Cambridge said the university was aiming to raise £500m to fund additional access and outreach work, which would see it spend far more than any other UK university.“Cambridge is making consistent progress in reaching students from under-represented groups. In the 2017 intake, we admitted more state school pupils than ever previously recorded,” the university said.“We know we can do better still but we cannot do it in isolation. As a country, we must focus on raising ambitions and attainment levels in schools and on changing perceptions among parents and teachers.”In a similar proposal, a paper published by the Higher Education Policy Institute called for grammar schools in England to be allowed to expand into areas of disadvantage to boost the numbers of pupils from those areas entering Oxbridge and similar universities.“Compared to other countries, we have a hyper-selective university system. Given so many people benefit from attending a grammar school, it seems what works for universities may also sometimes work for schools,” said Nick Hillman, HEPI’s chief executive.But the paper’s analysis was criticised as naive and misleading by academics who have studied education and social mobility.“As the vast majority of disadvantaged children do not attend the grammar schools, the negative impact is likely to dominate any positive impact for those that do such that overall social mobility it harmed by grammar schools,” said Lindsey Macmillan of UCL and Matt Dickson of the University of Bath."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89b05fef227166d0ba813badb0b439d04b9e37aa/0_293_5683_3412/master/5683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ea1a252ba8c69b5d4da0bc64c1fb18c","title":"teacher bursaries are a 22m waste of money says labour","story":"Payments of up to £25,000 to recruit top graduates are failing badly, analysis findsLabour has accused the government of squandering taxpayers’ money on bursaries of up to £25,000 and beyond to attract top graduates into teaching, many of whom then fail to take up teaching posts.According to Labour analysis of Department for Education (DfE) data, trainee teachers awarded the highest bursary of £25,000 and above were the least likely to end up in a teaching post, compared with those on smaller bursaries or no financial incentive at all.Bursaries are intended to attract high-quality graduates into teaching, particularly in priority subjects where it is often hard to recruit, but according to Labour they are failing to keep top teachers in the profession and are therefore a waste of public money.The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “The government’s strategy to deal with the teacher recruitment and retention crisis they have created is failing badly, and it is taxpayers who are paying the price for the failures of Tory ministers.“They have missed recruitment targets in six consecutive years and their inability to attract high-achieving graduates to the profession is wasting taxpayers’ money and letting students down.”The bursaries offered by the DfE depend on qualifications and subject, and are among a number of measures being used by the government to address the teacher recruitment crisis in the UK and increase the quality of teachers.According to Labour analysis, in 2015-16 nearly £22m was spent on bursaries for trainees who did not go on to take up a teaching post. More than £6.1m of that went on top £25,000-plus payments for graduates with firsts in chemistry, computing, mathematics, modern foreign languages and physics.The analysis comes as the education secretary, Damian Hinds, prepares to launch the government’s teacher recruitment and retention strategy.Official statistics published in November revealed the government had missed its teacher training targets in most secondary school subjects.The DfE roundly rejected Labour’s criticisms of the bursaries policy. According to officials, though the employment rate for bursary-holders who qualify as teachers is lower than the equivalent rate for non-bursary-holders, it is down to the quality of the graduates who attract bursaries who are in greater demand elsewhere in the economy, rather than the award of a bursary itself.The schools standards minister, Nick Gibb, said: “Our bursaries and scholarships are not just an exercise in increasing teacher numbers.“They are specifically tailored so that we attract the right candidates for certain vital subjects and developed with bodies such as the Institute of Physics and the Royal Society of Chemistry.“This is especially important in a competitive graduate labour market with unemployment at its lowest level since the 1970s.“In addition to these bursaries, we are working with school leaders and unions on a strategy to drive recruitment, boost retention and strip away unnecessary workload, to ensure that teaching remains an attractive and fulfilling profession.”The DfE is testing new financial incentives for mathematics teachers – who are in particularly short supply – including upfront bursaries of £20,000 and a maths scholarship worth £22,000. These are followed by two additional payments of up to £7,500 to encourage talented maths teachers to stay in the profession.Jack Worth, the school workforce lead at the National Foundation for Educational Research, said: “There has been a long-term need to attract teachers into subjects such as maths and science which offer the highest bursaries.“However, they are mostly aimed at increasing recruitment into training and, in order to be effective and offer good value for money, bursaries need to be coupled with a robust retention strategy.”Rayner promised teachers more money under Labour. “Years of real-terms pay cuts have made it impossible for schools to recruit the staff they need, and teachers are leaving the profession in record numbers,” she said.“There is a generation of children paying the price for Tory failure in our schools.“Through our National Education Service, Labour will invest in our schools and provide ringfenced funding to give teachers the pay rise they deserve.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d1d506cb813571aca7a2f193cb52d4df64a2a99/0_1_2497_1498/master/2497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c57808788f9c27f42b7d51618d8db37","title":"colette film author french keira knightley","story":"A new biopic of Colette starring Keira Knightley explores the enduring appeal of the French novelist, polymath and style legendOpen Colette’s Wikipedia entry and – just as with one of her novels – you’re hooked right away. “She was a French author and woman of letters, also known as a mime, actress and journalist, nominated for the Nobel prize in literature in 1948.” She wrote more than 30 novels and was called “the greatest living French writer of fiction” by the New York Times, just before her death in 1954.That’s not to mention her status as the ultimate cat lover. Thanks to Colette, feline fans on Instagram have an almost endless supply of quotes for captions (“Our perfect companions never have fewer than four feet” is a personal favourite). The other accolade missing from that impressive CV? Style icon.Colette, born in 1873, came of age as photography became popularised. When the cheap and easy-to-use Kodak Brownie became available in 1900, she was 27 and already a personality in Paris.She was photographed in thinker’s pose at her desk in a polka dot blouse lounging with two cats and matching feline eye makeup smoking in a man’s suit in black stockings and dancewear backstage before a performance … In almost every picture, her kohl-rimmed eyes meet the viewer’s (and the photographer’s, more than likely a man) with confidence. Colette offers a lesson in how a woman can use style to take ownership of her image – ensuring that she always has the last word.Colette famously drew on her colourful life for her novels, including her experience of being a dancer in music halls (The Vagabond) and having an affair with a much younger man (Chéri and The Last of Chéri) the breakthrough Claudine series was inspired by her school days. The expressive “this is me” shrug of her attitude is just as refreshing today as it was more than a century ago. It cuts through the decades much like her way of wearing men’s tailoring – in soft velvet with lashings of eye makeup and jaunty neckscarves. Colette, the new biopic in cinemas this week with Keira Knightley in the title role, focuses on the author’s formative years. Growing up in the Burgundy countryside, she met Henry Gauthier-Villars AKA Willy, a controversial author and socialite who was an acquaintance of her father’s. He was 14 years her senior they married in 1893. As the film tells it, Colette used fashion as a way to express her transformation from a country girl in frills and long plaits to Parisian It-girl with a bob and a trouser suit (sidenote: Knightley’s leg of mutton blouses and cropped boleros could also work in 2019).Andrea Flesch, the film’s costume designer, says Colette’s style reflected not only her journey, but also the shifts in society at the turn of the century.The author herself was no slouch when it came to branding, either. Born Sidonie-Gabrielle, she became known by only her surname while she was still at school, recognising way before Madonna that a single moniker announces your importance from the get-go. After she separated from Willy, who famously plagiarised his wife, in 1906, this approach helped her as she became a giant of French literature.Those taking style inspiration from novelists such as Colette reflect a wider, more highbrow trend in fashion: US novelist Joan Didion featured in a Celine campaign in 2015 French New Wave director Agnès Varda is the cover star of The Gentlewoman autumn edition, while painter Georgia O’Keefe’s personal style was featured in the New Yorker last year.Terry Newman, in the coffee table book Legendary Authors and the Clothes They Wore, describes how Colette used clothes to “radiate character, both in her own life and in the lives of the characters she created in her writing”. That influence has endured in some surprising ways, from retail to Hollywood: she lent her name to Colette, the cult Parisian boutique that became an industry favourite before closing after 20 years in 2017. And Colette discovered Givenchy muse Audrey Hepburn, casting the almost-unknown actor in the stage version of her novel Gigi in 1951.Always in the avant garde, Colette was also a pioneer in her acceptance of androgyny and sexuality that was, then, taboo: the film shows the author’s relationship with aristocrat Mathilde de Morny, or Missy, who was gay and wore men’s clothes.Flesch says Missy changed Colette’s style – a moment dramatised in the biopic when Knightley wears a pair of cycling culottes to stroll around a Parisian park. “Wearing trousers was a statement from Missy,” says Flesch. “She was scandalous, and she was accepted because she was a noblewoman and rich. Colette wanted to show she was on the same level. She wanted to shock as well.”Style isn’t a footnote of Colette’s legacy, it’s a central part of it. Sixty-five years after her death, her influence extends beyond your bookshelf, Instagram captions and cinema: Colette’s free spirit is inspiring our wardrobes, too.Colette is released in the UK this week "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17a3799341e5ff10a21a5abda943c2e4851e1187/0_360_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7878c7452aeaa4f35505b8e4da726559","title":"lfwm art school afterparty london fashion week men in pictures","story":"Tom Barratt and Eden Loweth’s first stand-alone Art School catwalk show opened London fashion week men’s at the weekend, celebrating the non-binary form with models cast to ‘push forward notions of otherness’.

With that in mind, here’s a last-ditch appeal to the Academy on behalf of 11 performers who’ve been snubbed by the awards-season-industrial complex – some on account of admittedly stiff competition, others because they appear in smaller, less Oscar-baity films that staged less robust PR campaigns, and a few, sadly, because the movies in which they appear aren’t in English.Yes, the race for best actress is as stacked with terrific performances as it’s been in years, but the exclusion of Carey Mulligan from the conversation is as strange and egregious an oversight as they come. In Wildlife, the directorial debut from Paul Dano, Mulligan plays Jeanette, a 1960s housewife left to her own devices after her unemployed husband abandons her and her son to fight wildfires in the forests of Montana. In a narrative presented mostly from the perspective of Jeanette’s teenage son, Joe, Mulligan gives the best acting performance of the year, male or female: she’s fickle, fierce, combustible and impish, her tone of voice often oscillating from cheerful to coarse in accordance with the character’s mood. In a story that’s more or less about a kid coming to recognize and reckon with his parent’s flaws, Mulligan plays Jeanette with a thrilling unpredictability that calls to mind Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence – and forces us, as viewers, to recount the moment we realized our parents were human, too.In a film with a cast as numerous and decorated as Widows’ ensemble – Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Carrie Coon, Bryan Tyree Henry, Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, and Jacki Weaver are all here – it takes a real howitzer of a performance to stand out from the bunch. But in Steve McQueen’s follow-up to 12 Years a Slave, Daniel Kaluuya and Elizabeth Debicki do just that, occupying opposite ends of the film’s vast and frequently fluctuating moral continuum. As Jatemme Manning, the mob enforcer to his brother Jamal’s political campaign, Kaluuya oozes menace: to look into his eyes as he stares down a lackey spitting a few rap bars is to vow never to freestyle again. Debicki, meanwhile, is the film’s heart, a damaged woman in thrall to her abusive mother and husband who joins the Viola Davis-led heist and convinces you her life depends it. Both performances, though overlooked by most awards bodies (save a few critics’ groups), are emotionally rich but tactful, too, governed less by histrionics than meaningful glances and grimaces.The star of the year’s best film, Roma’s Yalitza Aparicio, still has an outside shot at nabbing a best actress nomination. But in a crowded year for supporting actress, headlined by Regina King, Amy Adams and the women of The Favourite, Aparicio’s co-star Marina de Tavira has fallen through the cracks. That’s a shame, since what she does with her role as the matriarch of a household in turmoil is pretty breathtaking. Her character Sofia swings like a pendulum she lets out strident commands (“¿Adónde vas?” she screams at her disobedient son) provides comic relief (watch her attempt to wriggle her Ford Galaxy between two trucks on a Mexico City freeway) and allows her character’s compassion and dejection to surface in gestures both big and small, a vast arsenal of actorly gifts at her disposal. “No matter what they tell you, as women, we are always alone,” she says to Cleo in a moment of desolation that’s brilliantly, perhaps surprisingly, punctuated by a burst of drunken physical comedy. In the humble opinion of this writer, it was the year’s second-best performance (a smidgen behind Mulligan).The year’s best, most cryptic villain – a personification of the “you v the guy she told you not to worry about” meme – was Steven Yeun’s Ben in Burning, the director Lee Chang-dong’s hypnotizing adaptation of Haruki Murakami’s short story. Think Jay Gatsby meets Patrick Bateman meets Dickie Greenleaf: Yeun plays this smooth-talking cosmopolite with a pathological charm that never quite reveals itself in full, which is precisely what makes the characterization so uniquely chilling and seductive. It’s a testament to Yeun’s commitment that Ben’s veneer of disquieting swagger never breaks: he yawns, laughs, speaks, smokes, shakes hands and discloses his casual pyromania all with the same air of arrogant self-possession. Critics’ groups out of Chicago, Los Angeles and Toronto recognized Yeun as the year’s best supporting actor, so perhaps it isn’t asking too much that the Academy take note too.This 20-year-old actor’s debut in Josephine Decker’s brilliant Madeline’s Madeline is on par with Natalie Portman in Black Swan and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York, in the pantheon of art-and-life-blurring roles. A gifted actress in a New York City-based experimental theatre troupe, and a mercurial teenager on the verge of a psychotic break, Howard’s Madeline is that rare characterization of an adolescent that’s refreshingly unmoored from convention. Immersed in her subjectivity, we experience Madeline’s sense of disorientation in the world and then watch her bring pain and suffering into uncomfortably sharp focus, particularly in a dramatic monologue in which she’s asked to portray her own mother. In a year of outstanding film debuts from young female actors (Aparicio in Roma, Elsie Fisher in Eight Grade, Kiki Layne in If Beale Street Could Talk), Howard’s was particularly noteworthy.In the wake of the Golden Globes, Christian Bale may very well ride his win to a best actor Oscar, with Bradley Cooper and Viggo Mortensen trailing close behind. Each represents a different version of the kind of muscular, immersive leading performance the Academy likes to honor. What Lakeith Stanfield does in Boots Riley’s Sorry to Bother You, however, is considerably different. As Cassius “Cash” Green, an upwardly mobile telemarketer, Stanfield is often comically incredulous. Despite his ascent in the world of tech, things happen to Cash more often than he makes them happen, and Stanfield plays it with a certain affable bemusement. It’s one of those performances that works in service of a film-maker’s vision, in this case Riley’s wild satire of a late-capitalist wasteland and its machine full of cogs.Rare is a protagonist, especially a female, middle-aged protagonist, as multitudinous as Isabelle of Claire Denis’ radiant romcom Let the Sunshine In, the lifeblood of which is Juliette Binoche’s effusive, heartfelt and guileless lead performance as a woman looking for love. Isabelle, and as far as we can tell, Binoche too, feels everything to the fullest extent, and throughout the film, a dialogue-heavy procession of encounters with different men, her face is a transient canvas of emotions experienced not one-by-one but all at once. Watch her, for instance, in the film’s final scene, a long discussion with a clairvoyant who predicts the future of Isabelle’s various dalliances. His every ination is met with its own reaction: Isabelle’s neck tenses up, or she laughs incredulously, or her smile broadens, or her lips purse. It’s a nakedly human and life-affirming performance from one of our greatest actors.The slow burn and eventual emotional gut punch of Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters is reflected most clearly in the supporting performance of Sakura Andô, who plays her character, Nobuyo, with a delicate touch not dissimilar to the film’s direction. She is sincere but necessarily stealthy, loving and devious, easily one of the most sympathetic and likable characters on film this year, which is odd if you come across a bare-boned synopsis of the movie: a family of savvy shoplifters kidnaps a young girl. In a scene where Nobuyo is interrogated by Japanese police, her eyes evince profound sadness and principled determination, like vectors for Kore-eda and the film’s touching exploration of a family linked by trust instead of blood.If it were up to me, Joaquin Phoenix would have two Oscars to his name and a third – for his performance as Joe in Lynne Ramsey’s You Were Never Really Here – on the way. Alas, Phoenix’s harsh, uncompromising turn as a hired gun who rescues sex-trafficked young girls has been mostly ignored by major awards bodies and critics’ groups, even though he took home the best actor prize at the Cannes film festival, where the film premiered in 2017. Here, Phoenix and his body appear more lived-in than ever, the lines that branch across his face suggesting toil and trauma. With more action than talk, Phoenix and Ramsey invite us into the character’s wounded headspace, effectively evoking the sense of rage and violent resolve that compels him to do what he does.As if the best actress conversation weren’t crowded enough, here’s another tour de force to consider. As a kindergarten teacher and failed poet in Sara Colangelo’s remake of the 2015 Israeli film of the same name, Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the year’s most anxiety-inducing performance, embodying obsessive compulsion and intellectual unease. Her character Lisa takes what seems like an innocent, maternal interest in the poetic ingenuity of one of her students, seeing it as her responsibility to cultivate his talent before it’s soiled, presumably like her own, by an increasingly vainglorious world. What ensues is a crescendo of discomfiting events that are both more and less ethically ambiguous than they feel, anchored by Gyllenhaal’s tremendous ability to be entirely consumed by her character’s one-track mind and strange sense of duty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99cefcc6ec2abed8f205f53940df512dd81ba16f/0_107_3890_2333/master/3890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=256934e5aa8901266450bfef889b9ff5","title":"pixar john lasseter skydancce animation times up","story":"John Lasseter will head up Skydance Animation in a move that ‘endorses and perpetuates a broken system’ according to a Time’s Up statementEx-Pixar head John Lasseter has scored a top new position in Hollywood, leading to a backlash from within the industry.Lasseter took a leave of absence from Pixar and Disney after admitting “missteps” related to his treatment of female colleagues. The cofounder of Pixar Animation Studios and the animation chief of Walt Disney Company apologised for anyone upset by an “unwanted hug” or “any other gesture” that was perceived as crossing the line.The Hollywood Reporter has cited Lasseter’s misbehaviour as “grabbing, kissing, making comments about physical attributes” and his original leave of absence was later extended to a resignation.His new position sees him heading up Skydance Animation, a strand within Skydance Media, a production company run by David Ellison, who founded the company with inheritance money from his billionaire father Larry Ellison. The company, affiliated with Paramount Pictures, has released a string of hit films from World War Z to Star Trek Beyond.“Let me be clear: we have not entered into this decision lightly,” Ellison wrote in a company memo. “While we would never minimize anyone’s subjective views on behavior, we are confident after many substantive conversations with John, and as the investigation has affirmed, that his mistakes have been recognised. We are certain that John has learned valuable lessons and is ready to prove his capabilities as a leader and a colleague.”According to Variety, a town hall meeting is planned at Skydance for concerns while Lasseter is set to meet with staff this week.The news has led to anger from some within the industry, including Time’s Up, the organisation founded to stand up against sexual harassment after the rise of the #MeToo movement.In a statement, Time’s Up claims the decision “endorses and perpetuates a broken system that allows powerful men to act without consequence” while sharing concerns over what impact it will have.“At a moment when we should be uplifting the many talented voices who are consistently underrepresented, Skydance Media is providing another position of power, prominence and privilege to a man who has repeatedly been accused of sexual harassment in the workplace,” it reads.Melissa Silverstein, who founded Women in Hollywood, also shared her frustration. “This is a horrible message to the women at Pixar who stood up and told their truths about their experiences,” she said. “This is also a message to all that the bro culture is alive and well and thriving in Hollywood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61053319edf480958739557b1ed7491a7965bf9/710_13_2794_1677/master/2794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c5dc6df4f6a988e0960fc77ae1d9aa2","title":"the front runner review gary hart donna rice us presidency","story":"Hugh Jackman stars as the US Democrat whose presidential ambitions were scuppered by allegations of misbehaviour aboard the Monkey BusinessIs there any point now in remembering Gary Hart? He was the Democrats’ plausible and photogenic US presidential candidate in 1988, the front runner who abandoned his campaign after press allegations of an extramarital affair. Was he, like the charismatic Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell, a lost prince of progressive American politics – a man who might have saved his country from the complacent Bush dynasty? Or was he just another withdrawn brand in what Gore Vidal called the eternally dull PepsiCoke choice of American democracy?It’s not easy to tell from Jason Reitman’s clotted and evasive movie, starring Hugh Jackman in a hairpiece as Hart. The film somehow shows its hero as a tiresome and sanctimonious figure while piously averting its eyes from his misdemeanour, the one thing that makes Hart dramatically interesting – his supposed sexual encounter with the young would-be campaign worker Donna Rice. The movie shows Hart going to the party on board the boat in Miami (unfortunately and notoriously called Monkey Business) and meeting Rice, but solemnly declines to show her face or what precisely went on. For a while, it seems as if having a mysterious void where Rice should be might constitute the film’s stylised and rather experimental rationale, maybe to suggest the alienated, dehumanised nature of politics.But no. After a solid hour, Rice is finally produced on camera (a perfectly capable and forthright performance from Sara Paxton), tearfully telling her story to Hart’s careworn spin doctors as the media storm breaks. It feels pointless and supercilious to have withheld her presence until this moment, as if the movie itself has been uneasily forced to acknowledge this woman’s existence, just like Hart’s tense campaign team was. She gets a perfunctory scene designed to show that she has feelings and a college degree, too, and a budding sisterly relationship with a concerned young (fictional) woman on Hart’s staff. Then she departs the stage. And the film is crucially uncertain whether to feel angry at the media’s new tabloid tactics, or to welcome a brusque new honesty, after the press had so long winked at the adulterous antics of JFK and the like. Jackman – rightly or wrongly ­– portrays Hart as an unrelaxed, unsmiling figure, without the charm or buoyancy of his other, recent performances. Vera Farmiga has the thankless and underwritten role of his loyal wife Lee, and JK Simmons plays the gruff campaign manager Bill Dixon. Together, they all inhabit a world chock-full of mannerisms borrowed from Robert Altman’s Nashville and Alan J Pakula’s All the President’s Men, particularly in the very showy but very pointless sequence in the crowded convention centre in 1984 when Hart abandons his first run at power. The camera roams this way and that in the media scrum, and as in subsequent scenes, the dialogue is overlapping and borderline unintelligible. It is bravura work in its way, but unconnected to any real dramatic energy or political point.Later, we get some by-the-numbers scenes at the Washington Post, with Alfred Molina as Ben Bradlee and everyone doing cynical-wisecrack journalist dialogue to each other. When the Miami Herald gets a sniff of the Hart story from an anonymous informant, there is a bizarre scene in which its journalists have to stake out the candidate’s Washington townhouse for their somewhat chaotic scoop. In fact, as they realise that it is a scoop, the film gets its own weirdly residual buzz of conspiratorial excitement, which is rather undermined in the Washington Post scene when Bob Woodward haughtily declines to spill the beans about the personal lives of important people he knows.And never at any time is there a scene between Hart and Rice – a scene that might have humanised them both and actually made Hart politically interesting – and not much of one between Hart and his wife, when he is forced to withdraw. We prudently finish the story before the discovery of that embarrassing photo with Rice sitting on Hart’s lap.So why in the end is Hart interesting? Because he made Bush Sr possible? Maybe. Or perhaps it’s more that he, paradoxically, made Bill Clinton possible, and the voters, wearied by the lacklustre Bush presidency, were prepared to give philandering Bill a chance in 1992. Which perhaps means the second question is: did loyal Lee Hart make Hillary Clinton possible? I’d like to see a whole film about Lee, or a whole film about Donna."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecf7f8badcfcf484cf9638f82c607f030224bc34/0_206_1682_1009/master/1682.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03d8068027032799d7181cbe4f948895","title":"fizz cocktail tablets bitter artificial with a vibe of a mens urinals","story":"Dropping one of these into even the cheapest bubbly is an act of liquid vandalismIt was with a degree of trepidation that I approached FIZZ. It is billed as an effervescent tablet that can transform a glass of champagne, cava or prosecco into a full-blown fruity cocktail, but I couldn’t help thinking that combining FIZZ with fizz suggested imminent disaster. Wouldn’t the tablets – essentially a booze-friendly Berocca but with none of the boring old vitamins – make your glass of fizz foam up over the glass and all over your living-room floor, embarrassing you in front of all your glamorous party guests?Reasoning that this would be a hideous design flaw and therefore surely not likely, I dropped my first FIZZ tablet into a flute of prosecco and watched as the fizz foamed up over my glass and all over my living-room floor, embarrassing me in front of all my … well, let’s just say it’s fortunate that I have no glamorous friends.Unfortunately, FIZZ only got worse from here. The tablets come in three flavours – elderflower, rhubarb and tropical passion fruit. I sampled the latter, and it tasted … how can we put this? … less than great. Bitter, artificial and with the undeniable “vibe” of a men’s urinals, the majority of the glass went down the sink. Judging by the taste of it, it might just have helped with unblocking it, too. To do this to a glass of even the cheapest fizz is an act of liquid vandalism, heaven forbid anyone who considers dropping one into a glass of Pol Roger Brut Réserve.Items such as FIZZ are tempting because they tap into our desire for quick fixes and “hacks”, when sometimes skill, experience and the ability to throw an aluminium shaker over your head while flashing a white-toothed smile should be valued instead. Making a good cocktail, like making most food and drink, requires love, not a tablet. Besides, a drop of Chambord or fruit juice are far more effective ways to jazz up a glass of bubbly.Admittedly, FIZZ was slightly more pleasant when dropped in a glass of tonic water – although mild urine notes persisted. And when dissolved in half a pint of water it was almost verging on the drinkable. But it will not improve your champagne.Instead, it makes it look like a science experiment and taste like the inside of your mouth during the low point of a nasty illness. FIZZ fails on all tests – unless, that is, you are struggling with Dry January, in which case, it might just provide the perfect solution."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26c7d02f9874f4bdc127fcb4ad6462b5d76a1434/0_125_3199_1919/master/3199.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=660bf05c94e0640182103d25e42ecd47","title":"aaron ramsey arsenal juventus five year deal 36m","story":"Aaron Ramsey has agreed a five-year deal with Juventus worth £36m and will join the Italian champions on a free transfer at the end of the season. The midfielder has been discussing a move for weeks and will leave Arsenal after 10 years at the club.It had been clear the Wales international would move in the summer and Juventus had been the frontrunners to secure the 28-year-old’s signature. Ramsey will be paid around £140,000 a week (£7.2m a season), making him Juventus’s second-highest earner behind Cristiano Ronaldo but ahead Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa.Juventus, who have won the past seven Serie A titles, signed Ronaldo for €100m last summer and are nine points clear of Napoli in second place after 19 games. They have reached two of the last four Champions League finals, albeit losing both, to Barcelona in 2015 and Real Madrid two years later. They are in the last 16 of this season’s competition, where they face Atlético Madrid.The Juventus manager, Max Allegri, and the director Fabio Paratici are huge admirers of Ramsey, who is likely to be given a place in the Juventus starting XI, most likely playing with Miralem Pjanic and Blaise Matuidi in a three-man midfield. He is likely to replace one of Emre Can, Rodrigo Bentancur and Sami Khedira, with the latter possibly leaving the club in the summer.Ramsey signed for Arsenal from Cardiff for £4.8m. He has played 252 top-flight games for the club, scoring 52 goals. He won three FA Cups, scoring the winning goal in the 2014 and 2017 finals.He played arguably the best football of his career during Euro 2016 when Wales reached the semi-finals, although he was suspended for the last-four game when Portugal beat Chris Coleman’s team 2-0.Ramsey has had his injury problems but Juventus are delighted to have secured him on a free transfer, while Arsenal will regret seeing a player in the prime of his career leave under these circumstances.With Arsenal choosing to renew the contract of Mesut Özil – another star whose deal was due to expire this summer – they put themselves in a position where they could not re-sign Ramsey too. The Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, also had major reservations about both Özil and Ramsey fitting into his plans and the style he wants to play."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50b6ccfed6a27eebe0628b585c44621cde8fb077/202_0_1094_656/master/1094.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f731bf87a064401c309d572fee5aa0d6","title":"nigel clough guardiola wine burton manchester city 9 0 carabao cup","story":"Nigel Clough managed to retain his sense of humour after Burton’s 9-0 trouncing by Manchester City by stating he hoped Pep Guardiola had “more than one glass” of wine on offer for the post-match drink.Burton’s heavy defeat in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg at the Etihad Stadium ended their hopes of reaching the final, yet when asked what his opposite number told him at full time Clough remained light-hearted. “He said: ‘Come in for a glass of wine.’ I hope he’s got more than a glass,” said the visiting manager, who insists his side will use the return leg in a fortnight to celebrate reaching the last four.“Do I wish we hadn’t played? Not at all, we have made history in getting this far. It wasn’t about tonight it was about the achievement of getting here. We kept going right to the end, they were shouting: ‘We want 10’. And we stopped them, that’s a positive for us.“I told them that front five, if they reach the Champions League semi-final, will give Real Madrid or whoever they play a problem.”As Clough paid tribute to City’s attacking quintet of Gabriel Jesus, Riyad Mahrez, Leroy Sané, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva, Guardiola referenced Clough’s late father, Brian, who is considered one of the greatest domestic managers. “His father showed him some tricks,” said City’s manager. “You know better than me what Clough means – all he won – and the respect for the way he played, his charisma. It’s an honour for me personally to play against a Clough.“I wanted to congratulate them for an incredible tournament. They beat mythical teams – like Aston Villa and Middlesbrough. We’re not a team who has a lot of titles in our museum so you have to take these chances to get to the final.

The Austrian is West Ham’s joint-top scorer with eight goals in all competitions and is seen as a crucial part of Manuel Pellegrini’s plans.West Ham have dealt with plenty of speculation concerning Arnautovic since his £24m move from Stoke  in July 2017. He was linked with Manchester United last summer and recently said he could be tempted to pursue a transfer to a club in the Champions League.However there is a suspicion that Arnautovic, who is represented by his brother Danijel, will try to use the interest from China to convince West Ham to award him an improved contract.Two years on from losing Dimitri Payet to Marseille, West Ham are aware it would be a PR disaster to sell another of their best players. Arnautovic has become their most important forward in the past 12 months and his recent spell on the sidelines with a hamstring injury underlined his importance to Pellegrini, who does not want to have to sign a replacement this month.West Ham’s position is hardened by the knowledge their other strikers are not in Arnautovic’s class. Javier Hernández has been inconsistent since signing from Bayer Leverkusen in 2017 and Andy Carroll, whose injury record counts against him, is out of contract in the summer. West Ham will wait until the end of the season before deciding whether to offer Carroll a deal.Lucas Pérez could be set to leave six months after his £4m move from Arsenal. However West Ham are yet to receive any bids for the forward despite reports suggesting he is a target for Real Betis and Deportivo La Coruña."},{"url":null,"title":"marie kondo you know what would spark joy buying less crap","story":"Those glossy garbage bags filled with unwanted stuff don’t just vanish – they are filling up landfills and polluting our oceansThere’s always the garbage bag shot. In Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, the Netflix series starring the Japanese decluttering expert turned bestselling author, there’s always at least one lingering shot of trash. Glossy plastic bags, bulging with rubbish and stacked precariously. The more bags, the better – one of the couples featured estimated they chucked out 150 full bags.There the bags are, neatly tied up and ready to disappear, leaving the tidiers happier, healthier and relieved of all the crap they’ve been lugging around for years. It’s the shot that screams: Success! You’ve been Kondo-d! Your life is about to get infinitely better!And it’s the shot that illustrates the problem we all have with wastefulness – which Kondo is not helping.A few years ago I followed the KonMari method, the step-by-step decluttering guide laid out in Kondo’s bestselling books. It’s pretty straightforward: go through each and every thing you own, category by category, hold it close to decide whether it “sparks joy”, then discard it if it doesn’t, or store it neatly if it does.It felt great. My apartment wasn’t exactly a minimalist heaven but I got a kick out of my well organised kitchen cupboards and my smaller pile of T-shirts stacked in descending colour order. My cutlery drawer was neater and my crockery matched – that strange, unused orange cup and saucer someone gave me was now sitting in a box outside a charity shop, waiting to spark joy in someone else.That’s the thing though – what happens next? Where do all those bags go? The Konmari method emphasises getting rid of stuff, but it doesn’t all just vanish. We drop off the garbage bags, then forget about them as we return to our newly organised homes. Out of sight, out of mind.Most of those op shop bags will end up in landfill, alongside the bags of outright garbage. And it costs charities millions to send it to the dump. These days landfills around the world are overflowing with stuff that didn’t spark joy.We’re chucking out more than greying T-shirts and old tax receipts. While that cotton T-shirt only cost you $10, there were countless resources that went into it: the materials, the water, the energy, the labour, the transport and the packaging is all being wasted too.And we really can’t afford to say “yeah-nah”. According to the World Bank, we are currently producing more than 2 billion tonnes of garbage each year, with that figure set to jump to 3.4 billion in the next 30 years. Landfills around the world are overflowing, with Australians throwing out 6,000kg of clothing into landfill every 10 minutes.Recycling is not a cure-all. Last year China sparked a global recycling crisis when it closed its doors to imports of contaminated recycled material. Around the world, local councils stockpiled recycling or sent it straight to landfill.Dumping unwanted stuff at charity shops isn’t the answer either. Only a tiny percentage of clothing donated, for instance, goes on sale. The unusable junk is sent to landfill, much of the rest is exported to impoverished countries, where it is on-sold relatively cheaply to the population. That sounds good in theory but, in reality, it can have a devastating impact on local markets, given the variable quality of secondhand clothes. It can also limit the development of local industries, and can speed up the demise of traditional clothes. Why make something original when there are cheap jeans and designer knock-off tops readily available?There is another Japanese tradition that Kondo – and the rest of us – could embrace. It’s called mottainai. It has a long history but essentially it expresses regret at the idea of waste and reflects an awareness of interdependence and impermanence of things. Mottainai is all about reusing, repurposing, repairing and respecting items. How powerful it would have been to see Kondo chopping up old T-shirts for cleaning cloths to replace sponges or paper towels. Or perhaps she could have encouraged her desperate hoarders to repair their old shoes, bicycles and kitchen appliances, instead of turfing them?There are plenty of alternatives to the rubbish dump for those who really can’t stand to reuse or repurpose things that aren’t zinging with joy. In Australia, apart from selling it on eBay or Gumtree, there are local swap groups on Facebook or charity groups looking to pick up unwanted furniture and clothes for those in need. It may not deliver that instant clean apartment feeling, but the goods will end up going to a better home.Most of all, I wish Marie Kondo would just say stop! Stop buying all this stuff. The only solution to our waste crisis is to halt the consumerism clogging our landfills, polluting our oceans and overcrowding our homes. Because what would really spark joy would be a world that isn’t overflowing with garbage.

The main question is how to fit it all in? Our Scouse insider brings you the lowdownI might be biased but I’ve long held the belief that Liverpool is The Best City In The World™. Being a port city historically, it has all the multiculturalism (and variety and spice) of London, but the closeness, community and solidarity of a smaller community – one that faces challenges and adversity together. In other words, don’t mess with Liverpool we’re feisty.For a relatively small city, Liverpool has a lot going on. If you’re planning a visit – and you should, there are affordable trains running from London, Birmingham and elsewhere with London Northwestern Railway – it’s hard to know where to start. Here are my recommendations for 24 hours in Liverpool, from the old favourites you’ve definitely heard of to a couple of things that only a local would know.Eating out, or ‘going for a scran’ in ScouseApparently, breakfast is the most important meal of the day – and there’s nowhere better to kick off your trip to Liverpool than Brasco Lounge. It’s the perfect place to start the day and start falling in love with Liverpool.During the 1980s the Albert Dock was nothing more than derelict ruins, but thanks to some heavy investment it’s now the most picturesque spot in town filled with pretty shops, exclusive bars and some of the most expensive apartments in the city. Brasco Lounge faces this and has its back to the Pier Head (home to the iconic Liver Building). Inside Brasco you’ll find an eclectic mix of antiques, vintage art and reclaimed wooden tables all bathed in natural light. And what does natural light translate to? Unreal food pictures for “the gram”, that’s what. May I recommend the eggs benedict or florentine, which are the best of either I’ve ever had.If you’re arriving for lunch, grab a bite and quick pic at Love Thy Neighbour on Bold Street, which gets my prize for most creative use of pink paint in the city. Sitting at the end of a row of shops, it boasts a huge blank wall to the side – so they painted it pink and adorned it with illustrations and mantras, the most famous of which being “Avocado is bae”. It’s loved by locals, visitors and bloggers alike for its healthy food, designed to make you feel beautiful inside and out, and its unusual cocktails – beetroot bloody mary anyone? It’s a great place for a spot of lunch, people-watching and getting those all-important holiday snaps.For something a little more eco, there’s Down the Hatch, a vegetarian and vegan restaurant with a difference: it’s not berry bowls and kale sandwiches you’ll find here, it’s kebabs and hotdogs and pulled pork – all with the absence of meat. Many a meat-eater has dined here and sworn blind they couldn’t tell the difference.SightseeingEven if you’re of the opinion that bus tours are a bit on the touristy side, you can’t deny that they’re an effective way of cramming lots of sights and interesting facts into a limited amount of time: it’s efficient travelling. Liverpool has one very special, very Liverpool and very unique bus tour, though, and that’s the Magical Mystery Tour. The Beatles phenomenon remains a huge draw to the city and we’re all very proud of the four local lads who shook the world. Roll up, roll up for the Mystery Tour, even though it’s not much of a mystery that it’ll take you around all of the famous Beatles landmarks such as Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane. You’ll also get to see some other fantastic Liverpool sights along the way all in a warm, covered, Technicolor tour bus.Around 15 minutes north of the city centre, past the (still very active) docklands you’ll find Crosby beach, which is always full of people, no matter what time of the day or night – iron people to be exact. Anthony Gormley’s Another Place art installation features 100 iron men, all staring out to sea. It was supposed to be a temporary exhibit and move on to New York, but the people of Liverpool took these figures to their hearts and we’ve kept them. The locals make sure the beach is kept clean and tidy it’s our pride and joy. Visit here at sunset for an absolutely breathtaking view.For an architecture hit, stroll through the Georgian Quarter. There’s something about Georgian houses, particularly the windows that do things to me, and here you’ll find gorgeous windows, cobbled streets, ornate front steps and pretty blossom trees. It is without doubt the city’s most photogenic and aesthetically pleasing postcode and it’s perfect for an afternoon stroll. One of the houses on Falkner Street was recently featured on the BBC’s A House Through Time and anyone who’s into period properties and history will be in their element.Liverpool is a city that keeps on surprising you. I’ve only recently discovered the St James Gardens myself. Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral is the largest in the UK and the fifth largest in the world – you can climb the bell tower and take in the famous Liverpool skyline but what I would like to point out is actually ground level. By the main entrance you’ll find a winding path down into the cathedral gardens. Walking through a graveyard might not be for everyone, but there’s a strange sense of peace here. It’s as if the city around you stops existing. This is a wonderful place to catch your breath on your whirlwind tour of Liverpool. Added bonus: you’ll find a natural spring said to have healing properties here.ShoppingLiverpool One is the city’s beating heart of retail. Here you’ll find all your high street stores, restaurant chains and a bustling street scene. You can easily make a day of such retail therapy, grab a cocktail and unwind between stores (one of the real perks of taking the train). You certainly won’t be short of places to exercise that plastic – just don’t be alarmed if you see us Liverpool girls walking round in rollers, it’s just how we get ready for a night out, and here, hair is king. But if you’re after something a bit different, then at the edge of the Baltic Triangle you’ll find the old red-brick Cains Brewery building. It’s now a maze of vintage and antique shops and a recently opened indoor market, which is filled with local independent businesses. It’s quirky heaven – you’ll definitely find some unique souvenirs to take away with you, and maybe even some furniture.Located right next to the world famous Cavern Club is Cavern Walks, a tiny but exclusive shopping mall. This is where our Vivienne Westwood store is and of course, the footballers wives’ favourite, Cricket. You only have to Google Coleen Rooney or Alex Gerrard and one of the first pictures will no doubt be a photo of them swinging a Cricket store bag. If Balenciaga and Givenchy are your poison, then this is worth a swing by.Drinks and nightlifeI wouldn’t say Liverpool was image obsessed, but we appreciate a good aesthetic and we’re not afraid to go the extra mile to make things memorable, especially when it comes to our nightlife. Perhaps that’s why we’re host to The Florist, considered by some to be one of the most Instagramable bars in the UK. You won’t find a prettier place to sip a cocktail. There isn’t a square inch of this place that isn’t covered in some sort of floral arrangement, whether it be neon signs, spray paint or thousands of artificial flowers. Expect your cocktails to be garnished with real flowers (obviously) and make sure to try the hibiscus cooler, you’ll regret it if you don’t.Alma de Cuba, meanwhile, might look like a plain, box-shaped former church on the outside, but on the inside it’s one of the most ornately decorated bars you’ve ever seen and is a Liverpool nightlife institution. Early in the evening it’s a sophisticated cocktail bar and restaurant but as it gets late on a Friday and Saturday night you’ll find yourself caught up in a storm of confetti known as the petal drop then the atmosphere completely changes. The soul of Cuba arrives and you’ll find yourself up on stage burning calories faster than you can consume them with the sexy samba dancers and infectious Latin music.But there’s nothing more alluring than a secret bar and Liverpool has a few – the undisputed pick of the bunch being 81Ltd. Hidden at the top of a darkened staircase, behind a secret door in Salt Dog Slims bar and only accessible by a secret code that changes weekly, you’ll (maybe) find the tiny speakeasy bar, 81Ltd. With a maximum capacity of 60 people, it fills up fast. If you do manage to find it and you do manage to get in, try the Siberian truth serum cocktail.If you sample just one slice of Liverpool’s nightlife while you’re in the city, make it Bongo’s Bingo. These nights always sell out, so this is something you’d have to buy a ticket for in advance, but it is well worth the extra planning. Hosted by Johnny Bongo, this irreverent bingo night is all about the laughs generated by both the host himself and the ridiculous prizes up for grabs – you could be walking away with anything from a box of Coco Pops to a life-size cut out of Philip Schofield. Jeremy Corbyn himself was a recent guest host at Bongo’s Bingo and one lucky lady got to go home with a life-size, autographed cut out of the man himself. Expect plenty of dancing on the tables and glow sticks as well.Liverpool is a 24-hour city, so there’s plenty to keep you entertained until the first train home.

It’s time to go back to the people, 9 January) pinpoints many issues as to why the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, but then perversely creates the wrong solution to the clear and decisive voice of the British people.The dispossessed were given a voice as the sovereignty of parliament was transferred to its citizens via a referendum. The UK has respected every decision of every referendum in the past. Our remain top-heavy parliament is creating difficulties for itself the answer is to listen more carefully to the people and not to ask the people to speak more clearly.Your call for humility on behalf of those who failed to hear the people’s cry is not best displayed by not fulfilling the instructions of those very same people who we recognise have had enough. wants to see a reformed UK in a reformed EU, but it is evident that the EU is not for reforming other than to continue its repetitive march towards the United States of Europe that you say you do not want. The EU is simply not for turning away from closer integration on finances, foreign policy, defence structures and ever closer integration as it engineers the tools that in the end create our ultimate governance from a remote, undemocratic, elitist Brussels. It failed to heed the overtures from David Cameron in 2016, and it is on broadcast mode only as we try to negotiate our withdrawal from its institutions. too is on broadcast mode. We must respect our own tools of democracy, and simply because parliament is in contempt of the people is not sufficient reason to further enrage those who have spoken to ask for greater clarity on what they meant when they said “enough” of this project.Entrepreneur and international hotelier Rocco Forte, writing on the same day in another publication, writes lucidly about the strengths of the UK economy and its significant standing in the world. He is confident about the steps that need to be taken to deliver on the vote and our continued and expansive role with the rest of the world. He points out that the EU sold £341bn of goods to us last year and the leverage that our £95bn deficit with the EU gives us if only we used it.So instead of dressing up our disappointment in the result of the people’s vote of 2016, and pretending that failing to listen to its call is ultimately nothing other than Orwellian doublespeak, let us embrace the opportunities that have been offered by the boldness and astuteness of our ultimate bosses: the people. To deny them their Brexit would certainly be the worst of all worlds and would most certainly put us in uncharted waters – and the repercussions of that would be dire.Nigel Evans MPConservative, Ribble Valley• Your leader makes good points, but is once again based on the assertion, also maintained in the past by the Observer, that the referendum result was valid – “We accepted, without enthusiasm, that leave had won”. Thanks largely to the investigative reporting for which the Scott Trust is revered and supported, we know that a number of factors subverted the referendum. Several of these abuses were claimed, indeed claimed by the perpetrators themselves, to have swung the narrow result the fact that they did so when added together must now be almost certain. At the very least they render the result unsafe as a premise upon which to decide the fate of our nation.Surely the  and the Observer should change their stance on this vital issue in the light of the evidence to which they have themselves contributed with such distinction. Then we will have more hope that our elected representatives will change their stance as well.James WillisAlton, Hampshire• Your editorial on Brexit omits to mention a key factor that is used to argue against a second referendum – that to hold one would disrespect the democratic will of the people. Such a view ignores two glaringly obvious facts. One, the leave majority was extremely slim and therefore cannot be considered to represent a single “will of the people”. Two, democracy was gloriously disrespected by those who made promises that have turned out to be fanciful at best and blatant falsehoods at worst. Now that the people have seen enough evidence upon which to base their rational judgment, their democratic right to express it must be restored.Dr Allan DoddsBramcote, Nottinghamshire• Your leading article supports some mechanism such as that used recently in Ireland. This is potentially crucial for the future of this country in two particular ways. First, it addresses the basic question of who is fitted to guide our country’s policy, and brings in the principle of randomness. Random selection applies no filters: not gender, not race, not education, not class, not wealth, not family connection. It therefore is revolutionary in, at last, assuming equal citizenship. Who owns the country? All its citizenry.Second, the mechanism includes study of the issues. It brings together a number of citizens small enough over a reasonable period of time to become well informed on the principles and technicalities involved. It is not a marketing campaign, but an educational enterprise. I rejoice.Howard HiltonAudlem, Cheshire• Your front page (9 January) carried these messages, in an extract from your editorial: 1) “The message must be that this country needs a new and fairer deal” I believe that is true 2) “and that this is best guaranteed by a better Britain in a better Europe.” I believe that is true 3) “The government has failed” I believe that is true 4) “… so we must go back to the people.” If that means a second referendum, I believe that is not true.The 2016 referendum was ill conceived by a government desperate to dig itself out of a hole, Is that different now? It was badly executed. The wrong question was asked of the wrong electorate at the wrong time. Would that be different now? It was intended as advisory but treated as binding. Is that different now? If you aren’t convinced yet, perhaps you watched the film Brexit which showed an eminently repeatable set of events. So what should happen?I believe that parliament, the ultimate law-making body in the UK, should revoke its article 50 notice, so prematurely sent, and the whole sorry mess would end. Government response to the question “Can article 50 be revoked?” has been: “It’s not government policy”. Presumably that means “yes”. So, that’s what we should do now. And later, when the dust has settled, have a real people’s vote in a general election.Celia WilsonDidcot, Oxfordshire• Your editorial suggests that it is time to take the matter of Brexit out of parliament and back to the people. I agree. However, you appear to avoid calling for the traditional mechanism of a general election and instead suggest a somewhat convoluted process of a citizens’ assembly followed at some point by a reconfigured second referendum. The problem is that if the discussion takes place in the same climate as we currently have, the conclusion is likely to be much the same. That’s why I, and no doubt other  readers, will be gathering at Portland Place in London on Saturday to join the people’s assembly march. It will call for the much-heralded end to austerity to actually happen and challenge the rise of racism. Both of these are essential prerequisites for a more a rational Brexit debate.Keith FlettLondon• The issue should be decided by intelligent, well-informed people from across the political and cultural spectrum of parliament. If their decision reverses Brexit and attracts the ire of vehement Brexiters, so be it.

While, formally, the EU withdrawal act gave the government 21 days to return to the Commons if the vote were lost – to set out what it plans to do next – there would have been intense political pressure to do so sooner.May had already reassured cabinet ministers that she would act more swiftly than that, and a government spokesman said on Wednesday: “We would seek to provide certainty, quickly.”Grieve’s amendment gives the UK prime minister a hard deadline, and underlines rebel backbenchers’ determination to use every tactic at their disposal to bind her hands.But almost as significant was the row that led to its passage, with the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, facing down his own clerks, May’s chief whip and the leader of the House of Commons, , and insisting Grieve’s amendment could be voted on.One pro-EU Tory said of Bercow: “He was brilliant today, utterly brilliant.”The government fears it sets a precedent by jeopardising a key power – the ability to decide on the business of the House of Commons. With backbenchers conducting a guerrilla campaign against a no-deal Brexit, that is the last thing Downing Street needs.For May, who sat implacable on the frontbench on Wednesday as the row raged around her, it was yet another heavy blow to her dented authority. But the prime minister made another significant concession, in an attempt to win over some leavers.The Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, said the government would accept an amendment tabled by the Tory MP Hugo Swire. Among other things, if the future relationship with the EU were not negotiated by mid-2020, it would give MPs the chance to choose between extending the transition period and entering the Irish backstop.The mooted extension to the transition period is a new idea being put forward by the EU to help Theresa May square the circle created by the written agreement last December and the draft withdrawal agreement in March.\u0026nbspThat committed the UK and the EU to ensuring there was no ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspBut it also, after an intervention by the Democratic Unionist party, committed the UK (not the EU) not to have any trading differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.\u0026nbspThe problem is that these are two irreconcilable agreements. They also impinge on the legally binding Good Friday agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland and in some senses pooled sovereignty of Northern Ireland giving people a birthright to be Irish or British or both.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU along with the customs union and the single market then the border in Ireland becomes the only land border between the UK and the EU forcing customs, tax and regulatory controls.\u0026nbspThe backstop is one of three options agreed by the EU and the UK in December and would only come into play if option A (overall agreement) or option B (a tailor-made solution) cannot be agreed by the end of transition. The Irish have likened it to an insurance policy.\u0026nbspThe new EU idea is to extend the transition period to allow time to get to option A or B.\u0026nbspBut an extension is problematic for Brexiters and leave voters, who want the UK to get out of the EU as soon as possible.\u0026nbspThe Irish and the EU will also still need the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, which must be signed before the business of the trade deal can get under way. Otherwise it is\u0026nbsp a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspExtending the transition into 2021 would mean another year of paying into the EU budget. Britain would have to negotiate this but it has been estimated at anywhere between £10bn and £17bn.\u0026nbspStaying in the EU for another year would also mean continued freedom of movement and being under the\u0026nbspEuropean court of justice, which Brexiters would oppose.\u0026nbspDowning Street is also expecting some assurances from the EU27 between now and the moment of truth next Tuesday, though not the overhaul of the legally binding withdrawal agreement the Democratic Unionist party had demanded.Ultimately, though, few at Westminster believe May’s earlier tactic of sending MPs off home for Christmas to calm down and think about their responsibility to deliver on the referendum, had altered the dynamic in this deeply ided parliament.And as the fraught discussions at cabinet on Tuesday underlined, there are scant few options available if the vote is lost, and none of them look appealing.May could make another mad dash to Brussels give MPs the opportunity to vote on a series of alternative Brexit options (which Tory whips believe might focus minds on the lack of a majority for any alternative to their deal) announce that she plans to leave without a deal or even press the nuclear button and promise a general election.Whatever she does she will almost certainly face a full-blown vote of no confidence from Jeremy Corbyn within days or even hours of the vote next Tuesday.Before the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, losing a vote on the finance bill on one day and another less than 24 hours later would have most likely proved fatal to a government’s authority.But opposition parties now need to win a formal vote of no confidence and it is unclear whether either the DUP or Tory rebels hate the deal enough to want to tear down the government.May cannot now be unseated by Tory MPs, who tried the no confidence gambit before Christmas and failed, and her cabinet is bitterly ided about the way forward.Some Tory colleagues believe the prime minister’s fabled resilience is such that she could try to keep putting her much maligned deal to MPs, grimly pressing home the fact that, as she repeatedly said on Wednesday, “the only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal”.Whichever path she chooses, more dramatic clashes with parliament lie ahead within a matter of days, however calm the chatter over the canapes at No 10."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ae1c7898121f344a4740a39cf40779b3ebfd88/0_201_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab31f28b55c4d1202bd047c1606cd5f","title":"tory brexiters calling for his head john bercow in his element","story":"Conservatives have been spitting blood over Speaker’s decision to allow Grieve amendmentSeven former Speakers of the House of Commons have been executed. To judge by the looks on the faces of many on the government benches, John Bercow came dangerously close to becoming the eighth. For well over an hour of points of order that came dangerously close to outright entropy, Tory MPs were spitting blood about the Speaker’s decision to allow an amendment by the Conservative Dominic Grieve to force the government to have a vote on a Brexit plan B within three days if its plan A was rejected next Tuesday.Cue absolute scenes. Constitutional outrage, yelled many MPs, working themselves up into an unpleasant shade of purple. A curious description of what appeared to most normal people as a relatively minor disagreement over parliamentary procedures. The cartoon Brexiter Mark Francois was particularly apoplectic. It was all a stitch-up. Bercow was a remainer to his core and he had only granted the amendment in the hope of making a no deal less likely.Bercow was in his element, becoming ever more pompous and self-important in his mannerisms. Francois had been right to say that the original motion said no motion could be moved other than by a minister of the crown, but this was an amendment that didn’t need to be debated. So tough. If the Commons didn’t like the amendment then it could always vote it down. Not that it would, because Bercow wasn’t stupid enough to select a contentious amendment that wouldn’t get passed. The government’s real problem wasn’t the amendment it was its lack of a majority.“This is just sophistry,” huffed Francois. It was nothing more than a total abuse of all that was good and pure about Commons procedure. Bercow beamed. The session was going even better than he had dared hope. There was nothing he liked more than being the centre of attention. This was to be the day when he extended his powers a little further.Labour MPs weren’t slow to come up with points of order of their own. Either to congratulate the Speaker for his singular display of judgment and brilliance or to observe that it was a sweet irony that many Tories, who had made taking back control of the sovereignty of the British parliament the defining slogan of the leave campaign, were now so upset that the legislature was being handed greater control over the executive.Be careful what you wish for. A few assorted opposition MPs were so mesmerised by proceedings that all they could do was stand up, make points of order demanding other people would stop standing up to make points of order so the Commons could get on with its business. Much more of this and we’d have disappeared through the looking glass. Not so much about taking back control as needing to get a sodding grip.While all this was going on, the chief whip, Julian Smith, was busy punching texts into his phone and wondering what on earth he had done in a previous life to deserve his current one. He had lost a vote yesterday and he was now certain to lose another one today. He would also lose the Brexit vote next Tuesday and now the one the following week. Not least because there was no plan B to have a vote on. Come to think of it, there was barely a plan A. Whips were supposed to win votes, not lose them. He was becoming the Thinking Man’s Chris Grayling.“Just do something,” he hissed to Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the house. Leadsom obliged by asking Bercow if he had consulted the clerks and, if so, whether they had agreed with his judgment. The Speaker confirmed he had consulted them but refused to ulge the contents of their conversation.Then would he care to publish the clerk’s advice, Leadsom enquired, nudging the irony meters even further into the red as the government had spent the last two years trying to prevent details of any of its Brexit analysis and negotiations from being made public. Bercow beamed. If it was all the same to the house, he’d rather keep his discussions private.He shrugged. He knew he was winging it a bit, but what the hell? He was on a roll and he’d got away with it so far. What was the purpose of precedent, if not to be broken from time to time? Hell, if everything had stayed the same since the middle ages, he’d have been a dead man long ago. And if he could do his bit to save the country from a no-deal Brexit then so much the better.On and on it went. Jacob Rees-Mogg made a point that was only intelligible to him and was almost certainly incorrect, while Crispin Blunt accused Bercow of outright bias and urged him to stand down. No chance. Bercow had the numbers as the vote on the amendment would prove."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fed0515c4ac6f7332be02d34c930700045a43c2/0_355_3590_2154/master/3590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=183fd181201927922c8eb2c8a325e974","title":"what is a citizens assembly brexit explainer","story":"Calls are growing to convene a citizens’ assembly on Brexit. Here’s what you need to know Several influential groups and figures have suggested adopting a form of citizens’ assembly, as used in the Irish referendum debate, to find a way to break the Brexit impasse.In an editorial on Wednesday, the  backed the idea. Here we take a look at what a citizen’s assembly would entail.A citizens’ assembly is a group of people brought together to discuss an issue or issues, and reach a conclusion about what they think should happen, according to the definition put forward by the House of Commons library.Citizens’ assemblies give members of the public the time and opportunity to learn about and discuss a topic, before reaching conclusions, it says. Assembly members are asked to make trade-offs and arrive at workable recommendations.Facilitated by experts and combining small-group discussions with large-scale debates and a series of votes, members meet over a series of weekends with the goal of removing the conflicts of interest and tribal loyalties that can hamper politicians in reaching a conclusion.A cross-section of the public is employed to study the options available to the state on certain questions and propose answers through rational and reasoned discussion and the use of various methods of inquiry, such as directly questioning experts. In many cases, the state will require the proposals to be accepted through a referendum before becoming law.The people who take part are chosen randomly so they reflect the wider population in terms of demographics – age, gender, ethnicity and social class.The number of members involved can vary. A recent citizens’ assembly, formed to examine social care provision in England, had 47 members who were English citizens and eligible to vote in UK general elections.Citizens’ assemblies, and other similar methods, have been used in the UK and other countries, including Australia, Canada and the US, to address a range of complex issues.One of the most prominent to take place in recent years was the assembly established by the Irish parliament to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue. A panel of 99 people, after convening in a Dublin hotel over a series of weekends, then made recommendations on the legislation that would be laid down by the Dáil if the referendum was carried. In a reverse of the sequence in the UK, the public knew that they were voting on legislation before the Dáil, providing for abortion on request up to the 12th week of pregnancy.In its editorial, the  argues that in order to break the current Brexit gridlock, MPs should open up the debate to the country by establishing a citizens’ assembly to examine the options and issues that face the nation.After this, it says, parliament should have the right, if it so chooses, to put these alternatives to the public in a referendum this year or next.Last month, the campaign group Compass was among the signatories to a letter calling for a citizens’ assembly on Brexit. It wants an assembly to be set up where 500 members of the public, picked at random, would hear evidence on Brexit.Neal Lawson, the chair of Compass, said: “Parliament is fast reaching an impasse. It is time to hand the decision over to a deliberative panel of citizens to decide the best way forward for the country.”Other signatories to the letter included the Blur frontman Damon Albarn, the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the bishop of Leeds, Nick Baines, the Labour peer Ruth Lister, the novelists Jonathan Coe and Ian McEwan, and Alexandra Runswick from the pressure group Unlock Democracy. The Labour MP Stella Creasy has also backed the idea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a11988e8753bcf7d626184a6936d62898d0bd40e/0_26_1022_613/master/1022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=558e6d875499e8f7a3021780e2f08154","title":"repeating fast radio bursts from deep space could be aliens","story":"Repeating bursts of radio waves detected for first time since initial accidental discovery in 2007Astronomers have detected mysterious, ultra-brief repeating energy bursts from deep space for only the second time in history, and some experts suggested they could be evidence of advanced alien life.The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs), millisecond-long pulses of radio waves, is unknown, but most scientists say they are generated by powerful astrophysical phenomena emanating from billions of light years outside our galaxy, the Milky Way – such as black holes or super-dense neutron stars merging together.Some, however, including Prof Avi Loeb, from the Harvard-Smithsonian centre for astrophysics, have posited more outlandish theories, suggesting they could be evidence of incredibly advanced alien technology.The new discovery, made by a Canadian-led team of astronomers searching for FRBs, was published in the journal Nature following a three-week period last summer during which the group detected 13 of the flashes using a new type of radio telescope, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (Chime), in British Columbia’s Okanagan Valley.For only the second time ever, ning more than 60 FRBs recorded to date, one of the FRBs was detected repeating. The Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico previously observed such repeating bursts in 2015, after FRBs were first detected by accident in 2007 when a burst was spotted in radio astronomy data that had been collected in 2001. It is likely that many more FRBs with even lower frequencies often travel past our planet, and with technological advances we might be able to detect more of them.“Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB,” said a Chime astrophysicist, Dr Ingrid Stairs, from the University of British Columbia. “Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles – where they’re from and what causes them.”The majority of the 13 FRBs showed signs of “scattering”, suggesting their sources could be powerful astrophysical objects in locations with special characteristics, the scientists said.“That could mean in some sort of dense clump like a supernova remnant or near the central black hole in a galaxy,” said Dr Cherry Ng, a team member in the study from the University of Toronto. “But it has to be in some special place to give us all the scattering that we see.”The new FRBs were recorded at unusually low radio frequencies. Most of those previously detected have had frequencies of around 1,400 megahertz (MHz), but the new ones fell within a range below 800 MHz. Seven of the new bursts registered at 400 MHz – the lowest frequency the Chime telescope can detect.In 2017 Loeb and his Harvard colleague Manasvi Lingam proposed that FRBs could be leakage from planet-sized alien transmitters. Rather than being designed for communication, they would more likely be used to propel giant spaceships powered by light sails which bounce light, or in this case radio beams, off a huge reflective sheet to provide thrust, the scientists said.“Fast radio bursts are exceedingly bright given their short duration and origin at great distances, and we haven’t identified a possible natural source with any confidence,” said Loeb in a statement after the publication of a previous paper in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. “An artificial origin is worth contemplating and checking.“Science isn’t a matter of belief, it’s a matter of evidence. Deciding what’s likely ahead of time limits the possibilities. It’s worth putting ideas out there and letting the data be the judge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a54a6a6083d12f24073ce1036746c258dd688bdb/0_132_5302_3181/master/5302.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=612c46cf71e78e974e69c60262a1dd30","title":"hubble loses best camera but discovers brightest ever quasar","story":"Nasa working on fix after space telescope’s wide-field camera broke downThe Hubble space telescope is operating without its best camera after a hardware problem forced it to shut down.Nasa said the camera stopped working on Tuesday but three other science instruments were still operating and able to continue celestial observations.The news came as it emerged that Hubble has discovered the brightest quasar ever seen in the early universe, with the brightness of about 600 trillion suns.The newly discovered quasar, catalogued as J043947.08+163415.7, is so old that the light from it started its journey when the universe was only about a billion years old. There are hopes it could provide an insight into the birth of galaxies.A quasar is the extremely bright nucleus of an active galaxy and its powerful glow is created by the incredible amounts of energy released by gas falling towards the supermassive black hole at its centre.Tuesday’s hardware failure happened in the telescope’s wide-field camera, which was installed by spacewalking astronauts in 2009. The camera has backup electronics that can be called into action if necessary, according to Nasa.The camera has captured stunning images of stars, galaxies stretching far back in time and assisted in deep sky surveys. It has also studied objects in the solar system, discovering some of the tiny moons around Pluto, as well as a 14th moon around Neptune. It takes pictures in both visible and ultraviolet light, as well as near-infrared.Orbiting 350 miles (560km) above Earth, Hubble was launched in 1990 and visited by space shuttle astronauts for repairs and upgrades five times.It recently stopped working altogether for three weeks because of a problem with its gyroscopes.This is the first time the camera has acted up like this, said Cheryl Gundy, a spokeswoman with the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which handles science operations for the telescope.“Nasa is trying to pull together the team to try to diagnose the issue,” Gundy said.“We would like to have Hubble back up and working as quickly as possible, and Nasa is making that happen,” even with the partial government shutdown, she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44123dff3752521039b5bc7362ee1238fbc7eabb/0_39_3238_1942/master/3238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67b34d036608e5f8051574210a69fbf2","title":"appoint minister for hunger to tackle uk food insecurity mps urge","story":"Nearly 2 million Britons may be undernourished and one in five children are in food insecurity, committee toldMPs are urging the government to appoint a minister for hunger in the UK to tackle the growing problem of food insecurity, which is affecting one in five children.The Commons environmental audit committee has accused the government of “turning a blind eye” to hunger and criticised ministers for treating hunger as an “overseas” issue, despite evidence that the UK has among the worst levels of food insecurity in Europe.It calls on the government to appoint a minister with accountability for tackling hunger in the UK. “Despite the need for joined-up cross-government action, hunger and food insecurity has fallen between the cracks in government plans,” it says.“We are concerned at the government’s turning a blind eye to UK hunger and its lack of progress in measuring and acting upon hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition in the UK.”The report cites a defence of universal credit by the junior work and pensions minister Justin Tomlinson, who says the new benefit offers “personalised, tailored support, helping get the money to the most vulnerable people in society, which then leads into tackling the issue of food insecurity”.The report is withering in its response: “We find the minister’s optimism about the universal credit system to be misguided and ill-judged.”The UK is a signatory to the UN Sustainable Development Goals agenda, adopted in 2015, which aims to end hunger and ensure access to safe and nutritious food. The agenda applies to developed and developing countries alike. MPs say the government is failing to meet its international commitments.Meanwhile, the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI) has added its voice to the call for government action to tackle food insecurity. A survey of more than 4,000 women’s institute volunteers said more than two-thirds had donated to food banks and community food aid projects in the past month.Ann Jones, the vice-chair of the NFWI and chair of its public affairs committee, said: “Historically, the WI was at the frontline of supplying food to a country ravaged by war but today it is clear that WI members are battling to tackle food insecurity on a very different front – via donations to food banks and soup kitchens.“Food poverty is a very real issue, and we have found from our survey that WI members are taking the initiative and donating to food banks and other organisations in their communities. Whilst it is heartening to see the public stepping in like this, this is really just a sticking plaster and there is only so much that can be expected from civil society.”A government spokesperson said: “Household incomes have never been higher and the number of children living in workless households is at a record low, but we know there’s more to do to ensure that every family has access to nutritious, healthy food.”Child Poverty Action Group’s chief executive, Alison Garnham, said: “We already have a minister responsible for our social security system which, on any basic understanding of its role, is meant to prevent poverty, destitution and hunger in this country. That we should need reminding of the UN’s sustainable development goals in such a rich country is a scandalous development.”Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation thinktank, said: “The EAC is right to state the urgency of a comprehensive national response to household food insecurity in the UK. We need an approach that considers the shared causes and consequences of food insecurity, hunger, malnutrition and obesity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e077035ef08b96c37c38cd5f86dadb938a2d8c/0_39_4867_2920/master/4867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2543ab135124e7aebc742c3078d648f5","title":"ashley giles new england cricket director ecb","story":"On being sacked as the England limited overs coach in 2014, Ashley Giles told his wife, Stine, he would one day return. Just under five years later he has come good on that promise, with the once-dubbed King of Spain making a regal return as the director of England cricket.At Lord’s on Wednesday, following a brief introduction from the England and Wales Cricket Board’s lesser-spotted chief executive, Tom Harrison, Giles set out his intentions for the role, one which has come not at a time of crisis – as can often be the case for new supremos – but rather at the start of a year which brings with it two golden opportunities.The to-do list is not sparse for Giles, especially given a new coach – or possibly coaches – must be hired by the end of the 2019 season after Trevor Bayliss moves on. He must also manage England’s centrally contracted players and support staff, and oversee the pathways, Loughborough and boost county relationships, all with a budget that has been trimmed to service the looming 100-ball tournament.But with Eoin Morgan’s No 1-ranked one-day team favourites for the summer’s home World Cup, and Joe Root’s emerging Test side looking to regain the Ashes from an Australia team who are currently making the Conservative Party look cohesive, it is a case of augmenting the work of his predecessor, Andrew Strauss (who had to step down for family reasons), rather than initiating an overhaul.“I certainly don’t think there’s a need to come in like a bull in a china shop,” said Giles, before praising the work of Strauss. “I have to support the coaches and players and make sure there’s nothing down the line that will interfere with the direction we’re going in. There’s no guarantee that we will win the World Cup or the Ashes but my role is to give us the best possible chance. But there’s a balance between short term and looking down the line.”That balance is something the 45-year-old admits he got wrong when previously with England. Having spent 18 months as one-day coach to the more powerful Test team director, Andy Flower, the Ashes whitewash in Australia and a shock defeat to the Netherlands in the 2014 World T20 prompted Paul Downton, then in Giles’s current role, to stand him down and unify the roles.Having gone away and bulked up his CV at Lancashire and Warwickshire – as well as undertaken a masters in sports directorship at Manchester Met – his experience has not put Giles off splitting the coaches by way of format once more.With a World Test Championship starting – the Ashes will be its first series – and back-to-back Twenty20 World Cups in 2020 and 2021, there will be few fixtures of reduced importance and thus it brings a sardine tin of a schedule.“We’ll look at everything,” Giles replied, when asked if two coaches is the way forward. “The benefits of two coaches are clearly the workload, enabling people to focus on one form. When we first split it, Andy and me, we thought the paths of players might go similarly. But they have actually come together more – we have players who are adaptable.“The other bit to consider is team culture – with different leaders you have different cultures. That was certainly the case with me and Andy. It doesn’t make either wrong, we are just different people, so lead differently. And if you have different leaders but the same players in the room, that can have its own challenge.”Until that decision, Giles said he must ensure nothing “derails” two well-functioning teams. Though relatively minor, his own belief that the popular football warm-ups are not worth the risk – see Jonny Bairstow’s twisted ankle in Sri Lanka last October – will not force a change of policy right away.“I don’t want to be blamed for losing the World Cup because we are not playing football,” Giles said. “If you look at what football does, the benefits from a psychological and fun point of view are outstripped by the dangers. But we will discuss that. I am not coming in with an iron rod right now.The midnight curfew for players post the 2017 Bristol incident and some Ashes misdemeanours also looks set to remain. “I don’t think we should look at curfews as being a negative thing,” Giles said. “We have got a responsibility to protect our players a duty of care to them. And the discipline side of things is really important to me.“Not everyone will like the way I manage but you can’t please everyone. Some guys will have enjoyed the way I manage but you have to have difficult conversations with people at times. That’s something I’ve never been afraid of. And I’m aware that at times that’s cost me relationships. But my responsibility is to the teams, to England, to make sure we are successful and going the right way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/269552ef03b6ee7ba7e71b1d36410dec4bdee7f3/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=994f1fb3d525a3fd1675ad5107167440","title":"australian open 2019 british murray edmund konta tennis","story":"There are fitness and form doubts over Britain’s leading men, while Johanna Konta is looking to rediscover the magic of 2017Uncertainty hangs over the former world No 1, who has struggled to return to his physical peak after hip surgery. These are difficult times for Murray and although the five-times Australian Open finalist could be a dangerous first‑round opponent for a seeded player, it was troubling to hear him express concerns over his future after losing to Daniil Medvedev in Brisbane last week. It remains to be seen how far he can push his body over the course of five sets.Murray’s fitness problems have increased the pressure on Edmund and the British No 1 will be under the microscope after his stirring run to last year’s semi-finals. Dealing with heightened expectations will not be easy for this shy young man. However Edmund has made smooth progress under his Swedish coach, Fredrik Rosengren, and his devastating forehand will give him a chance against anyone. It would be unwise to read too much into a rusty defeat to Yasutaka Uchiyama, the world No 163, in Brisbane.The left-hander is looking to maintain his progress after breaking into the top 100.

Last season was difficult for Konta, who must prove that she was no flash in the pan. Konta has a new coach, the Frenchman Dimitri Zavialoff, and the 2016 Australian Open semi-finalist was feeling good about her game after beating Sloane Stephens in Brisbane. However, her withdrawal from the Sydney Open was a concern.Watson has made it out of the first round in Melbourne on only two occasions and her recent grand slam form does not inspire confidence. The 26-year-old has also had a sticky start to the year, losing to Marta Kostyuk in qualifying for Brisbane and Irina-Camelia Begu in the first round at Hobart. The player who almost stunned Serena Williams at Wimbledon four years ago is rarely seen these days.Boulter’s first task this year is to hold on to her place in the top 100. That will provide her with a solid platform to keep improving. Boulter has already had a taste of grand slam action, beating Verónica Cepede Royg before losing to Naomi Osaka at Wimbledon last year, and she will savour her first appearance in the main draw at the Australian Open.A talent that promised so much has rather fizzled out in the past 18 months. Evans seemed to be on to a good thing when he reached the fourth round of the Australian Open in 2017, only for his career to hit a dead end when he received a one‑year ban after testing positive for cocaine. Evans, who returned to the tour last April, now has a chance of redemption.Injuries have stopped Ward from making the most of his early potential and the suspicion is that his best years are behind him. He barely played a match of any note in 2018 and has not featured in a grand slam since a first-round defeat to Marcos Baghdatis 18 months ago.Ward battled back from a set down to defeat home favourite Maverick Banes in the first round of qualifying which set up a meeting in the next stage with Argentinian Marco Trungelliti.Qualifying for Brisbane at the expense of Andrea Petkovic was a good way for the Londoner to start her season, even if she followed it up with a heavy defeat to Anastasija Sevastova. Dart will need more of that fearlessness after qualifying for the main draw in Melbourne for the first time and beating France’s Chloe Paquet in the first qualifying round. No doubt she will draw on the experience of earning a Wimbledon wild card and playing well in a first-round defeat to Karolina Pliskova last year.

Allowing retrospective reporting of alleged approaches to engage in corrupt conduct will assist in our ongoing and wide-ranging investigations, as well as enabling us to continue to develop a comprehensive picture of the situation there.“If any player or participant has any information concerning corrupt conduct they should come forward and share it with us now without fear of any repercussions.“We would urge any participant with any information that may demonstrate corrupt conduct affecting cricket in Sri Lanka to come forward in the strictest of confidence.”The move comes after the Sri Lanka sports minister, Harin Fernando, recently disclosed that during a meeting with the ICC in Dubai he was informed that the country is considered the most corrupt in world cricket, with links to the criminal underworld throughout.Three former Sri Lanka internationals – Sanath Jayasuriya, Nuwan Zoysa and Dilhara Lokuhettige – have been charged with different offences in the past few months in what are understood to be separate ICC investigations.Jayasuriya, who was previously the chairman of selectors, has been charged with failure to cooperate with the ICC – chiefly a refusal to pass on electronic devices – while Zoysa and Lokuhetti are alleged to have approached players to fix matches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed6ea47838353c0c02a451c5bbfe7dc47e6bae99/0_337_3576_2146/master/3576.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5012a7e013ae9c00b3e936268537f83e","title":"sindhu vee sandhog review soho theatre","story":"Soho theatre, LondonThe standup’s debut show insightfully dissects the travails of long-term commitment and the tsunami of having childrenSindhu Vee has a more interesting hinterland than most debut standups. She’s an ex-banker, has been married for 20 years and has three children. In her maiden solo set, she ignores the world of finance – saving it for a future show, perhaps? – and talks exclusively about things domestic. Sandhog is her treatise on long-term marriage, asking: How do you make it last? What’s love got to do with it? And, most importantly – with frequent reference to Vee’s battle of wits with her Danish husband – who wins?The cliches don’t detain us long. There are throwaway mother-in-law gags, and a routine about farting in bed as a relationship landmark. A snippet of humdrum domestic conversation brings to mind Bridget Christie’s funnier and more extreme take on similar bland exchanges. Like many minority ethnic comics before her, Vee jokes about parental discipline, citing her Indian mum’s no-nonsense approach. Once choice gag finds Vee’s son calling her “intrusive”. Her response – and the withering look that accompanies it – makes mincemeat of the complaint.Winning such arguments, according to Vee, is what family life is all about. I wasn’t persuaded by that: her smugness feels forced. But there’s hard-won authenticity elsewhere, in the contrast drawn between getting and staying married, the riff on love in a decades-long relationship (“so much of this feels like hate”), and her routine in which she proposes that “kids are to marriage as tsunamis are to beach holidays”. It’s an engaging debut, in which our ex-banker host measures out the profits and losses of domestic commitment, and finds herself just about in the black.• At Soho theatre, London, until 19 January and from 6 to 16 May.

What a rare and precious joyAfter carrying the weight of the world, and Jimmy McGovern’s newest locus of social fury, on her shoulders in the remorselessly brutal, brilliant Care last month, Sheridan Smith rewards us and herself with Cleaning Up (ITV), a six-part series pitched somewhere between a romp and a soap, and pairing very nicely with a large gin and tonic.At first, I assumed it was based on a true story, this tale of a cleaner at a financial firm who discovers there is money to be made from the information she – as one of the army of invisibles on whom the smooth, hygienic running of the firm depends – has inadvertent access to. I assumed this because, ever since I did some temping at 18, I have been astonished it doesn’t happen every day. Employers really do not see you. Many is the time I photocopied confidential documents, updated spreadsheets, logged into a computer that held a wealth of corporate secrets in order to update someone’s diary or otherwise laid eyes on information that could have changed my life if only I’d had the sense to know what to do with it, and the balls to try.Sam (Smith), fortunately, has both. She is a harassed! But loving! But cash-strapped! But good-hearted! But gambling app-addicted and debt-ridden! But hardworking! single mother of two girls, the elder of whom – Alice – has a chance at getting into “one of the top dance schools in the country!” with all the expense that will entail. She and her husband split up over her gambling and debt-accrual, plus his penchant for banging his massage therapist, and he is now seeking custody of the kids on the grounds that Sam will probably try to sell their hair for another spin on the cyber-roulette wheel.If only she could catch a break! Wait – what’s this? A financier staying late at the office discussing, on the phone, an illegal transaction that he would get seven years in prison for if caught? Using the initiative that has previously seen her disguise stubborn carpet stains with permanent marker, surreptitiously replace another client’s eco-cleaning liquid nonsense with proper bleach and lie convincingly to the loan shark who is bothering her, Sam scribbles down the salient points, Googles “insider trading” then hightails it to the library to borrow Investing for Dummies and learn how to open an account with a broker. One corralling of a best friend (Jade Anouka) with a serendipitous inheritance and nothing – apart from, uh, that – to lose, one lodger who knows how to fix the busted listening device Sam buys on eBay to place in the air vent above the insider trader’s office, and they are serendipitously away. Hurrah!By the end of the first episode, they are £250 to the good, the girls still have their hair and, more importantly, everyone has managed to keep a straight face. Maybe Alice will even get to go to one of the top dance schools in the country, if that pesky boyfriend and resentment of the compromises necessitated by her hardworking, good-hearted but debt-ridden mother’s situation don’t sabotage her future! There are some things money can’t protect you from, I suspect. In the end, B-plots can teach you some profound emotional truths under the jazz-handsing, y’know?There is not quite enough story – there’s a lot of Sam staring into mirrors as she cleans them, and it takes her and Jess for ever in TV terms to do very little preparation for their sort-of heist, when it could have borne a much greater weight of fun-and-not-wholly-plausible-IRL detail, in accordance with the long-proved truism that the viewing public loves “how-tos” – but, overall, this is the kind of solid, well-made nonsense that is such a rare and precious joy. Indispensable to it are the actors, who throw themselves uncynically into it with their whole hearts. This is always Smith’s greatest gift, and here she is surrounded by a supporting cast doing likewise.We leave Sam and Jess celebrating their ill-gotten, but morally justifiable (“They’re just a bunch of rich guys getting paid to move even richer guys’ money about! Why should these greedy bastards cut corners and get away with it?”), gains as, back in the office, the listening device’s wires start tapping on the side of the vent as the air blows through, and the trader looks up in annoyance. Tune in next week when more things will happen in a fun, but unchallenging, manner! Stocks are up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f68dc609f1145fc80679a72cd2407acf03575cc/0_148_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016978594d3a1e76ff622758a11358ca","title":"matteo salvini says italy and poland could build new europe","story":"Italy’s interior minister strives to forge far-right alliances before European elections in MayItaly’s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has said that Italy and Poland could trigger a “European spring” that could break the dominant “Germany-France axis” as he strives to forge far-right alliances before the European parliamentary elections in May.Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League, travelled to Poland on Wednesday for strategy meetings with members of the ruling Law and Justice party. The two parties share similar anti-immigration, anti-Muslim and Eurosceptic views.He said during a press conference with the Polish interior minister, Joachim Brudziński, that the Europe that could emerge after the elections could bring about a “renaissance of European values” and “lead us away from the one that is run by bureaucrats”.Brudziński praised Salvini’s hardline immigration strategy, which has included closing off Italian ports to migrant boats, adding that the two countries shared common goals such as “strengthening borders” and helping to improve conditions in migrants’ home countries.Salvini first mooted the idea of a pan-European network of nationalist parties weeks after forming a coalition government with former arch rival, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), last June.He has already forged a partnership with the French far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, with the pair saying during a press conference in Rome in October that the EU elections would usher in a new era of “common sense” as nationalist parties rally to restore values, pride and dignity for ordinary workers.At the same time, Salvini’s coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, announced that he was preparing an election manifesto with European populist groups that are in coherence with his M5S. He held a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday with Paweł Kukiz, a former rock star who heads up Poland’s Kukiz’15 Ivan Sincic, of Croatia’s Living Wall and Karolina Kähönen, the co-founder of Liike Nyt, which describes itself as a liberal political movement in Finland.“They are young but they have an ever-increasing consensus,” Di Maio wrote on Facebook. “They are the coolest and most beautiful energies in Europe. Our dream is a Europe with more social rights, more innovation and less privileges. A Europe that puts the needs of its citizens first.”Di Maio also sparked a row with France earlier this week after urging the yellow vests, who have held several violent anti-government protests since early December, to “not give up”. He said the protests reminded him of the spirit that gave birth to the M5S and he is planning to meet yellow vest activists over the next few days.“Salvini has the same slogans as the rightwing parties in Europe but essentially different strategies, so I wonder if they would be truly powerful in a new EU parliament,” said Mattia Diletti, a politics professor at Rome’s Sapienza University.“As for M5S, Di Maio knows that by saying something sympathetic about the yellow vests, they are trying to boost popularity by reminding people that ‘we were revolutionary too’. But he’s being naive – he’s interfering in French politics and is not considering how a minister should be within a European context.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e6d5557f698f05a8783e2679858df54a16ba6bc/0_131_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc81c0db2991bcc0f017133c2cf4b0f2","title":"post metoo have the likes of kevin hart and aziz ansari learned from their mistakes","story":"Can we expect a new era of equality?

Your optimism is beautiful, shining like a beacon in the apocalyptic wasteland of cynicism in which we now find ourselves. Sadly, snuff it out I must. It was all terribly exciting this time last year, as we watched powerful people being called out for behaviours that had always been wrong but – for reasons no one can explain now – they had been able to get away with until literally last year. Sexism, racism, harassment and even flat-out rape: they were all denounced, as previously marginalised, or at least less powerful, people finally took a stand against powerful men, and – more importantly – they were believed. Even if we didn’t win all the fights, even if Brett “I didn’t write: ‘Sexually assault someone’ on my calendar case closed!” Kavanaugh is, incredibly, on the supreme court, despite Christine Blasey-Ford’s powerful testimony that he assaulted her as a teenager, it still felt like a watershed had been reached. Truly, we thought, men had learned their lesson. Oh, brave new dawn of sexual equality!Aaaand – as they say in the movies – scene. The sequel rarely lives up to the original because there is always a sense of anticlimax seeing what happens after the original’s euphoric ending scene. And what is happening here is a definite letdown. It turns out that the men have not learned their lesson. No, in fact, they think they have been wronged. Because nothing is more unfair than being called on out on your behaviour, it seems.Hart is not alone in his resistance to self-examination. Aziz Ansari is back doing standup almost a year after he was accused by a woman of … well, let’s just call it “less than ideal behaviour on a date”, note that he was “surprised and concerned” by her account and get to the matter at hand. Once Ansari styled himself as Mr Woke, writing a book called Modern Romance, wearing Time’s Up pins to red-carpet events and so on. But according to the New York Times, his latest show’s theme is “contempt for people trying to outwoke each other”. Ah, how fast the woke turn when wokeness turns against them!The same could be said of Louis CK. Once, he did brilliant routines about how men were so dangerous to women that a woman agreeing to date with one was like him having to agree to a date with “a half-bear and half-lion and thinking: ‘I hope this one’s nice!’” Alas, it has since been revealed he is less than nice, having admitted – after years of denials – to masturbating in front of horrified women. A clip of his latest routine was recently leaked in which he mocked, of all people, the survivors of the Parkland shooting, confirming that CK hasn’t quite grasped who’s who in the whole predator-victim nexus.Now, no one can dictate how someone should react to being publicly shamed and vilified. But it would be nice if at least some of these men could spend, I don’t know, two minutes examining their culpability, instead of running away from such reflections in terror and lashing out at the world, like a toddler who can’t deal with being told off for being mean to his baby sister so he hits his mother. I don’t ask for much, guys. But I will ask for adult men to be better than toddlers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1362a73daa1cd2ebfae3032bb40b3ce20d2c0b/0_23_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14a06aaa76893672f30e0220e8c04d0","title":"what does 2019 hold for kim jong un and north korea podcast","story":"Kim Jong-un goes into 2019 with momentum to build on after last year’s historic meeting with President Donald Trump.

Photograph: TCDFor hundreds of years, Trinity College Dublin has appeared to many Dubliners as an imposing, high-walled institution they dared not enter.“I’ve spoken to people who’ve lived and worked in the capital their whole lives,” says Prof Veronica Campbell, Trinity’s bursar. “Often, their first time in Trinity may not occur until they are in their 40s or 50s.”This may be about to change. A plan to modernise Ireland’s oldest university envisages opening up the campus with a series of new pedestrian entrances and forging closer links with the city around it.There will also be a series of landmark buildings – some currently under construction – aimed at modernising ageing facilities and breathing new life into neglected streetscapes.At the same time, there is the challenge of preserving the 426-year-old university’s historic buildings, plonked right in the heart of the capital city.“For a 600-year period, Oxford and Cambridge vetoed the establishment of other universities in England. Trinity was the only other university to be established by royal charter,” says Prof Campbell.“What distinguishes Trinity further is that we have a campus with architecture of such monumental scale compared to the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge . . .“We have two million visitors a year who enjoy the campus or sit out with their sandwiches in the summer.We want our university to be a place that people walk around. It’s a balancing act we need to strike, due to security, litter and so on.”A criticism regularly levelled at the college is that it has turned its back on much of the city.The university started out as an enclosed campus and some surrounding streets have suffered as a result, such as the bleak and neglected section of Pearse Street close to the city centre.Change is coming: the new €80 million Trinity Business School is taking shape on Pearse Street, which will include a pedestrian entrance and public cafe.Further down the street, closer to the city centre, work is under way on the €62 million Printing House Square development, which will provide 250 student rooms over a health and sports centre. It will also feature a new public gateway into a new “public city square”.A new law school building – still at a concept stage – may also be housed on the street over the coming years.“Pearse Street is a challenging street with the volume of traffic, but it’s one we’ve invested in,” says Prof Campbell.“The Science Gallery has been enormously successful . . . the business school will be a great addition and the Georgian houses will have a new cafe facility that opens directly on to the street. These are tangible improvements that will really improve the retail offering.”Upgrading facilities to adapt to the changing way students learn will also feature in new developments.The days of the draughty lecture theatre are numbered, it seems. The college’s new E3 Learning Foundry – an engineering, energy and environment institute – will instead have “maker spaces” which allow students to work together on industrial techniques and processes and informal learning spaces, where students can collaborate on projects.“Empirical evidence is emerging of a positive correlation between time spent on campus and academic performance,” says Prof Campbell.“If we’re providing a good quality experience on campus, students will want to spend time here and do their informal learning, which is an important part of the modern curriculum.”The university is also planning to expand eastwards with the development of a €1 billion campus on Grand Canal Quay where it owns a 2.2 hectare (5.5 acre) site, though it is likely to take several years for these plans to be finalised.Despite the fast pace of development, it comes at a time when higher education institutions say they are facing a growing funding crisis.Yet, there are no fewer that four construction cranes on the horizon of Trinity. So, where’s all the money coming from?Prof Campbell says most new activity is funded exclusively from philanthropy, borrowing and private income generated by international students and other sources.The new E3 facility will involve €50 million in State funding, though this is the exception.“If we relied on exchequer funding we couldn’t realise our ambitions,” she says.“The other challenge is funding the refurbishment of our existing infrastructure and we haven’t had any exchequer support for that in recent years.”Trinity – like other third-level colleges – will need to expand over the coming years.Demographic trends indicate that numbers in higher education will swell by about 20 per cent over the coming decade.Trinity, which has about 18,000 students, is planning to grow by 3,500 over the next few years.“We need to have the appropriate facilities for accommodating students and staff,” says Prof Campbell.“We can’t pack them in like sardines – that’s not a quality education experience – and then we need to make sure we have sufficient staff of the appropriate calibre to train and interact with students.“There are significant resource implications in how we manage the size of the university of the future.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3752830.1547067221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alternative busconnects plan could affect further 80 homes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnne Graham, of the National Transport Authority, at a media briefing in November to unveil details of phase one of the BusConnects project.

A further 1,000 property owners are expected to be informed in the coming weeks in relation to the 12 other corridors.The NTA said the households on the Swords Road would be offered one-to-one meetings. The alternative plan is now part of the public consultation on the first four corridors, which runs until February 15th.A NTA spokeswoman said both options were “viable” and that the one-way system was initially proposed because “there was no impact along that area on any properties”.A community forum, established by the NTA to gain feedback on the Swords corridor, was told of the alternative option for the Swords Road on Tuesday.Fine Gael TD Noel Rock, who was at the meeting, said “the residents most directly affected by this weren’t in the room when the change was announced”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3752816.1547064415!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish researchers catch up with the speed gene in thoroughbred horses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Emmeline Hill of  Irish equine science company Plusvital in UCD. Photograph: Peter HoulihanFennell PhotographyAnalysis of the race records and genetics of thousands of thoroughbred horses in leading racing countries of the world has provided unequivocal evidence that the so-called “speed gene” is the main determinant of why some horses are born sprinters, and others are born stayers.The Irish research examined 3,000 thoroughbred racehorses which raced in Europe, Australia, South Africa and the US. It found the myostatin gene – the speed gene – is the almost singular genetic determinant of a horse’s optimum race distance. This confirms earlier work on horses in Ireland and Britain conducted by the team based at University College Dublin.The latest research, published this week in Equine Veterinary Journal, was led by UCD associate professor of equine science Emmeline Hill, who is also chief science officer at Irish equine science company Plusvital.The notion of a single gene being responsible for a performance trait in thoroughbreds was previously challenged. However, Prof Hill said this study has ended any dispute over the central role of the speed gene. Her initial work involved a sample of hundreds of horses in Ireland and Britain.This knowledge is extremely valuable to thoroughbred breeders and trainers, in what is a multibillion euro industry. When the researchers made the initial breakthrough, it led to the development of a genetic test, but many in the industry were averse to science, preferring to concentrate on look and lineage. Newer breeders, however, embraced the test more readily.“We have replicated and validated our original research findings on a massively larger scale. The power in the numbers has shown that the association of the speed gene with race distance is as statistically strong as the most highly genetically influenced traits in humans, including eye colour and the probability of an inidual going bald,” she said.In Europe more than 83 per cent of speed gene type known as “C:C” (sprint) horses had an optimum race distance of a mile or shorter, and more than 89 per cent of “T:T” (staying) horses ran best over distances greater than a mile.The trend was consistent across major race regions globally, but the race pattern also influenced distribution of the speed gene types. In Australia, where there is an emphasis on early two-year-old speed, there were almost twice as many C:C horses among elite race winners in the population compared to Europe and North America (46 per cent compared to 26 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively) and there were almost seven times as many C:Cs as T:Ts within the Australian population.The main differences between sprinters and staying-type horses has been shown to be caused by a mutation in the speed gene that alters the rate of muscle growth and fibre-type differences in muscle. Although myostatin is the most important gene, the research identifies other genes which have moderate effects on the staying ability of a horse related to muscular response to exercise, regulation of fat metabolism and oxygen consumption.Prof Hill said the application of genetics to decision-making about how horses were trained and raced is transforming the industry. “Our results clearly show that using evidence-based science will lead to more accurate placing of horses in races that are best suited to their genetic potential. Horses are a product of their inherited genetic characteristics as well as the environment.“The management of the horse is inarguably key in any horse’s success, but DNA differences are the undisputed differences that make them iniduals. This genetic information is leading to horses being trained and raced for their genetic potential and is providing a clear economic advantage to owners and trainers,” she explained.The research has relevance for the wider thoroughbred population. “Since there is just one gene that is a major player in the sprinting versus staying stakes, it is extremely vulnerable to selection pressures.“This has been recognised by the concern in the industry over the potential reduction in genetic ersity by favouring precocious, commercially-attractive horses. This concern is well justified – the staying type is at serious threat of extinction in the global population,” Prof Hill warned.It was essential the industry incentivised breeding and racing of stayers to reduce the pressure to breed for the sales ring, she added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3752589.1547065665!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland agrees to take five unaccompanied minors stranded in malta","story":"Migrants onboard the German rescue ship Sea-Watch 3 cheered and jumped for joy on Wednesday (January 9) as they were told they were finally heading for a port in Malta after weeks stranded at sea.

Photograph:  Matthew MirabelliAFPGetty ImagesThe Government has agreed to welcome five unaccompanied minors to Ireland out of a group of migrants who were rescued in recent weeks from the Mediterranean Sea. Minister for Justice and Equality Charlie Flanagan, and Minister of State for Equality, Immigration and Integration David Stanton said they were pleased to announce the move - part of an agreement between eight European countries to assist almost 300 migrants who have been brought to Malta since the start of December - as “as a gesture of solidarity and humanitarian assistance”.Speaking after discussions between Irish officials, the Maltese authorities and and the European Commission, Mr Flanagan said: “These children have been rescued from the Mediterranean Sea in humanitarian search and rescue missions and have been through a terrible ordeal.“They will be welcomed to Ireland under our Irish Refugee Protection Programme, which has a proven record of helping those who are most vulnerable. We will ensure that they are provided with all of the necessary supports.” There will be further contact between Irish and Maltese officials to establish the appropriate arrangements for the transfer of the unaccompanied minors to Ireland, the Ministers said.Earlier, the Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, announced that 49 people who were rescued by the German NGOs ships Sea-Watch 3 and Sea-Eye off the coast of Libya in December, would be allowed to disembark in the Maltese capital of Valletta before being sent to Italy, France, Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Romania, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.The ships, operated by two German charities, had been stranded in Maltese waters after Italy, Malta and other EU states refused to offer them a safe port.“The operation to transfer the migrants to our armed ships will start as soon as possible,” Mr Muscat said. “But the crisis wasn’t created by us. We’re not making a war against the NGOs, we’re appealing to all to respect the rules.”Mr Muscat added that the deal would also see the eight countries taking in 249 other people brought to Malta by its military patrol boats in December.“This risks becoming a huge problem,” he said during a press conference in Warsaw with the Polish interior minister, Joachim Brudzinski. The Sea-Watch 3, with 32 rescued people on board, had been waiting off the coast of Malta for 19 days, while an additional 17 were rescued on December 29th by Sea-Eye. Rescuers have spoken about the turmoil among the rescued people as the standoff continued, with some jumping into the sea in an attempt to reach Malta.Malta allowed the two ships to shelter from bad weather near its coast and for them to be resupplied with fresh food and water, but until now had refused to let those onboard disembark, arguing that they had been rescued beyond the country’s search-and-rescue zone.Between 2,000 and 3,000 people rescued in the Mediterranean have been denied entry into Italy in similar standoffs since Salvini, who leads the far-right League, started a clampdown on immigration within days of coming to power last June. Earlier this week he clashed with the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and his coalition partner, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, who both said that women and their children should be taken off the boats and brought to Italy. - Additional reporting "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3751627.1546973889!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"paris letter yellow vest riots are too close to home for city dwelling elites","story":"December 11th, 2018: Shuttered shops, burning cars and tear gas.

My apartment looks on to the government ministry that was invaded by insurgents driving a hijacked forklift truck on January 5th.The protest movement turned insurrection has come too close for comfort.I returned from a year-end holiday to find my neighbourhood in central Paris transformed. “The Future”, says graffiti on a shop in the boulevard St Germain, next to the circular A symbol of anarchy.The windows of my local Société Générale bank are shattered.The Banque Nationale de Paris protected its windows with plywood, on which the rioters listed the bank’s supposed sins, including “climaticide” and fomenting war in Sudan.Broken glass carpeted the street outside the cafe where I ate my first 2019 meal in Paris. I walked home past a scorched motorcycle, lying like a dead insect in front of Yves Saint Laurent headquarters.My Spanish concierge was traumatised by watching rubbish bins burning on the corner.My newspaper vendor said the yellow vests went on the rampage in our neighbourhood because they were pushed this direction by security forces.Most days, I go outside to find dozens of police vans lined up in surrounding streets. It’s like living in an armed camp.When the protests started in November, shops and banks would put plywood sheets over their windows late on Friday, then remove them on Sunday.Now they leave the protective siding in place, giving central Paris the allure of a shanty town.On December 29th, turnout for the protests dwindled to 12,000 nationwide. Many heaved a sigh of relief in the mistaken belief that the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement had been defused by president Emmanuel Macron’s promise of €10 billion to increase purchasing power.But on January 5th, 50,000 gilets jaunes came back with a vengeance. The demonstrations have morphed from a protest at (now cancelled) fuel taxes to a seditious movement that is determined to bring down the government.Prime minister Edouard Philippe announced on Monday night that he will deploy 80,000 police and gendarmes for “Act 9” on January 12th.But will hardcore anarchists and vandals really be deterred by legislation that would create a register for violent demonstrators, similar to the one for football hooligans?One of the most shocking images from the January 5th riots showed Christophe Dettinger (37), a former boxing champion, kicking a policeman on the ground on the Solferino footbridge over the Seine, and pummelling another policeman in the face.Dettinger had “liked” a photograph of Marion Maréchal, the rising star of the French far right, on his Facebook page. He risks five years in prison and a €75,000 fine.His supporters raised €117,000 for his defence by Tuesday morning, before the crowdfunding\u0026nbsp platform Leetchi closed the fund down. A similar fund, set up for the 1,050 police who have been wounded in riots, raised far less.In the old Guignols de l’info television show, the puppet version of former Trotskyist leader Arlette Laguiller promised in a soft voice to “string the bourgeois up by their entrails”.At three Christmas dinners I attended in Paris, I detected a frisson of fear in the French bourgeoisie, a premonition that we’d all be strung up.Virtually everyone I know likes Macron and detests the gilets jaunes. I could not understand why polls showed such high support for the protesters, until a colleague reminded me that in Paris, Macron won 90 per cent of the vote in the 2017 presidential election.Bourgeois means, literally, town-dweller. Most of the gilets jaunes are from the neglected countryside.Not by chance, they are attacking Paris, seat of the hated government, home to the ruling elite.On Monday, Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the populist Italian Five Star movement, urged the gilets jaunes, “Don’t let up!” His partner in government, Matteo Salvini, the head of the extreme right-wing League, expressed his support for “honest citizens who are protesting against a president ruling against his own people”.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN), formerly Front National, and an ally of Salvini, is the Chesire cat of the gilets jaunes movement. She is almost invisible, except for her smile.The demands made by RN in a statement this week are virtually identical to those of the gilets jaunes: the dissolution of the National Assembly and new elections based on proportional representation, which would probably hand the RN a third of the seats in the French legislature."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3752798.1547063128!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit house of commons divided in vote over plan b timeline","story":"UK Prime Minister Theresa May got in a fiery exchange with the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, when confronted on the lack of change on her Brexit deal. Video: Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeaker John Bercow in the House of Commons. Photograph: UK ParliamentMark DuffyPA Wire Dramatic scenes in the Commons on Wednesday saw MPs challenge the Speaker in angry points of order for more than an hour, and the House ide into almost equal factions.For John Bercow’s critics on the government benches, he had undermined the authority of his office and established a dangerous precedent by allowing MPs to amend a motion hitherto regarded as unamendable. To his admirers, who included Conservatives as well as opposition MPs, he was a fearless champion of the right of parliament to assert itself against the executive.Leaving the argument over procedure aside, however, the House’s approval of Dominic Grieve’s amendment to the motion on Theresa May’s Brexit deal could prove to be a hinge moment in the story of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. It represents parliament’s long-anticipated move to take control of a process that the minority Conservative government has shown itself incapable of managing successfully.If the prime minister’s deal is rejected, as expected, next Tuesday, she will have just three sitting days to come back to parliament with a motion outlining what she proposes to do next.That motion will be amendable, allowing MPs to test support for alternatives, including a Norway-plus model that would see Britain remaining in the single market and the customs union, and a second referendum that could stop Brexit.MPs demonstrated in a vote on Tuesday night that a majority opposes leaving the EU without a deal. But if the prime minister is unable to pass her deal, what chance do the alternatives have of winning a majority?Before the Christmas recess, support for Norway-plus appeared to be seeping away as Remainers, particularly on the Labour benches, started to believe that a second referendum was achievable. Labour seemed poised to take the steps agreed at its party conference last year that would lead it to support a second referendum, favoured by most of its members.Since parliament returned this week, however, the Labour leadership’s lack of enthusiasm for a second vote has remained undiminished and some wavering MPs have become anxious about the potential toxicity of another referendum. In the chamber yesterday, Conservatives Oliver Letwin and Ken Clarke were negotiating in public with shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, about the kind of compromise Labour could accept.A cross-party majority has revealed itself at Westminster this week to oppose a no-deal Brexit and assert parliamentary control over the withdrawal process. But it has yet to marshal itself behind a single plan for Brexit, without which Britain will crash out of the EU on March 29th.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

considering creating online safety commissioner minister","story":"Baroness Williams of TraffordDepartment for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportThe government is considering creating an online safety commissioner with powers to fine and investigate social media giants, a minister has revealed.Baroness Williams of Trafford, the Home Office Minister for Countering Extremism, said the department was looking at Australia’s pro-active model of regulating tech companies.The Home Office is currently drawing up a while paper with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which will establish new rules and penalties for social media companies.Australia has had an eSafety Commissioner since 2015, who has powers to fine social media companies for every day cyber bullying posts are not taken down.The role, which is currently held by former Microsoft and Twitter executive Julie Inman Grant, has recently also been given powers to enforce the removal revenge porn posts. These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policySecond summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump may be imminent, says South Korean presidentSeoul taxi driver sets himself alight in protest at ride-sharing app  Grammar schools send more ethnic minority students to Cambridge than all comprehensives combined250,000 children should be classed as victims of domestic abuse, says NSPCCPatient who went to A\u0026ampE 400 times in one year among \u0026#39frequent flyer\u0026#39 list \u0026#39Madam Cyn\u0026#39, Britain’s best-known brothel keeper, takes her place in historyNew RAF jet \u0026#39combat ready\u0026#39 in face of resurgent Russia threatFour in ten NHS organisations do not have a grip on their spendingThe real thing: how Coca-Cola shaped China\u0026#39s obesity policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May suffers second defeat in two days as MPs vote to prevent her \u0026#39running down clock\u0026#39M6 standstill: Man arrested after vehicle filled with suspected migrants pulled overNHS laboratory manager who was signed off work because of back pain was later caught competing in national dressage eventMarried music teacher had sex with choir boys as school faces questions over why she wasn\u0026#39t struck off soonerThe Undateables, review: a formula that requires no fixing or fiddlingCleaning Up, review: betting-addiction drama that makes you want moreJohn Bercow takes control of Brexit as critics warn his unprecedented move will have consequencesNicola Sturgeon threatened with inquiry over collapse of Alex Salmond sexual misconduct inquiryComment: The Prime Minister won\u0026#39t willingly take us out of the EU without a dealFamily of speedboat killer Jack Shepherd urge him to come home for his mother\u0026#39s sakeRape defendants must prove they actively sought consent, say top  judge and campaignersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/09/TELEMMGLPICT000185138024_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwDgGh3pkom49KxtKngnUa36K9dyKixjq8GqZuuMTIBE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"british family among latest suspected isil members captured","story":"Kurdish soldiers lead a blindfolded Indonesian man suspected of Islamic State links to a security centre in northern SyriaThree British women are among foreign suspected Islamic State members captured by Kurdish forces in Syria in recent days, the  understands, as they battle for the jihadists’ final redoubt.A mother and her two daughters -  in their late 20s and travelling with young children - fled the town of al-Shafaa in eastern Deir Ezzor province late last week among other wives of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) fighters and local civilians, Kurdish sources confirmed.The family has been sent to al-Hawl detention camp in northeastern Syria, joining another British woman, Zara Iqbal, from London, who has been there for several months.Roj Camp in northern Syria near the Iraqi border, where 370 women from 46 different countries are being held“They claim, as all the women do, that they were brought here by their husbands and that they have been trying to escape Daesh, the source said, using the Arabic acronym for the group.The latest capture brings to 13 the number of Britons being held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on suspicion of links to Isil, and will only add to the UK government’s headache.Kurdish fighters in Syria on Wednesday released the names of eight more foreign jihadists picked up by the SDF, days after confirming five were already in their custody.Among them is a 16-year-old from the US, whose name is being withheld by the  as he is a minor, as well as a German and a Russian, two Uzbeks, a Ukrainian, a Tajik and a Kazakh.It is thought the teenager was likely the son of another fighter, who was brought to Syria from America as a child.A large number of the Isil fighters left defending the last of the so-called caliphate are thought to be foreign. Without the language skills they have been unable to blend into the civilian population and flee, as a large numbers Arab fighters have done.The remaining jihadists who remain are mostly seasoned fighters who have little to lose and are prepared to die in a last stand.US army vehicles supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Hajin, in the Deir Ezzor province, eastern Syria,The Kurdish-led SDF has lost more than 600 fighters in the latest stage of the offensive aimed at defeating Isil, which was launched in September. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, 1,087 jihadists were killed in the same time period.SDF forces have been surprised by a number of counterattacks as well as waves of suicide bombings. On Sunday, Isil fighters took advantage of bad weather and poor visibility to unleash suicide attackers on an SDF position, leaving 23 fighters dead.  But SDF members told the  that Isil leadership has almost completely broken down in recent weeks, which has led to more fighters surrendering rather than blowing themselves up.The SDF is holding a total of 2,000 Isil members, but has warned they will not hold them indefinitely.The UK and European nations have been reluctant to take back citizens with ties to Isil, not wanting the legal challenge of prosecuting them or the potential security risk if they are released.The uncertain future of the detainees has been thrown into sharper focus since Donald Trump, the US president, declared last month the US would be withdrawing the some 2,000 troops it has in Syria supporting the Kurds.The fear is they may be freed if a solution cannot be found.Second summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump may be imminent, says South Korean presidentSeoul taxi driver sets himself alight in protest at ride-sharing app  250,000 children should be classed as victims of domestic abuse, says NSPCCGrammar schools send more ethnic minority students to Cambridge than all comprehensives combinedPatient who went to A\u0026ampE 400 times in one year among \u0026#39frequent flyer\u0026#39 list \u0026#39Madam Cyn\u0026#39, Britain’s best-known brothel keeper, takes her place in historyFour in ten NHS organisations do not have a grip on their spendingNew RAF jet \u0026#39combat ready\u0026#39 in face of resurgent Russia threatThe real thing: how Coca-Cola shaped China\u0026#39s obesity policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May suffers second defeat in two days as MPs vote to prevent her \u0026#39running down clock\u0026#39M6 standstill: Man arrested after vehicle filled with suspected migrants pulled overNHS laboratory manager who was signed off work because of back pain was later caught competing in national dressage eventMarried music teacher had sex with choir boys as school faces questions over why she wasn\u0026#39t struck off soonerThe Undateables, review: a formula that requires no fixing or fiddlingCleaning Up, review: betting-addiction drama that makes you want moreFamily of speedboat killer Jack Shepherd urge him to come home for his mother\u0026#39s sakeJohn Bercow takes control of Brexit as critics warn his unprecedented move will have consequencesNicola Sturgeon threatened with inquiry over collapse of Alex Salmond sexual misconduct inquiryComment: The Prime Minister won\u0026#39t willingly take us out of the EU without a dealRape defendants must prove they actively sought consent, say top  judge and campaignersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/09/TELEMMGLPICT000185182204_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"italys matteo salvini seeks build new populist european order","story":"Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini attends a joint news conference with Polish Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski in WarsawItaly’s pugnacious deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, called for an alliance with populists in Poland and elsewhere during a visit to Warsaw, setting the stage for a showdown with the EU establishment at European Parliament elections in May.Mr Salvini, who leads the nationalist, anti-immigrant League party, pledged to create a “new European spring” and to work with Poland’s ruling populists.It was his latest attempt to recruit Eurosceptic allies in a growing confrontation with the likes of Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.He vowed to forge a “new equilibrium” that would challenge the traditional pro-EU axis between Paris and Berlin.The Europe that will be born in June will have a different pace compared to the one of today, which is guided by bureaucrats, said Mr Salvini, who is also Italy’s interior minister, speaking alongside his Polish counterpart, Joachim Brudzinski.In Europe, one has always spoken about a French-German axis. We are preparing for a new equilibrium and a new energy in Europe. And Poland and Italy will be the protagonists of this new European spring, of this rebirth of true European values.Echoing nationalist populists such as Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Donald Trump, he said that some EU leaders tried to deny Europe\u0027s Judeo-Christian origins.”Mr Salvini arrived in Warsaw wearing a jacket with the word polizia or police on the back, two days after he was reprimanded by a union representing Italian firefighters for his penchant for donning firefighter and police uniforms at public events.He has much in common with Poland’s populists, including opposition to accepting migrants and criticism of the way in which Brussels imposes rules on national budgets.But there are differences, too – notably Mr Salvini’s admiration of and support for Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.Grzegorz Schetyna, Poland’s main opposition leader, described Mr Salvini’s party as a nationalist, radical and pro-Russian party. A group of 49 migrants will finally be allowed to disembark from two NGO rescue vessels which picked them up in the MediterraneanDuring his visit to Poland, Mr Salvini was highly critical of a deal reached during the day to allow 49 migrants to disembark from two NGO rescue ships in Malta.The migrants have been stranded at sea, suffering from seasickness and dehydration, for nearly three weeks amid wrangling between Italy and Malta over who would accept them.Under the deal, they will be resettled in eight EU countries: Italy, Germany, France, Portugal, Ireland, Romania, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.The migrants, including a baby and several children, were rescued by the NGO ships on December 22 and 29 while attempting the dangerous crossing from Libya to Europe.There were ecstatic cheers on board the Sea-Watch 3 when a crew member told them we have a safe port, it\u0027s over, according to a video tweeted by the German NGO Sea Watch International, which operates one of the vessels.But Mr Salvini said he was opposed to the EU-brokered deal, saying that it would only encourage people smugglers in Libya to put more migrants to sea.“I am, and I will remain, absolutely against any new arrivals in Italy. I will continue to work to expel the far too many illegals who are already in this country. To give in to pressure and threats from Europe and from the NGOs is a sign of weakness that is not worthy of the Italian people,” he wrote in a barrage of tweets that criticised the accord to allow the migrants off the boats.That put him at odds with Giuseppe Conte, Italy’s prime minister, who welcomed an end to the impasse.Mr Salvini was the architect of the policy, initiated last summer, in which Italian ports were closed to NGO vessels rescuing asylum seekers fleeing Libya by boat.Please review our commenting policySecond summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump may be imminent, says

Although Rami Malek is still nominated in the Best Actor category for his portrayal of frontman Freddie Mercury, the film itself lost out on the top prize, with the category instead being populated by BlacKkKlansman, The Favourite, Green Book, Roma, and A Star Is Born.The revelation has essentially reconfirmed that the Best Picture is prize is a two-horse race between Roma and A Star is Born. The latter’s lack of wins on Globes night – outside of the inevitable Best Song prize for “Shallow” – suggests Alfonso Cuarón’s Mexico-set drama has the edge, but the Baftas will be key in solidifying the real odds for Oscar night.Created with Sketch.The 15 best films of 2018 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Back in 2012, the howling omission of Olivia Colman from the Baftas’ Best Actress category, for her beautiful, devastating performance in Paddy Considine’s Tyrannosaur, made headlines. Her Peep Show co-star David Mitchell even called the decision “ridiculous”. When Meryl Streep went on to win for her role as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, in which Colman also appeared as Thatcher’s daughter Carol, she took to the podium and dubbed her co-star “inely gifted”.Clearly, she knew then what the Baftas have only now cottoned onto – that Colman was destined for greatness. Thank goodness they’ve not made the same mistake twice Colman is nominated, and will most likely win, for her role as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite.As was the case with the Golden Globes, and as will no doubt be the case when the Oscar nominations are announced, there is not a sole woman on this year’s Best Director list. Where is Debra Granik’s nomination for Leave No Trace, her powerful, understated follow-up to Winter’s Bone? What about Marielle Heller, whose film, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, got an Adapted Screenplay nod, and earned Richard E Grant a Supporting Actor nomination.Perhaps the most disappointing omission, though, is You Were Never Really Here director Lynne Ramsey. Given that the Baftas are usually champions of homegrown talent, it seems they’ve missed an open goal by failing to give the Scottish filmmaker her due recognition.This year\u0027s Baftas nominations list in fullThe Favourite and A Star is Born dominate Bafta nominationsEverything you need to know about the 2019 BaftasOne of the less expected films to be honoured with several nominations here is Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War, a passionate love story set in the ruins of post-war Poland, as a man and a woman from vastly different backgrounds – separated by both politics and the machinations of fate – cross paths. The film earned a nomination for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Not in the English Language.Pawlikowski won the award for Best Director at last year’s Cannes Film Festival and has been selected as Poland’s entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Whether it will earn nominations in any other categories at the Oscars is hard to guess.Given that this year, Brits dominated even at the Golden Globes, it would have been unforgivable for the Baftas to fail to recognise homegrown talent. The Favourite’s Rachel Weisz and First Man’s Claire Foy have earned Supporting Actress nominations, and of course The Favourite’s Olivia Colman has been nominated for Best Actress.As many surprised Golden Globes viewers were reminded earlier this week, Vice’s Christian Bale – nominated for Best Actor – is also, in fact, British, while this year’s obligatory idiosyncratic curveball is Steve Coogan’s nomination for Stan \u0026amp Ollie. The fact that there’s an Outstanding British Film category, meanwhile, means that brilliant films like Beast and You Were Never Really Here, which might otherwise have been ignored, get to share a little of the spotlight too.One of the more curious omissions from this year’s nominations is Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk, although it’s been recognised in both the categories for Original Music and Adapted Screenplay. The James Baldwin adaptation hasn’t quite picked up the same level of buzz as Jenkins’s previous film, Moonlight, although Regina King has so far been the favourite to win the Academy Award for Supporting Actress, so it’s unusual to see her not even make the nominations when it comes to the Baftas.Amy Adams, Claire Foy, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz have all been nominated as expected, King’s place in the category has apparently been taken by Margot Robbie for her performance as Queen Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots – presumably a case of a little preferential bias for a Brit production.You can read the full nominations below.\u0026nbspFollow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Its seasonal\u0026nbsptrading update rather cemented its\u0026nbspstatus as the supermarket sector’s current problem child.\u0026nbspCEO Mike Coupe said Christmas came late for the grocer. Critics immediately questioned whether it came at all.\u0026nbspSales for the 15 weeks to January 5 fell by 1.1 per cent excluding fuel, driven by a 2.3 per cent decline in general merchandise, for which read clothes and the stuff that Argos sells.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSainsbury\u0027s, Asda playing with fire by taking CMA to judicial reviewSainsbury\u0027s labels items needed by food banksFood did better, but a 0.4 per cent increase is hardly anything to shout about.\u0026nbspThe chain is still seeing action at its convenience stores (up 3 per cent) and online (twice that).\u0026nbspBut those numbers only serve to underline how poorly its big supermarkets are faring.\u0026nbspWorryingly, the grocer is beginning to establish a reputation for foul ups.\u0026nbspOnline, customers have complained about empty shelves at some of the stores. Then there was the PR debacle of the recently launched ‘wellness’ hubs. The reception was less than positive, not least when high profile commentators spotted sugary cereal bars that were, mistakenly we were told, included in the range.Isolated incidents? Perhaps. But too many of them and you start to develop a decidedly unhealthy narrative. \u0026nbspAs for that general merchandise, Argos has on occasion showed itself to be one of the better arrows in Coupe’s bow, but Sainsbury’s decided it would go easy on Black Friday discounting with entirely predictable results.\u0026nbspThe only consolation? It could have been a lot worse. Asos, the online clothes retailer, chose the same course and ended up having to issue an ugly profit warning. Retailers not named Amazon must wish they could send the event back to the US from whence it came. They should be so lucky.\u0026nbspYet again Coupe’s Sainsbury’s has given the distinct impression that it is drifting, with its executives focused on driving through the controversial planned merger with Asda at the expense of the core business. The latter has also had its troubles but recently it has been showing signs of life and is starting to look like Sainsbury’s saviour.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

It\u0027s government policy that\u0027s driving this and therefore government policy that is driving the increase in bills for consumers.”Daron Walker, senior reporting officer for smart metering at BEIS, said: “We are definitely not complacent. We fundamentally scrutinise and care about the cost of this programme as much as consumers do.”Ms Flint replied: “They are escalating. They are going up and there is no sign that they are going to go down.”Government will miss its own smart meter deadline, watchdog warns Smart meters to cut energy bills by just £11 a year, MPs saySimon Read: \u0027Smart meters will stop energy firms owing us cash\u0027Smart meters set to cost households £215 in return for minor savingsJames Ashton: Smart-meter plans aren\u0027t looking so brightUp to 53 million smart meters, which will replace traditional electricity and gas meters in homes and businesses, were due to be installed across Britain by the end of 2020 to meet the Government\u0027s target, saving households an average of £18 a year between 2013 and 2030 after they have met the costs of the programme.However, the rollout has struck a number of issues, with the NAO finding that about 70 per cent of first generation SMETS1 meters “go dumb” when people switch to a new supplier.The NAO said suppliers installed seven million more SMETS1 meters than planned after BEIS under-estimated how long it would take to implement the infrastructure and technical standards for their second-generation successors, with the mass rollout adding to the complexity and cost of the programme.BEIS planned to resolve the problem by connecting SMETS1 meters to updated infrastructure, but this project had been delayed by six months to May 2019 and the NAO said it was not certain if it would work as intended.The NAO said the significant delay to the start of the second-generation rollout was increasing the risk of escalating costs and technology being rolled out before defects had been addressed, also warning that it could take years before it was known if it entirely worked.However, the NAO concluded: “The facts summarised above, and many more, are not fatal to the viability and value for money of the programme.“However, there are serious issues that need to be addressed if smart meters is to progress successfully and deliver value for money.”gas and electricityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The ASA, which is funded by advertisers, does not have the power to fine companies.Last year, Provident was ordered to pay a £2m fine and £169m to 1.2 million Vanquis customers for selling an add-on product called a Repayment Option Plan (ROP) which was not fully explained.Hammond launches Budget assault on loan sharks and payday lendersWonga goes into administrationWe need to educate kids about money and the perils of payday lendersThe FCA has attempted to rein in providers of high-cost credit with rules capping\u0026nbsppayday loan interest rates charges in 2015. Last month, the regulator said providers must compensate consumers who had been missold\u0026nbsppayday loans, even in instances where\u0026nbspno complaint has been made.But concerns remain that cash-strapped borrowers are turning to payday loans and other expensive forms of credit in order to make ends meet.Last week, Bank of England data showed that credit card debt had risen 7.1 per cent in the year to November and now stands at £72.5bn.A representative from Provident said: “The ASA informed us of a complaint made about the advertisement and we subsequently removed it from circulation, prior to the ASA\u0027s final ruling.“Provident also provided assurances to the ASA that such content will not be used in any further marketing materials.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

App developers share data with Facebook through the Facebook Software Developer Kit (SDK), a set of software development tools that help developers build apps for a specific operating system.Apps found to be sharing data with Facebook included language-learning tool Duolingo, job database Indeed and flight search engine Skyscanner. A spokesperson for Skyscanner\u0026nbspsaid it had updated its data-collecting practices in the wake of the report.Facebook said that sharing data is common practice for many companies and that it did so in a transparent manner.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/09/13/zuckerberg.jpg","title":"facebook mark zuckerberg technology future 2019 resolution new year","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

It\u0027s government policy that\u0027s driving this and therefore government policy that is driving the increase in bills for consumers.”Daron Walker, senior reporting officer for smart metering at BEIS, said: “We are definitely not complacent. We fundamentally scrutinise and care about the cost of this programme as much as consumers do.”Ms Flint replied: “They are escalating. They are going up and there is no sign that they are going to go down.”Government will miss its own smart meter deadline, watchdog warns Smart meters to cut energy bills by just £11 a year, MPs saySimon Read: \u0027Smart meters will stop energy firms owing us cash\u0027Smart meters set to cost households £215 in return for minor savingsJames Ashton: Smart-meter plans aren\u0027t looking so brightUp to 53 million smart meters, which will replace traditional electricity and gas meters in homes and businesses, were due to be installed across Britain by the end of 2020 to meet the Government\u0027s target, saving households an average of £18 a year between 2013 and 2030 after they have met the costs of the programme.However, the rollout has struck a number of issues, with the NAO finding that about 70 per cent of first generation SMETS1 meters “go dumb” when people switch to a new supplier.The NAO said suppliers installed seven million more SMETS1 meters than planned after BEIS under-estimated how long it would take to implement the infrastructure and technical standards for their second-generation successors, with the mass rollout adding to the complexity and cost of the programme.BEIS planned to resolve the problem by connecting SMETS1 meters to updated infrastructure, but this project had been delayed by six months to May 2019 and the NAO said it was not certain if it would work as intended.The NAO said the significant delay to the start of the second-generation rollout was increasing the risk of escalating costs and technology being rolled out before defects had been addressed, also warning that it could take years before it was known if it entirely worked.However, the NAO concluded: “The facts summarised above, and many more, are not fatal to the viability and value for money of the programme.“However, there are serious issues that need to be addressed if smart meters is to progress successfully and deliver value for money.”gas and electricityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present.

The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema.

Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment.

The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative.

The British empire was seen by others around the globe as the cornerstone of its stability (imperial injustices aside). This view arose from the former British colonies’ familiarity with British troops, British industry and trade, as well as British soft power (the royal family and BBC) and what it used to mean for them, for their past and future.However, the increasing dominance of the US moonlight’s beam in the 20th century meant, naturally, the sunset of the British hegemony. Since the Americans grabbed the world’s remote control, there has been a reset – with the world order drastically changed in the American direction. And the world has received the new American cultural reality with few apparent\u0026nbspconflictions, except one, the British legacy. British officials, institutions and soldiers may have left their ex-colonies, but their imprint has remained.Due to its intertwining impact on the future and welfare of people in the UK, Brexit has tended to be seen, from abroad, as a local mess with no immediate implication anywhere else. Is it true though? Are citizens in other parts of the world immune to the effects of Brexit’s shrapnel? In any event, do people elsewhere care about us? Certainly it might be reasonable to think that it’s important to know what they make of us and of our country.350m a week for the NHS became a defining symbol of the Brexit referendum campaign (Getty)Many people in Britain see their country in mayhem, but they don’t necessarily know what to do to get themselves out of Brexit\u0027s snare (not even the government appears to have an answer, nor most of those who voted for EU withdrawal). The confusion over the outcome of the referendum in 2016 – which is psychological at its core – has been so powerful that it has split society in two. Some are doomed to see Brexit as a Noah’s Ark others are ready to put a big hole in it below the water line.But if you think we in the UK are confused, it should be said that people around the world follow events without having any clue about what on earth is happening here. Wherever you go now, the question on everyone’s lips is along the lines of: why are the British muddling themselves into this most abhorrent and unjustified self-harm?Brexit casts a dark cloud over our experts’ predictions for 2019Do not get me wrong, people from all over the globe watch the BBC too. Many are still able to form some sort of opinion on the subject. Indeed, given the complexities involved, this has created a paradoxical reality where someone in Nicaragua can be as educated on Brexit as a Brexiteer from the midlands of England. It’s not the information that people lack, it’s their ability to absorb (and perhaps contextualise) it.For many beyond our shores, the right acronym for this dogged quandary which the UK has been juggling with for two and a half years is political “civil war”. This might be a bit over-amplified, but it is, indeed, some kind of a war waging, but in a civil manner.Yet the outcome of the British conflict over Brexit still might, as the UK did in the past, play a role in forming the world’s reality. Exiting the EU has set a different course for the post-Second World War\u0026nbsporder a course which could end up setting Europe ablaze.People on the other side of the English Channel have certainly grown very sceptical about British integrity when it comes to doing business of any kind. There is no point signing a deal with a nation that appears unable or unwilling to honour its word on previous European deals it has been part of. This is what Britain’s image abroad has become in some quarters.Take the Norwegians as another example. Once a “Norway-style” option became a possible alternative to Ms May’s Brexit agreement, Norwegian politicians panicked mainly because, after turning our back on the EU, they duly thought that Britain could get Norway’s ship scuttled too. Many in Europe just don’t trust Britain anymore. They increasingly think that the British gamble over leaving the EU could wreak havoc on their own present and future.But Europeans are not alone. Americans watch Brexit with horror too. Well, not all Americans, but especially those who did not vote for Donald Trump. Trump supporters see Brexit as a victory on the same historical scale as their waggish president’s inauguration. But on the other side of the US political scene, life is gloomier.In fact, Brexit didn’t promote ision and fear only in Britain it also helped to create two Americas. One understands that Britain had no need whatsoever to depart the EU in order to deepen its ties with the US, as those disingenuous leavers are still trying to argue. This America represents the liberal institutions, most branches of officialdom and those who see the benefits of globalisation.Nevertheless, Trump is still pushing Britain to crash out with no deal, claiming that an endorsement of Ms May’s Brexit deal would mean the UK losing out on a favourable bilateral trade agreement with the US. This is not an off-the-cuff claim: it is a real bid from the most powerful man on the planet to sabotage the UK’s “special” relationship with America by feeding his own nationalist agenda.An opinion poll by Emerson College, published at the end of last year, showed that 91 per cent\u0026nbspof Americans support the “special relationship”.However, it seems that Americans have lost their faith in Britain as a trade partner. While\u0026nbspa majority still support a bilateral free trade agreement with the UK after Brexit, the poll showed that many in the US don’t think that Britain is a trustworthy partner to do business with. Of the respondents, 48 per cent\u0026nbsprated China as the most important trading partner for the US (76 per cent\u0026nbsphad China in their top two), and 20 per cent\u0026nbspwent for Canada first. Only 6 per cent of respondents saw Britain as the top trade partner (behind Israel and Australia too).Does the relationship, under Trump, still sound “special”?The other America – Donald Trump’s America – does not spare any thought to what’s happening abroad: it simply wants to take back control, supports building a wall on its border to stop immigration, chants “America first”\u0026nbspand wants to ditch multilateral institutions, such as Nato and the EU. It rings a bell, right?However, the association of Brexit’s bad boys with Trump’s presidential campaign was not the ultimate eye-catcher in terms of foreign involvement in the UK’s decision to split from the EU. What was most notable was capturing Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, and other leavers, in the same bed with Russia.Indeed, the alleged efforts of Banks and Farage to foster contact with both Russian officials and Trump’s campaign have raised concerns among investigators in the UK and the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit has so far proved to be a zero-sum game, and the only nation still in love with zero-sum games is Russia. There should be no doubt by now that Brexit will only play into Russia’s hands. The very notion of “apocalyptic Europe”\u0026nbsphas informed the national belief system of the poker-faced Russian president Vladimir Putin for years. Stumbling out of a humiliating defeat at the end of the Cold War, the ex-KGB officer always saw a united Europe as another Soviet Union, but on the other side of the game.Ostensibly, it looks like this assumption has a Russian government monopoly, but, as time passes, skies are becoming cloudier. Putin managed to manipulate the Russian people into his antagonised theory through fuelling acrimony towards the west. This has been always a key tactic, which has proved efficient in turning ordinary citizens – more or less compelled as they are to consume constant, malicious propaganda – to believe that Brexit can turn the wheel in Russia’s favour. It’s so obvious from every angle in the globe – except where Brexiteers sit, of course – that Russia can’t wait but to see us out (for its own ends).No wonder Moscow has been meddling in Brexit from day one. The US Senate published a report in January last year noting that UK campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of political donations if they are from “the beneficial owners of non-British companies that are incorporated in the EU and carry out business in the UK”. This opacity, the report suggested, “may have enabled Russian-related money to be directed with insufficient scrutiny to various UK political actors”.This came as experts from the University of California at Berkeley and Swansea University identified 150,000 Twitter accounts with Russian ties that had been spreading messages on Brexit, which is not even to mention the Russian-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik’s extensive and “systematically one-sided coverage” of the Brexit debate, as the Senate report put it.Russian fake news teams targeted Mueller to discredit Trump probeBut Russians don’t really like these “accusations”, and robustly defend their government’s theory no matter what (and its denial of involvement). “We all agree that the Russian government has nothing to do with Brexit, and didn’t intervene one bit. We are stunned by these accusations,”\u0026nbspElena Sobonina, a Moscow-based expert on Russia’s foreign policy, told me.“We are Europe’s closest neighbours, therefore stability of the continent is crucial for us. We can’t afford playing this game, but if you want to know who is really working on weakening the EU and Nato you have to look west, to the US”, she said. “Everyone in Russia believes so.”Russians can point to Trump as Europe’s biggest rival, they can also claim that they are the champions of the EU’s stability but in Putin’s eyes, Britain will always be a special enemy. \u0026nbspThe poisoning of the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in March last year in Salisbury helped Putin’s close circle to make the case to ordinary Russians. While wacky politicians, like Boris Johnson, were turning the show into an outcry for their own self-indulgent political tactics, Putin was mobilising Russia’s citizens – through their natural sense of grievance since the collapse of the Soviet Union – against Britain and what it represents.Britain’s hard stance on Russia – that it was to blame for the attempted assassination and ought to be punished – sent a message to Balkan and former Soviet nations that they would not be on their own, that Britain would not abdicate its responsibilities towards this part of the world, where people still perceive Russia as a threat. A young Lithuanian told me: “Old people, who lived under the Soviet occupation, do not invest in a home or\u0026nbspland because they still think the Russians will, eventually, come over and take everything away.”However, the way in which Britain’s position was perceived in ex-Soviet spheres of influence also uncovered a huge sympathy towards Russia and Putin’s cause in countries seen as crucial for Britain after Brexit, like China.British politicians have rarely been able to understand China due to a major misconception about its intentions. Ironically, Britain – the liberal empire which used to dominate the world – is plagued by isolationism and xenophobia, while the ex-communist acropolis, China, is becoming ever more free market orientated, undertaking a systematic process to liberalise trade.What I learned about Brexit inside the school for the French eliteDuring his visit to Beijing last summer, the\u0026nbspchancellor Philip Hammond seemed to be presenting Britain’s letter of credence to the Chinese, as they become the champion of free trade. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd sure enough, despite seeing Brexit as an imminent threat to the world’s economic stability, Chinese leaders still see it as a potentially big opportunity. Chinese businessmen, especially, believe it is a good idea to take advantage of the British “national desperation” to sign free trade deals. This promise, which has always been at the core of Brexiteer’s arguments for leaving the EU campaign, created Britain’s vulnerability in the eyes of pushy China. Chinese president Xi Jinping will trade with Britain, but this time on his own terms.In truth though, while China and the US are locked in a trade war, Britain’s dreams in the east seem diminished for now. Post-Brexit Britain will increasingly become dependent on the US (probably on Trump’s terms), and as long as Trump is in the Oval Office, the likelihood of any trade deal with China is minimal.As for ordinary Chinese craftsmen and small business owners, who look to foreign markets to sell their goods, many wonder why their British equivalents would countenance running away from the EU, the biggest market in the world. Asked about Brexit and how people back home see it, a Chinese restaurateur in London’s Chinatown told me: “People don’t get it! They just sit there mocking the British and having a laugh at them.”The real laugh is that Brexiteers are trying to sell a globalised “new” Britain, while leaving the very European organisation that still holds the global liberal system together and that is at the heart of global trade.According to the same diplomat, “Arab leaders want Britain to stay in the EU because they know that Brexit will hit its role on the international stage really hard, and subsequently we, in the Arab world, would have a lot at stake”.For Gulf countries particularly, trade with Britain is indisputably important. But in a region where stability (such as it is) still relies heavily on the US and the UK, any radical change in these two countries’ roles on the global stage would reflect heavily on the area. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“In the GCC, those who are traditionally bigger proponents of regional organisations see Brexit as a threat to regionalism tout-court, and see … the potential weakening of the EU as mirroring or anticipating the weakening of the GCC,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspCinzia Bianco, a researcher on Gulf-European relations at the University of Exeter.“This is especially because the GCC, for a period during the early 2000s, looked at the EU as a potential model in certain aspects,”\u0026nbspshe adds.Those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the Mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideasMany in the Gulf believe the UK was never meant to be part of the EU, and saw the UK as something different. According to Ms Bianco: “This is mostly due to the historical background of the UK being a semi-colonial power in the Gulf: GCC countries, therefore, have traditionally dealt with London on a bilateral level, with strong defence, political and economic relations, and very rarely through the EU.”This might explain why the Arab media is pretty much obsessed with Brexit. All the big ones – Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia, Al Ghad – and even local news channels now follow Brexit more than Syria or Libya’s bloody civil wars.But when you participate in a Brexit debate on one of these channels, the pressing question they all ask is: “Do you think another referendum will take place?” It sounds like Arabs, for some reason, want Britain to stay in the EU more than British people themselves. This interest is reflected in the number of Independent readers from the Middle East who are keen to read about the subject. Brexit is our best-read topic in Egypt.Why might this be? Maybe it is a subconscious sympathy hammered out of an historical feeling of association (for good or ill) with Britain’s affairs. Maybe it is a genuine fear that if Great Britain exits the EU, it will not be great again and its role in the Middle East will be diminished.An Arab diplomat reflected ironically on the question when I put it to him: “Maybe our people are afraid of European immigration if Brexit would, at some point in the future, result in the collapse of the EU.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Most seem to be aware, despite the extensive coverage, of nothing more than the bare fact that Brexit means Britain would be walking away from the EU. But their favourite question remains: “But, why?” And that is a good question indeed.“The reason why Brexit hasn’t been on the ordinary Arabs’ top of the agenda is that it happened in conjunction with what is called ‘the Arab Spring’, including the Syrian, Yemeni, and Libyan civil conflicts,”\u0026nbspsays Mohamed Kawas, a prominent French-Lebanese journalist.“On governments’ level, those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In fact, in their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideas”, he adds.It should be clear by now that Brexit is not just a local British dilemma. It will not only change people’s lives here, but in some other parts of the world too – directly or indirectly. This is due to its strategic and economic impact on Europe’s stability, Britain’s position on the world’s stage, and how Brexit will help Russia to rise again as a superpower in a new bipolar order.It is notable too that whereas the English language has always been a big help in making local issues, especially in the UK and the US, explicable internationally, the complexities of Brexit (and its inane explanations) did the opposite. For many outsiders, debate about Brexit remains something their eyes can see but their minds can’t process.Still, it has been the UK’s global standing as a nation of good repute that has been hit most. Those who always looked up to this country and its democratic and liberal values are united with those who loathe its imperial history and disastrous foreign policy decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq. Both sides – allies and foes – are now sceptical about Britain’s integrity and honesty, and doubtful about the extent to which other nations can any longer follow Britain’s leadership.\u0026nbspOf course, the British people themselves still have to get their heads around Brexit before anyone else. But whatever the outcome, it will not change the new reality:\u0026nbspthe damage is done, and Britain is not great anymore.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The ASA, which is funded by advertisers, does not have the power to fine companies.Last year, Provident was ordered to pay a £2m fine and £169m to 1.2 million Vanquis customers for selling an add-on product called a Repayment Option Plan (ROP) which was not fully explained.Hammond launches Budget assault on loan sharks and payday lendersWonga goes into administrationWe need to educate kids about money and the perils of payday lendersThe FCA has attempted to rein in providers of high-cost credit with rules capping\u0026nbsppayday loan interest rates charges in 2015. Last month, the regulator said providers must compensate consumers who had been missold\u0026nbsppayday loans, even in instances where\u0026nbspno complaint has been made.But concerns remain that cash-strapped borrowers are turning to payday loans and other expensive forms of credit in order to make ends meet.Last week, Bank of England data showed that credit card debt had risen 7.1 per cent in the year to November and now stands at £72.5bn.A representative from Provident said: “The ASA informed us of a complaint made about the advertisement and we subsequently removed it from circulation, prior to the ASA\u0027s final ruling.“Provident also provided assurances to the ASA that such content will not be used in any further marketing materials.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It both deepens the mystery and offers a potential opportunity to finally understand what might be throwing out the burst from a galaxy billions of light years away.Fast radio bursts have been speculated to be the result of everything from exploding stars to transmissions from aliens. But they have remained entirely mysterious, with little evidence at all of where they might be coming from.The flashes only last for a milisecond but they are flung out with the same amount of energy the sun takes 12 months to produce.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialProbably most exciting of the new bursts is one that scientists saw repeat six times, apparently from the same location. Of the more than 60 fast radio bursts detected so far, only one of them has ever repeated.\u0026nbsp“Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB. Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles—where they’re from and what causes them,” said Ingrid Stairs, a member of the CHIME team and an astrophysicist at UBC.Seeing two repeating signals probably means that there exists – and that humanity will probably find – a\u0026nbspsubstantial population of repeating signals, the researchers write in one of the two papers published in\u0026nbspNature.Having two sets of repeating bursts could also allow scientists to understand what distinguishes them from single bursts, helping them understand more about their source and watch for future blasts.Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemIn all the researchers spotted some 13 of the bursts in just a three week period, offering a vast new trove of data for the scientists hunting for their source. Together they could offer some evidence of the extreme or unusual environment they are coming from – or the mysterious technology that some claim alien civilisations could be launching them into space with.“Whatever the source of these radio waves is, it’s interesting to see how wide a range of frequencies it can produce. There are some models where intrinsically the source can’t produce anything below a certain frequency,” says team member Arun Naidu of McGill University.The blasts were discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment in British Columbia. Some scientists had worried that the range of frequencies it can pick up would be too low for it to receive the FRBs – but it found far more than expected, and scientists expect it to identify even more.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But here we were lucky, and caught this one, and can now study it in more detail.”Even despite being called small by the scientists who found it, the world is still huge compared to us: it is about three times our size, and\u0026nbsp23 times as massive. That puts it in the category of a sub-Neptune, and means that it would be the first roughly Earth-sized planets to have been found by TESS.But it is unlikely to look much like our own planet. It\u0027s probably made of gas like Neptune or Uranus, though something far more dense than their atmospheres.“We think this planet wouldn’t be as gaseous as Neptune or Uranus, which are mostly hydrogen and really puffy,” Dragomir says. “The planet likely has a density of water, or a thick atmosphere.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It was one of those beams of light, thrown out from the quasar, that happened to pass near a galaxy that happened to bend and magnify the light, sending it towards us and allowing it to be seen today by Nasa-sponsored researchers.Black hole spotted by Nasa provides new insight into mysterious bodiesIf it weren\u0027t for this makeshift cosmic telescope, the quasar\u0027s light would appear about 50 times dimmer, said Xiaohui Fan of the University of Arizona, who led the study. This discovery demonstrates that strongly gravitationally lensed quasars do exist despite the fact that we\u0027ve been looking for over 20 years and not found any others this far back in time.Scientists were able to take observations of the light from the Gemini Observatory, along with data from other observatories, and understand where it had come from.When we combined the Gemini data with observations from multiple observatories on Maunakea, the Hubble Space Telescope, and other observatories around the world, we were able to paint a complete picture of the quasar and the intervening galaxy, said Fan.The light came soon after what is known as the Epoch of Reonisation\u0026nbsp– when the very first light came about.This is one of the first sources to shine as the Universe emerged from the cosmic dark ages, said Jinyi Yang of the University of Arizona, another member of the discovery team. Prior to this, no stars, quasars, or galaxies had been formed, until objects like this appeared like candles in the dark.Quasars are very intense sources of energy that are fuelled\u0026nbspby black holes, and are thought to have been around in the very first galaxies in the universe. They are so bright and distant they can offer a unique glimpse into the beginnings of the cosmos, as in this case.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He will be a target. I don\u0027t think it is wise to send him back to a situation where he will suffer persecution.Former NHS nurse born in UK with no criminal record deported to GhanaChristian man \u0027beaten by Islamic extremists\u0027 facing deportationHome Office u-turns on deporting former convict turned prison reformerDue to religious persecution in their home country, Mr Samson\u0027s entire family has left and he and his two siblings settled in the UK. But while his siblings\u0026nbspboth have spousal and unmarried partner visas, he has been unable to secure his status.Mr Samson’s asylum claim was rejected earlier this year and he was detained in Morton Hall Detention Centre in Lincoln last month, where he was told he was to be deported.After he was detained in December, he said: “If they do send me back my life will be really in danger. I’m so scared. People know who I am, they know I am a Christian and they have seen me on social media.“They told me they had booked me a flight and I refused to go. They said next time they will take me by force. They are trying to send me to a place where I will be at risk.”Mr Samson and his family are regular churchgoers in Hall Green, Birmingham, and have spent more than 10 years as active members of the Christian community.Revered Lorraine Shorten, who has known the family\u0026nbspfor 15 months and is pastor at their church of 10 years, said he was a “well-thought-of” member of the community.Christian man \u0027beaten by Islamic extremists\u0027 facing deportationThe church leader added: “This is shameful – we are a Christian country yet we can’t help them. It’s terrifying to send him back there with the situation for Christians in Pakistan.”“They are a part of this community. They want to live and work and remain here. They are not a risk to anybody. The Home Office just sees them as a number.“At home they were threatened and they lived in fear. This is so extremely short-sighted by the Home Office.”Friends of Mr Samson, who say they fear he is in “mortal danger”, have started a petition for him.The grant rate for asylum applications dropped from 33 per cent per cent to 30 per cent in the two years to 2017, while the overall number of applications fell by 8 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The key paragraph is 23, which says: “We will … legislate in domestic law to ensure that a UK Minister will be required to seek agreement of the Northern Ireland assembly before reaching any agreement in the UK-EU Joint Committee to add additional alignment provisions to the scope of the Protocol.”What this\u0026nbspmeans in principle\u0026nbspis that, if the backstop comes into effect, the Northern Ireland assembly would be able to block changes to it.Why is there no government in Northern Ireland?The backstop, the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, is likely to come into effect after the transition period – assuming the UK leaves the EU with a deal. Indeed, it is the legally binding fallback in the absence of a long-term trade deal that would achieve the same thing.That is why the DUP doesn’t like it. It objects to the enhanced checks required on goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, which it calls a “border in the Irish Sea”. And it absolutely hates the fact that the UK cannot get out of the backstop without the consent of the EU.This last point in particular is also very unpopular with Conservative MPs, and so the prime minister has been trying to find ways of reassuring them and the DUP before the vote of the House of Commons on the Brexit deal next Tuesday.She still seems to be hoping to come back to the House with legal assurances from the EU that the backstop would be temporary, but in the meantime she is doing what she can to try to persuade the DUP and Tory hard Brexiteers.Hence Wednesday’s document, which deals with a long-range detail: what would happen if EU laws change, requiring changes in Northern Ireland\u0026nbspto keep its standards in line with the EU single market?The document says the assembly would have a veto in those circumstances. Unfortunately, that is undermined by the prior commitment in the document to international law, which would include the withdrawal agreement, meaning that changes to the backstop have to be agreed with the EU.So the document is unlikely to change many minds. It has already been condemned as “cosmetic and meaningless” by the DUP.And there is one rather more obvious flaw with it, which is that there is no assembly currently sitting at Stormont, because the devolved government there has been suspended for two years now.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Police surround a pro-Brexit protester after he confronted a pro-European protester A police officer speaks with anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayConservative MP David Davies, wearing a gopro camera, speaks to anti-Brexit protester Steve BrayUnder the terms of the withdrawal agreement, the UK and EU must attempt to strike a deal on their future relationship before the end of 2020.If that is not possible, they will either trigger the backstop, which sees the UK enter into a temporary customs union with the EU, or will be able to extend the transition period for a maximum of two years to allow for a deal to be completed.Any decision made by the UK in relation to the backstop or an extension of the transition period would\u0026nbspneed to be approved by the EU. If the two sides could not\u0026nbspagree, the matter would go to independent arbitration.\u0026nbspIt is thought that, while the UK would still be legally obliged to enter the backstop if there is no alternative, even if MPs\u0026nbspvote against it, the political pressure would be so great that ministers would likely have to try to agree an alternative plan with the EU.Labour could force Corbyn to dump pro-Brexit stance, party admitsMPs vote to force May to reveal Brexit plan B within daysBrexit: MPs vote by 308-297 to defeat PM and accept Grieve amendmentMinisters tell May to force through Brexit by calling April electionStephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, admitted that accepting Sir Hugo’s amendment\u0026nbspwould not be enough to satisfy angry Brexiteers but said that, together with new plans to give the Stormont Assembly a “strong role” in managing the backstop, it marked a “welcome step forward”.He told the Commons: “I recognise that that alone will not be sufficient for all of the concerns that colleagues may have, but I think it is a welcome step forward.”But the move was swiftly dismissed by leading Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, who said: “This flimsy rubbish will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded. Most of us have made our decision on the treaty text, which is what matters.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It’s set out in our constitution – that’s a fact.”Clause 5 of the constitution states that, when Labour is in opposition, various strands of the party must decide “which items from the party programme shall be included in the manifesto”.What is the ‘Grieve amendment’ that could change Brexit?Brexit: Can the PM give Stormont a veto on the Irish border backstop?Theresa May will soon be forced to unveil her Plan BMinisters tell May to force Brexit by postponing election They are: the national executive committee, the shadow cabinet, the parliamentary Labour party’s committee and the chairman and vice-chairmen of the national policy forum.The spokesman said Mr Corbyn would not seek to “overrule” the clause 5 decision and, asked if he would stay on as leader even if he opposed, he\u0026nbspreplied: “Of course.”In December, asked if the paralysis in parliament made the case for a fresh referendum Mr Corbyn replied: “I think we should vote down this deal. We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Today\u0026nbsphis spokesman refused to be drawn on whether Labour would support an extension of the Article 50 process, to allow either an election or a referendum,\u0026nbsp“We are not pressing for an extension to Article 50, but, if that has to happen, that’s the responsibility of the government.”But\u0026nbspin the Commons chamber, Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, said a pause beyond 29 March “may well be inevitable”.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Theoretically, this means MPs will vote on the motion later today.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBercow is expected to outline his reasoning shortly after prime minister\u0027s questions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSpeaker\u0027s office *finally* confirm Grieve amendment has been selected. It had already been confirmed by Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who tabled the motion.\u0026nbspIt means John Bercow will put the question to MPs in the Commons around 1pm - shortly after prime minister\u0027s questions.\u0026nbspPrime minister\u0027s questions has now started. Theresa May opens up the session by paying tribute to Paddy Ashdown - the former Lib Dem leader who died over the Christmas recess.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe condemns\u0026nbspthreats of violence and intimidation against politicians and the media in recent days on College Green.\u0026nbspPoliticians and the media should be able to go about their work without harassment and intimidationJeremy Corbyn says he agrees with the PM on intimidation against the media and MPs. He says May is bringing back exactly the same deal she delayed four weeks\u0027 ago, before the Christmas recess.\u0026nbspThe PM says the conclusions of the European council went further than before - and she says further clarification on the backstop is possible.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says MPs\u0026nbspwill get a vote on whether to trigger backstop or extend the transition period if no new trade agreement is in place by 2020.Corbyn says over £4bn is being wasted on no-deal planning - something the House expressed its will against on Tuesday evening in the first defeat for a government on a Finance Bill since 1978.\u0026nbspHe asks the PM to rule out no deal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMs May says the government has negotiated a deal with the EU that protects jobs. She adds it is absolutely sensible for the government to plan for a no-deal scenario.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn says the PM has spent the last week\u0026nbspbegging the EU for changes, but nothing has been changed to the withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe asks - naturally - for a general election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut May hits back, pointing out confusion in Labour\u0027s Brexit policy.\u0026nbsp“His Brexit policies are the many not the few, she says.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Monday 21 could be parliament’s last chance to avoid the cliff edge. The decision on a people’s vote can’t be put off any longer.”Sarah Wollaston, a leading Tory Final Say supporter, said it was time for the prime minister to concede a fresh referendum on Brexit without delay.“Because parliament has reached an impasse, the right thing for her to do is say ‘parliament can’t decide, I’m going to take it to the people direct’,” she said.Created with Sketch.

It’s wake up time – we have a very short time in which to sort this out.”But Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out it did not have legal force, saying: “Parliament can pass motions saying the moon is made of green cheese, but that doesn’t mean it’s legally binding.”A total of 17 Tory MPs rebelled, including Ken Clarke and Final Say supporters Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah, Jo Johnson, Philip Lee and Anna Soubry.The fresh setback for the prime minister came as she put herself on another collision course with Brussels, after toughening her stance on the Irish border backstop.The government accepted a backbench amendment that could give the Commons a veto over entry into the backstop – even though it would be legally bound to do so, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement.Furthermore, if the backstop is implemented, the government would have “a duty to have an agreed future relationship or alternative arrangements” with one year, so it “ceases to apply”.Both contradict the orce deal, under which the UK agreed the backstop was the default option if a trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 and that it should apply indefinitely.The move risked the EU’s wrath while being clearly designed to win over Tory MPs posed to vote down the prime minister’s deal next Tuesday.But it was immediately dismissed by one leading Brexiteer, former minister Steve Baker, who said: “This flimsy rubbish will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded. Most of us have made our decision.”Until the Grieve defeat, Ms May was only required, after losing on her deal, to make a statement on what will happen next within 21 calendar days and then allow a vote in the Commons within seven sitting days.That subsequent motion was not expected to be amendable until Mr Grieve’s victory, last month, which meant MPs would be able to put forward their alternatives – but only for indicative votes.Before the defeat, Tory MPs raged at Mr Bercow for more than one hour, raising numerous points of order to vent their fury, in the closest the Commons comes to a riot.David Natzler, the Commons clerk and expert on parliamentary procedure, was believed to have advised Mr Bercow that the Grieve amendment should be struck out, because it clashed with standing orders.If the government does table the required motion within three working days, it could come very late on 21 January, postponing any debate until the following day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The vote was due to be held in December but the prime minister delayed the clash at the eleventh-hour in the face of certain defeat.The debate is now being re-run, beginning on Wednesday and running through to Tuesday night, when the so-called meaningful vote will be held.Under current rules, if Ms May’s deal is defeated in the Commons, the prime minister has 21 days, plus seven sitting days, to return to the chamber and offer MPs an alternative, or another vote.But Mr Grieve, a leading Tory Brexit rebel, tabled an amendment\u0026nbspto the business motion which would require Ms May\u0026nbspto return within three days of losing the vote.Brexit: Can the PM give Stormont a veto on the Irish border backstop?Ministers tell May to force Brexit by postponing election Cross-party MPs\u0026nbspbacked the move, defeating the government by 308 votes to 297.Why are MPs so annoyed about it?Conservatives are furious that Mr Bercow accepted the Grieve amendment, as parliamentary rules usually only allow a government minister to amend motions of this kind.The Commons descended into chaos as Brexiteers accused the Speaker of being partisan and overruling long-held procedures. Labour MPs cheered and spoke in support of Mr Bercow.It ties into long-running anger among some Tory MPs, who say Mr Bercow is too friendly towards Labour and pro-EU groups – as the Speaker is supposed to be impartial.What does it mean for May’s dealvote next week?Mr Bercow made it clear that the motion does not carry legal force, but it does significantly increase the pressure on Ms May to speed up the Brexit process.The prime minister is still expected to lose the vote next week, as she does not appear to have won fresh concessions from Brussels over the Christmas break that would convince her mutinous MPs to support the deal.If she loses, the Grieve amendment means she has three working days to return to the Commons with new plans – limiting the amount of time she has to go back to the EU.Does it increase the likelihood of a general electionsecond referendum?The defeat is a fresh humiliation for Ms May and a clear sign of her weak grip on her party and the Commons. But she has endured defeats that would have toppled other prime ministers, so this is not enough to end her premiership.The key outcome from the Grieve amendment is MPs will be allowed to put forward their own ideas, such as a Norway-style deal or even a second referendum.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave.

Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

their\u0026nbspcontroversial proposals to the next meeting\u0026nbspof the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), to be held in\u0026nbspSri Lankan capital\u0026nbspColombo\u0026nbspin May.\u0026nbspElephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from ivory shipmentsIvory sold illegally across Europe, driving elephants to extinctionUK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantAfrican countries tell EU to ban ivory tradeAfrican elephant numbers have plummeted in recent decades, largely because of widespread poaching for ivory, which is illegally sold to south-east Asian buyers.According to WWF, every year about 20,000 African elephants are killed by poachers for their tusks – an average of one every 25 minutes.Born Free believes that populations have dropped from five\u0026nbspmillion a century ago to fewer than a tenth of that\u0026nbspnumber now.\u0026nbspBotswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe, who argue that ivory trading will pay for conservation, want to sell government-owned stocks of raw ivory.After seeing decades of poaching, Cites banned international sales of new\u0026nbspivory in\u0026nbsp1989,\u0026nbspallowing elephant numbers slowly to recover.\u0026nbspBut\u0026nbspin 1999 and 2008, Cites\u0026nbsplet first Japan, then Japan and China, buy many tons of ivory in experimental sales, which conservationists say\u0026nbspenabled traffickers to again ply their trade because it can be impossible to tell legal ivory from poached.\u0026nbspThe poaching crisis is still acute, and any legal market has the potential to stimulate demand for ivoryToday China, the US and the UK have banned ivory sales but many countries still allow some commercial trade, and illegal poaching has continued despite efforts by African governments to crack down.\u0026nbspCites watchers suspect on balance that the three proposals are unlikely to win the two-thirds majority – of 183 members – needed for them to pass.“There isn’t really any appetite in the international community to agree to this,” said\u0026nbspColman\u0026nbspO’Criodain, a wildlife trade expert for WWF. \u0026nbspBut Peter Knights, chief executive of the\u0026nbspWildAid\u0026nbspcharity, warned that any relaxation of restrictions could lead to a massive rise in elephants killed.He said Cites’ earlier one-off sales had failed to stem demand.\u0026nbsp“Between 1975 and 1989, elephant numbers halved due to poaching and ivory being laundered into the ‘legal’ trade,” he said. “In 2008 the experiment was re-run with similar results – poaching escalated up to 33,000 a year.Surge in African elephant killings for ivory leads to drop in numbers“History has shown that traders find a way to use legal trade as a poaching conduit so we need to use other income sources, such as tourism, to support conservation.”\u0026nbspThe proposals are likely to be opposed by Kenya and Gabon, supported by conservationists, who believe even limited trade fuels demand and drives up killing.\u0026nbspKenya and Gabon want elephants in southern Africa to be promoted from Appendix II to Appendix I, which would mean the creatures were officially considered at risk of extinction.Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa have more than half of Africa’s total elephant populations between them.In October, Botswana’s president Mokgweetsi Masisi\u0026nbspjoined the Giants Club, which aims to\u0026nbspprotect\u0026nbsphalf of Africa’s elephants by 2020.\u0026nbspAs human populations increase, wildlife habitats are under increasing pressure, putting the mammals at greater risk of being killed as they stray onto land where crops are grown in search of food.\u0026nbspIn 2016, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature reported that Africa’s elephant population had suffered its worst decline in 25 years. In East Africa, elephant populations had nearly halved in a decade.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbspcensus across 18 countries\u0026nbspalso found that in seven years, 30 per cent of Africa’s elephants had disappeared.\u0026nbspZambia said elephants were competing with people in rural areas for resources and that Zambians would be more tolerant if they see “economic returns earned from the sustainable use of elephant”.\u0026nbspAt its last meeting in Johannesburg in 2016, Cites rejected appeals to relax ivory trade bans, and Matt\u0026nbspCollis, a Cites expert at the\u0026nbspInternational Fund for Animal Welfare, agreed that unless anything substantial had changed, the new proposals would probably not have enough support.Mr Collis said it\u0026nbspmade no sense to sell off stockpiles again when the poaching crisis remained\u0026nbspso severe.Created with Sketch.Campaigners call on Indian PM to end torture of captive elephants Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The treatment of captive elephants in Kerala is branded \u0027India\u0027s shame\u0027\u0027Elephants\u0027 in chainsAt the Indian High CommissionThe protesters were fighting to open the world\u0027s eyes to the hidden crisis, urging people to use the hashtag breakthechainsCampaigners came in elephant masksOutside the High Commission, India House\u0027Elephants\u0027 in chainsThe treatment of captive elephants in Kerala is branded \u0027India\u0027s shame\u0027\u0027Elephants\u0027 in chainsAt the Indian High CommissionThe protesters were fighting to open the world\u0027s eyes to the hidden crisis, urging people to use the hashtag breakthechainsCampaigners came in elephant masksOutside the High Commission, India House\u0027Elephants\u0027 in chainsThe “isive” proposals were a distraction from what the world should\u0026nbspfocus\u0026nbspon: supporting countries to put more resources into elephant protection, he said.\u0026nbsp“The poaching crisis is still acute, and any legal market has the potential to stimulate demand for ivory,” he added.\u0026nbspChina banned ivory trading in 2017, and last year Hong Kong promised to phase out its elephant ivory trade by 2021.Last month a UK law banning ivory sales – with a few strict exceptions – passed through parliament.\u0026nbspBut Vietnam, Thailand and Laos remain big markets.The US has effectively banned ivory deals, and after some wrangling with Donald Trump, US officials now review permits on a case-by-case basis.But the world’s largest exporter of legal ivory is Europe.\u0026nbspIn 2017, the European Commission banned the export of raw ivory, but not products containing it.

While his response to the disaster in Houston was generally applauded, the President picked up some flack when he gave a speech outside Houston (he reportedly did not visit disaster zones), and praised the size of the crowds thereDuring his first-ever speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Donald Trump tried out a new nickname for North Korea leader Kim Jong-un: Rocket Man. He later tweaked it to be “little Rocket Man” as the two feuded, and threatened each other with nuclear war.

The White House initially said that the decision was made after consultation from the Justice Department. Then Mr Trump himself said that he had decided to fire him in part because he wanted the Russia investigation Mr Comey was conducting to stop2125 Not realising being president would be \u0027hard\u0027Just three months into his presidency, Donald Trump admitted that being president is harder than he thought it would be.

The Justice Department later clarified: Mr Obama had not, in fact, done so2325 Claiming there had been 3 million \u0027illegal votes\u0027Donald Trump was never very happy about losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by 2.8 million ballots. So, he and White House voter-fraud commissioner Kris Kobach have claimed that anywhere between three and five million people voted illegally during the 2016 election. Conveniently, he says that all of those illegal votes went to Ms Clinton. (There is no evidence to support that level of widespread voter fraud.)2425 Leaving Jews out of the Holocaust memorial statementJust days after taking office, Donald Trump’s White House issued a statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, but didn’t mention “jews” or even the word “jewish” in the written statementDonald Trump’s inauguration crowd was visibly, and noticeably, smaller than that of his predecessor, Barack Obama. But, he really wanted to have had the largest crowd on record. So, he praised it as the biggest crowd ever.125 Joked about the Nazi occupation of France to President MacronIn this tweet on November 13, the President mocks Emmanuel Macron\u0027s suggestion of a true, European army by invoking the conflict between France and Germany in the world wars225 Coloured in the US flag wrongThe President coloured in the US wrongly during a visit to a children\u0027s hospital in Columbus, Ohio. He added a blue stripe where in tradition, and statute, there have been only white and red stripes325 Railing against the Mueller investigationThe President has repeatedly claimed that the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, is a rigged witch hunt425 Contradicting a US intelligence report on Russian meddling in the presence of Vladimir PutinIn the press conference that followed his landmark meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr. Trump stated that he saw no reason why Russia would have meddled in the 2016 US election. This contradicted a 2017 report by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence that found evidence of Russian interference in favour of Mr. Trump 525 Contradicting his contradiction of a US intelligence report on Russian meddlingFollowing furious backlash in the US, the President claimed that he meant to say that he saw no reason why it wouldn\u0027t have been Russia who meddled in the 2016 US election. As to why he would have intended to use such bizarre phrasing, he did not comment625 Firing a Secretary of State over TwitterThe President announced on Twitter that he was appointing Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, much to the surprise of then Secretary of State Rex Tillerson725 Quoting a catchphrase from a reality TV show when discussing police brutalityWhile addressing the issue of black athletes not standing for the national anthem in protest of police brutality, the President made reference to his catchphrase from reality TV show The Apprentice: you\u0027re fired!Ever one for diplomacy, the President reportedly referred to African nations as s***hole countries. Asked to confirm this when meeting with Nigeria\u0027s President Buhari, Mr. Trump stated that there are some countries that are in very bad shape.Donald Trump appeared to equate US foreign actions to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying, “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent?”1025 Asked for people to \u0027pray\u0027 for Arnold SchwarzeneggerAt the National Prayer Breakfast, Donald Trump couldn’t help but to ask for prayers for the ratings on Arnold Schwarzenegger’s show to be good. Schwarzenegger took over as host of “The Apprentice” — which buoyed Mr Trump’s celebrity status years ago1125 Hanging up on Australian PM Malcolm TurnbullEarly in his presidency, Donald Trump reportedly hung up the phone on Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after the foreign leader angered him over refugee plans. Mr Trump later said that it was the “worst call” he had had so farPerhaps one of his most controversial policies while acting as president, Donald Trump’s travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries has bought him a lot of criticism. The bans were immediately protested, and judges initially blocked their implementation. The Supreme Court later sided with the administration’s argument that the ban was developed out of concern for US securityAfter Hurricane Harvey ravaged southeastern Texas, Donald Trump paid the area a visit. While his response to the disaster in Houston was generally applauded, the President picked up some flack when he gave a speech outside Houston (he reportedly did not visit disaster zones), and praised the size of the crowds thereDuring his first-ever speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Donald Trump tried out a new nickname for North Korea leader Kim Jong-un: Rocket Man. He later tweaked it to be “little Rocket Man” as the two feuded, and threatened each other with nuclear war.

Politicians seeking\u0026nbspthe White House frequently visit the prairie state at the beginning of campaigns.Despite Mr Steyer\u0027s efforts to pressure politicians into supporting impeachment hearings, the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives remains cautious about trying to remove Donald Trump from office.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that the House shouldn\u0027t move to impeach Trump without more facts and added that the effort would be isive.Mr Steyer\u0026nbspobjected to that\u0026nbspapproach during his Iowa appearance.\u0026nbspIf someone says there are tactical, political reasons not to do the right thing for our country, I would say that\u0027s not the basis on which we\u0027re making decisions, he said.The billionaire will remain an influential figure in the 2020 campaign, despite bowing out as a possible candidate.He had built a network of organisations that are likely to affect both the presidential race and key congressional races across the US.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Thanks to this Prime Minister, we haven’t a clue how  will start, let alone finish.Chaos is the only certainty as the Government faces parliamentary defeat over her Chequers botch.We might then be in for a grinding marathon of rematches, a crisis General Election, a second referendum or — the only really positive option — joining hands with the rest of the world.Thanks to Brexit saboteur Phil Hammond, the path to those open seas is blocked by tank traps, landmines and treasury barbed wire.Hammond, aided by EU fth columnist Olly Robbins, is the panic merchant behind Project Fear Mark .Unless we accept Brexit In Name Only , abide by EU rules on trade and customs and bow to the European Court of Justice, we will starve to deathwe are not first eaten alive by rats. These are only “worst case” scenarios, you understand.More likely, we would prosper and flourish without a deal and, after a brief period of turbulence, wonder what this bitterness and recrimination was all about.Hammond, who loathes Mrs May and would have been sacked in a flash had she won her catastrophic  election, is now lead blues singer with The Remoaners.When the history of this bungled mess is written, he will emerge as principal villain, the Scrooge Chancellor who blocked every attempt to win a real deal from Brussels.He has waited until too late to unleash a few quid to build ferry and port infrastructure.His motive, shared by the hostage PM, is to drive home the fraudulent nightmares of No Deal at the expense of the national interest.Olly Robbins, a fan of Stalin’s Soviet Union, is the so-called Brexit negotiator who failed at any point in the last two miserable years to wring a single unwilling concession out of Brussels.History’s verdict will be harsher stillwe now end up bogged down indefinitely with BRINO, locked into EU coils without any of the benefits of actually getting out.Brussels doesn’t want us to leave — and they will make damned sure we don’t.The catalyst will be the day Mrs May actually signs off £BILLION to keep the leaky EU afloat while Britain remains shackled to a sinking ship.So far, this vast sum is merely a digital symbol with no immediate impact on the hard-pressed taxpayers who must pay.But once this cheque is cashed, reality will dawn with unpredictable consequences.For there is no magic £billion sitting in Treasury vaults. We would have to borrow it to bail out the EU — while struggling to pay our own bills here at home.Britain has little appetite for social unrest. For the moment, we can look across the Channel with bemused detachment as Paris is engulfed in flames.But .million people here voted for Brexit. They knew what they were doing.The same is not quite true of those who voted to stay.Many were reluctant Remainers. Some would have voted for Brexit, but for George Osborne’s original Shock and Horror. They know better now.They have seen ministers crying “wolf” too often.They don’t believe Theresa May, Hammond, the Treasury or discredited George “Six Jobs” Osborne.No Deal terries Brussels but it doesn’t scare waverers any more.Along with Tory MPs ing fortied by local supporters after the Christmas break, most are braced and ready for leaving the EU on global trade terms.Mrs May is banking everything on a last-ditch deal with Brussels over the Northern Ireland scam.Without it, she — or someone  — must tear up the cheque, hoist the sails and steer Britain out of the EU and into clear blue water.ENERGETIC Health Secretary Matt Hancock wants to make the patchy NHS world class.Here’s one good reason why he must.A friend with a skin blemish was booked for a biopsy in Chelmsford, Essex, last March.Months rolled by.So she paid out of her savings for a biopsy and then surgery after a specialist confirmed cancer and warned delay might have serious consequences.This weekend, NINE months later, she received a letter of apology and an update on her place in the queue for the biopsy.How many patients die before they get a letter like that Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The trial will start in July this year.After the trial is over, Ms Rudd will look at how it worked and consider best how to put everyone onto the new new flagship welfare policy.MPs need to vote to approve both the trial, and also on how to put the million others onto the new system.That meansyoure currently on benefits youre unlikely to move over to the new system this year.But Theresa May has said the programme is still on track to be done by  - with everyone on it.The news comes just after The Sun launched its Make Universal Credit Work campaign, demanding ministers make more changes to the flagship policy now before its too late.Weve told countless stories of how Brits are being pushed into debt waiting for their first payment, and have been forced to food banks and to payday loans.Ms Rudd revealed also revealed that the number of people who will be on Universal Credit will DOUBLE by the end of the year - as people naturally move over.This means thatyou have a change of circumstance - likeyou move home, your partner moves in with you, or you lose your job and have to make a new claim for benefits, then you will go onto Universal Credit.Ministers expect there to be another .million people who go onto Universal Credit in that way this year.And they wont be able to get any help with payments when they change over either, leaving many hundreds of pounds worse off.No, its just the process for people already on benefits which is being considered at the moment.Universal Credit rolls six benefits into one monthly payment, but the rollout has been beset with issues.Its now in every jobcentre in the country and is unlikely to be ditched altogether.MPs are worried about thousands of vulnerable and disabled Brits who could slip through the net and lose their benefits in the transfer.Others are urging the Government to transfer them over automatically, rather than make them sign up all over again.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told the Commons, said: I will want to consider carefully when I bring to the House the vote for the three million managed migration, which is scheduled for . Im still considering when to do that.She added: The , pilot as always, which was announced some time ago, informs us how we do that.Yes. In the last Budget Philip Hammond promised to increase the work allowances for people on Universal Credit by £, - allowing millions to earn £ extra every year from April this year.He also revealed:Theres lots of help out there for people who are already on Universal Credit and wont be seeing any changes anytime soon.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And as this carries on day in, day out, we see no nightmare queues of lorries backed up at our ports.In fact, there is no friction at all at the borders even though much of the “just in time” delivery we depend on comes from outside the European Union.We are not told the Civil Service is ready and prepared to handle a No Deal Brexit. This plan is being withheld from MPs and the British people in order to push Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement, which could bind us to EU control indefinitely.Make no mistake, Her Majesty’s Revenue  Customs are ready for a No Deal Brexit. All computer systems will be ready by January  and businesses have been advised about “Trusted Trader Schemes” to keep trade flowing.The EU has announced plans for visa-free travel and aviation rights.The French have installed high-tech scanners at Calais to keep both trade and tourism flowing.Friendly “Open Skies” agreements have been signed with our most important partners outside the EU — the US and Canada. We have agreed transitional trade agreements with Switzerland.There is so much to be optimistic about.As for our trade with the EU, that will not stop evenextra tarfs are slapped on our exports.The EU has a trade surplus of £billion with the UK.In , European countries sold £billion-worth of goods to us — that’s a lot of cars, food and wine they want to go on selling us.It is strongly in Europe’s interests to cut a deal.There are so many advantages of a No Deal Brexit. Number one, we keep our £billion — the cost of Theresa May’s deal. That is taxpayers’ money that can be used to boost British businesses.We will be free to enter into new trade deals. We are the fth largest economy in the world. The suggestion that we are too small to cut trade deals is nonsense.Australia, a much smaller economy than ours, negotiated deals with China, South Korea and Japan in just  months.Iceland has an agreement with China and its economy is tiny compared to ours. We would be free to run our economy as we wish, slashing red tape and burdensome regulation.Our friendships across the world with Commonwealth and other English-speaking countries can be re-energised. We have nothing to fear.The risks of staying in the EU, by contrast, are great.The EU has not been an economic success. Its love affair with bureaucracy and heavy taxation hold it back.Its growth rates since the financial crisis have been much lower than ours. Levels of unemployment are so high in some EU countries, no wonder young people there come to the UK where, at four per cent, we have the lowest level of unemployment for  years.As a hotelier, I can say without exception, it is much more dficult to do business in Europe than it is in the UK.The EU’s high corporate taxes, complex labour laws and tricky legal system make Britain’s low taxes and fair laws very appealing.There are so many reasons to be cheerful about our future outside the European Union.But Remainers are not able to provide any positive arguments for staying in.That is why they scaremonger with Project Fear. They won’t listen to the British people.They want to reverse the result of the referendum by almost any means.No one should believe their blinkered view and this country should not be held hostage by it.Britain has always been a world leader. We should not doubt that we always will be.A No Deal Brexit is the only way of ending the uncertainty and allowing us to get on with our lives as a successful, independent nation.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The lure of a food concession may encourage kids to take a little walk.The school has made a lot of effort to encourage healthy eating. We have problems with childhood obesity.Historically we had antisocial behaviour, not just motorbikes, from young adults gathering with alcohol and causing a disturbance.Anything that’s going to be a gathering place is likely to bring that back.

There is no other site to fit this description.“In Byzantine times, the historian Eusebius said that Kirjathjearim was nine or  miles west of Jerusalem, which this site is.“Also the name of the hill in Arabic – Deir el-Azar – preserves the name of the Byzantine monastery: the Monastery of Elazar.“According to the Book of Samuel, Elazar was the priest in charge of the Ark.”Along with his colleagues, Thomas Romer and Christophe Nicoll of the College de France, Professor Finkelstein has been digging at Kiryat Yearim since August  as part of the Shmunis Family Excavation.And though he has found no evidence of the Ark itself, he believes he can shed some light on its true nature.Kirjathjearim straddled the border of two ancient kingdoms – Israel to the north and Judah to the south – with excavations suggesting the site was used by the former to control the latter.Against this backdrop, Professor Finkelstein believes the Ark story was invented to give Kirjathjearim religious legitimacy as an administrative centre.It also emphasises a fabled past when the two kingdoms were united under a single ruler, further legitimising ancient Israels rule over its southern neighbour.Prof Finkelstein said: “We are not searching for the Ark. We are trying to understand the Ark Narrative: who composed it, when and why.“The biblical narrative probably comes from the Northern Kingdomand was seemingly composed in the first half of the th century BC.It probably served the ideological goals of the kingdom at the time, perhaps also its territorial aspirations, namely control over Judah.Lending weight to this theory is a huge  discovered at the site.He explained: Kirjathjearim was a typical hill country town, on a peak, with relatively steep slopes.But on the summit there was an elevated , which was probably the location of a temple.He believes Judah was too weak to have constructed the  itself and thinks the likeliest builder was the occupying Northern Kingdom.If he’s right, it would prove the kingdom’s influence over the site.The Arks whereabouts have long been the subject of speculation, with some saying it may have been melted down for gold, hidden on Mount Nebo, Jordan, or even taken to Africa.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He knows it is your final one and there won’t be any more forthcoming. But don’t worry. He has passed a motion. And the motion is clear. He completely rules out failing to do a deal with you.I have attended many boring political meetings and witnessed many fatuous ­political acts. Student meetings, tiny party branch meetings, national executive ­meetings of failing political parties, cabinet meetings of governments heading towards landslide defeats.And in all that time I have never ­participated in, indeed never witnessed, anything quite as fatuous or fruitless as voting to insist that we won’t leave the European Union without a deal. It’s not that I’m calm about the prospect of leaving without a deal. Or that I’m willing to support doing so.It’s just that not having a deal cannot be stopped by saying: “I’m against not having a deal”. It can only be stopped by ­agreeing to one.The Tory Nicky Morgan and Labour’s Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn joined ­forces on Tuesday to make it harder for the Government to let Britain leave the EU without a deal. Their motion was backed by a majority of MPs. But it still has three fairly obvious shortcomings.First, the Government isn’t in favour of leaving the EU without a deal. It agrees there shouldn’t be “no deal”. It has a deal. It is in favour of passing its deal. Second, the Government doesn’t need to be reminded about the damaging ­consequences of leaving without a deal.It knows what they are. Making it harder to prepare doesn’t make the ­Government keener to avoid no deal, because it’s keen to do that already.The third point is the most important one. Among those who argue that no deal must be avoided, there appears little agreement on what the alternative might be. The main sponsors of yesterday’s footling motion in the Commons are admirably open-minded but appear to have no idea how to win the majority of MPs around to their open-mindedness.I suppose these anti-no-dealers think they are warning Theresa May that,her deal is defeated next week, she has to come up with something . But this advice is only sensiblethere is an obvious alternative that stands a ­better chance of passing the Commons. Come on, really, what is that I’ll make a personal point at this stage. I believe that the referendum produced a legitimate outcome that Parliament has a duty to implement. It would be a grotesque failurewe were not able to arrange to leave.I’ve been against a second referendum all along. But even so, I insist that the departure should be orderly. I’m not ­willing to support a calamitous crashing-out, evenit means accepting the shame of failing to implement Brexit.Yet what do the anti-no-dealers offer to someone like me, who ought to be one of their natural supporters  Nothing except the frivolous message that they, too, are against no deal. And a perverse deter­mination to make an ­accidental no deal even worse than it might otherwise be.In those circumstances the only sensible position for me is to back the Prime ­Minister’s deal and urge Morgan, Cooper and Benn to do the same. Let’s look at the options once Mrs May’s deal is defeated in the Commons vote, as it seems it will be.There is the idea that she might be defeated in a no-confidence motion, lose the ensuing election and be replaced by a Corbyn government that negotiates a new deal. Except that a successful no-confidence motion is highly unlikely and there certainly won’t be a new deal, evenLabour got into power.By the way, the Labour Party is now toying with fighting an election, proposing a renegotiation with Brussels which would be followed by a public vote. In this vote, would they back leaving the EU  Or are they seriously suggesting they renegotiate a deal which they then urge voters to reject by recommending we stay in the EU after all Brussels would ­certainly want that. So you would have two sides negotiating a withdrawal ­agreement that both hope would fail. I think we can safely scrub that one off the list of sensible ideas.Next, there is the option of arranging to remain in the single market, in a Norway-style arrangement. This would require support from the Labour front bench to succeed because a lot of Tories would oppose it, evenMrs May agreed to it. But Labour has ­repeatedly resisted this idea. At the moment, a Norway-style deal stands less chance of success than Mrs May’s deal.A more realistic option is that ­Parliament supports a permanent customs union. Shortly after next week’s vote, members of the House of Lords will ­consider the Trade Bill.Peers will almost certainly pass an amendment to the bill, allowing Britain to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU. That creates a showdown in the Commons, where it is quite possible, given the strength of support, that the ­Government would have to agree.This would cause turbulence in the ­Government but, crucially, it would allow Labour to support Mrs May’s dealit wanted to — and to get it through the ­Commons. However, I doubt very much that it will want to. Labour only supports a customs union in which we get to decide on trade deals, which is not on the table.Then, of course, there is the possibility of delaying Brexit with or without a ­second referendum. Labour is still ­resisting this option and,it backs it at all, might do so in a form which is impossible to implement, such as ­insisting its own renegotiateddeal be on the ballot paper.In these circumstances, the chance of us accidentally ending up with no deal is very large. It is irresponsible to hinder any preparations we may need to make.We should be thinking harder about how to manage it. What side-deals do we need on things like air travel  Is there any way of agreeing a short transition   What physical preparations are in place Passing motions against such measures is worse than foolish — it’s positively reckless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There would be nothing parliament could do.The news today comes as:Under the fixed term Parliaments Act there cant be an early election unless two thirds of MPs vote for it, or the PM loses a vote of no confidence and fails to get another vote passed within  days.But its for the sitting PM to choose the day of an election.AndParliament was dissolved to get ready for a vote, it would mean they couldnt force her hand.The civil service would continue to run and the Government would carry on with getting ready to leave, with MPs powerless to stop it, the source told the paper.But several other cabinet ministers have said they wont support going for No Deal, and would quit the Governmentthat happened.Mrs May has privately told her top team that she would respond quickly with a statement to MPsher deal gets knocked down as expected next week.The PM vowed that Parliament would be able to have a say on what would happenthere was no trade deal with the EU in place by the end of .If that happened, Mrs May said that politicians would have a vote - they could opt to extend the transition period or enter the hated Northern Ireland backstop.This could win over a few MPs who are determined to vote her deal down next week.But there will be no legal changes to the deal, which EU leaders say is the best one available.The news comes after Labours Barry Gardiner confirmed Labour WOULD push through with a vote of no confidence in the PM next weekher deal was rejected by MPs.The frontbencher told the BBC: We are now talking asit is expected that the Government next Tuesday will be defeated on the most important piece of legislation that has come before Parliament in  or more years, that the government has taken two years of its time trying to negotiate and we are now almost expecting that this will be defeated and voted down.Obviously the next thing to do immediately after that is for there to be a vote of confidence in the Government.But later on Jeremy Corbyns spokesperson said he was just speculating about the exact timetable."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460694217.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit latest theresa may loses vote no deal","story":"Hopes that she can get next weeks deal passed by MPs are now fading fast after she was slapped down yet again by politicians demanding more of a say on our EU exit.The PM will now be forced to make a statement within three daysher withdrawal agreement gets thrown out by MPs on Tuesday as expected.The amendment, which was proposed by ex-Attorney General and Remainer in chief, Dominic Grieve, passed  to .It comes just hours after MPs voted in favour of limiting the Governments tax powers in a No Deal Brexit last night - another humiliation for Mrs May.Today MPs begin five days of debate on Brexit, which will end on Tuesday with the crunch vote.The news today comes as:So many MPs are still opposed to the PMs hated deal that its unlikely it will pass.After that, no one knows what the Government will do next.It could open the door to extending Article  - which Theresa May today dodged a question on - or even another referendum to keep us IN the EU.A minority government must expect to lose votes, its par for the course, Jacob Rees Mogg said today.He insisted that it was more symbolic than forcing the Governments hand, but showed the strength of the rebels.But  Keir Starmer MP, Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary said: If the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal is defeated next week, she mustto Parliament as soon as possible and give MPs a real say on what happens next.Just minutes before the vote took place a furious row broke out over the change, where Speaker Bercow was told he was biased for allowing the vote to go ahead.It was thought that the bill was unable to be amended, and No did not expect it to be allowed.But the Speaker stood up and told MPs that he thought politicians should get a bigger say on Brexit, and he was trying to do the right thing.Mr Bercow stood by his decision, telling the Commons: My understanding is the motion is amendable, Im clear in my mind about that.MPs said he broke Commons rules and ignored the advice of his own officials to push through the amendment.Crispin Blint said: We we will have an unshakeable conviction that the referee is no longer neutral.Angry Mark Francois shouted ridiculous! as the Speaker desperately tried to explain himself.Why are you overruling this today  he said.Fuming politicians said it was clear he was breaking long-established rules to make the ruling today.Commons boss Andrea Leadsom angrily demanded that he publish the advice hed got from his team on it, but he refused.MPs voted to accept an amendment from Dominic Grieve today which binds the Governments hands over leaving the EU.The crunch vote on the Brexit deal is scheduled for Tuesday, but Mrs May is expected to lose heavily.If that happens, she must come back to MPs with a statement within  days.But todays change cuts that right down to three days.The rebels say time is of the essence and theres not another minute to waste.Liberal Democrat Brexit Spokesperson Tom Brake said today: Parliament has rejected the Prime Ministers vain attempt to once again kick the Brexit can down the road and run down the clock.It is right Parliament has taken back control from a wayward Prime Minister and this failing Conservative Government.Earlier today the PM promised MPs a vote on whether to enter the hated backstop or not,we didnt get a trade deal ready in time.That would mean they could choose between that and extending the transition period further until a deal was sealed, and would avoid the Northern Ireland plans altogether.Shes also promised more say for Northern Ireland - including plans for a vote on whether they want to accept more EU rulesthey were to enter the backstop.But already the DUP has rejected the promises as meaningless."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000460718076.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow brexit sabotage ruling mps","story":"The Commons chief tore up long-standing rules to authorise a highly controversial vote by MPs, against his most senior official’s advice.He broke centuries of precedent by allowing a vote which hands MPs a chance to shape our withdrawal from the EU.

It will force Mrs May to announce her Plan B within three daysMPs vote down her Brexit deal next week. Why did his officials object They pointed to the long-standing precedent that government motions can be amended only by a government minister. Mr Grieve is a backbench MP.How was he able to overrule He claimed he was standing up for the rights and will of the Commons, declaring: “If we were guided only by precedent, nothing would ever change.”Why were Brexiteers angry They accused the self-confessed Remainer of bias which will thwart efforts to deliver Brexit.What does it mean Also during an another day of high drama in Westminster:While delighting the Tory rebels, the Speaker infuriated Brexiteers who insisted on grilling him for an hour in the Commons.One senior eurosceptic, Mark Francois, told him: “I have been here for  years and I have never known any occasion when any Speaker has overruled a motion of the House of Commons”.Refusing to sit down, Mr Francois went on to shout “sophistry” and “ridiculous” at the Speaker.As the chaos worsened, that sparked a counter attack from the Tory rebels, as veteran former Cabinet minister Ken Clarke stood to tell Mr Francois to “don a yellow jacket and go outside”, in a reference to Paris rioters.Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom also demanded Mr Bercow publish the Clerk’s advice, but he refused – insisting it was “private”.After a barrage of abuse, the Speaker finally admitted he had broken long-standing precedent to allow the amendment, but insisted it was only to “champion the rights of the House of Commons”.Saying he was “trying to do the right thing”, Mr Bercow added: “If we were guided only by precedent, nothing would ever change”.A total of  Tory rebels aligned with Labour to inflict the second Brexit defeat on the Government in as many days and the seventh in total.They included  former ministers, and were joined by all but one Labour MP to defeat the Government by  to , a majority of .Mr Grieve said the move is to stop No running down the clock for a no deal, with just  days to go until Brexit takes place.It came as MPs restarted a landmark five day debate on the Brexit deal on Wednesday.Under the previous rules agreed by all MPs, Mrs May had  days to come back to Parliament with a fresh optionher unpopular deal is shot down, as expected.Downing Street said it was “surprised” Mr Grieve’s amendment was allowed to go ahead, as that also contradicted their advice from clerks.But the PM’s official spokesman added: “Our intention has always been to respond quickly and provide certainty on the way forward in the event that we lose the meaningful vote, and that is what we will do”.But other Brexiteers insisted Mrs May could shake it off by simply doing the basic minimum.Leading Tory Leaver Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “The vote that the Government has just lost does not affect Brexit. It merely requires a motion to be tabled not even debated”.Mr Bercow’s decision to select Mr Grieve’s amendment was condemned by constitutional experts tonight, while even the former Speaker Baroness Boothroyd rebuked him.She questioned Mr Bercow’s integrity and even suggested he had been dishonest with MPs by using his officials as cover for the decision.Baroness Boothroyd - one of the most respected Speakers in the history of the Commons, blasted: “He put the clerks in an invidious position, he gave the impression they went along with him. He didn’t come clean with the House.“He should have been very honest with the House and said I have created a precedent. The onus is on me.“I was very sad as someone who has sat in that chair to see there were points of order, screaming at each other for an hour and a quarter.”Evan Paul Silk, a senior former clerk who wrote the authoritative ‘How Parliament Works’ book, said Mr Bercow’s move had undermined the entire ethos of how the Commons operates.He wrote on Twitter: “Predictability is essential in any rules-based body.“Parliamentary procedure should change, but unilateral action isn’t the way to do it.”He added: “Good outcomes do not justy bad means.”Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom also tore into Mr Bercow to say she was “very concerned” by his unprecedented action.The Cabinet minister told ITV’s Peston show: “My very grave concern is the role of the Speaker of the House of Commons is to beof the rules.“What happened today, the Speaker instead of beingof the rules, decided to unilaterally change the rule.”Sir Oliver Letwin, one of the Tory rebels, ended up negotiating in the Commons with Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary.Sir Oliver asked whether the opposition would work with the governmentthere was cross-party agreement on a customs union and single market deal, which is Labour’s stated preference for Brexit.Starmer later suggested that Labour would enter cross-party discussions “in the right spirit”Mrs May’s deal was defeated.Tory MPs were tonight plotting a fresh bid to oust Speaker John Bercow over his anti-Brexit bias.A group of backbenchers met to discuss how to force a vote of no confidence.It was one of a number of plots being discussed by Tory MPs over how to thwart the Speaker.Another motion proposed would dock ten per cent of Mr Bercow’s £, salary and cut his gold-plated pension - equivalent to half his salary after he steps down.And a third motion being considered would force Mr Bercow to publish all advice and communication between him and his officials over his decision to select the contentious amendment on Wednesday.Meanwhile former minister Crispin Blunt confronted the Speaker in the chamber as he told him his time was up.He told Mr Bercow: “For many of us we will now have an unshakeable conviction that the referee of our affairs, not least because you gave your opinion and your vote on the issue of Brexit publicly, that we we will have an unshakeable conviction that the referee is no longer neutral.“I just invite you to reflect on the conclusion that many of us will have inevitably have come to.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the move risks infuriating the EU as it flies in the face of the Brexit deal she has already agreed with them, which states the backstop must have no end date.No insisted Mrs May was still sticking to the spirit of the agreement as she would find another way to keep the Irish border openThe PM’s official spokesman said: “The focus of meeting the Withdrawal Agreement is to avoid a hard border. We would be in line with our international obligations”.The high risk offer failed to win round hardliners, who dubbed it “laughable” because Parliament cannot over-ride an international treaty, that would be the EU’s deal.Tory European Research Group deputy boss Steve Baker slammed the offer as “flimsy rubbish” that “will only persuade those who have decided to be persuaded”. Mr Baker added: “Most of us have made our decision on the Treaty text, which is what matters”.EU officials also dismissed it as a stunt.A senior EU diplomat said: “This is a purely internal arrangement in the UK. What counts is the treaty and the legally binding commitments in the treaty and why would the UK not want to honour its international obligations ”A bid to win back the support of the DUP also failed after its MPs branded new pledges on Ulster as “cosmetic and meaningless”.In a bid to assuage the unionists’ fears over the UK being ided up by the backstop, the Government promised the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto over any changes.But the plans were immediately thrown out by DUP leader Nigel Dodds, who insisted they don’t go far enough and the Stormont parliament has been suspended for the last  months anyway.Mr Dodds added: “The Assembly would not be able to override UK international legal obligations as the backstop provisions would be in the treaty”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s simply not viable, for so many practical reasons. There is a question of extension of Article  and that may well be inevitable now given the position that we are in.”Pro-EU Tories in the Commons immediately urged him to work on cross-party grounds to help break the deadlock. Earlier Austrian premier Sebastian Kurz conceded the EU would “consider” extending A to “secure” a deal with the UK.Sir Keir’s incendiary intervention came on the eve of a keynote Brexit speech by Mr Corbyn in Leave-voting Wakefield, Yorkshire today.Shadow Cabinet Ministers had already piled pressure on Mr Corbyn by saying Labour will have to “immediately” launch a no confidence challenge in Theresa May’s government the moment she loses her Brexit vote next Tuesday.Shadow International Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner had said: “We’re now almost accepting that this will simply be defeated and voted down. Obviously the next thing to do immediately after that is for there to be a vote of confidence in the Government.”Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said Mr Gardiner may have been “speculating”. He said it was a matter of “when not ” a confidence challenge is tabled.But he separately opened the door to Labour backing REMAIN in a snap General Election – given that it’s the Labour membership which helps set the manesto. He said: “We are committed to respecting the result of the referendum. What our policy in a General Election would be, would be decided by internal party democracy.”Insiders said Mr Corbyn would today step up demands for Theresa May to break the deadlock by calling a General Election. He will say that a Government with a new mandate can “negotiate a better deal for Britain and secure support for it in Parliament”.Pro-EU Labour MP Jo Stevens said Labour risked a catastrophic defeat with a pro-Brexit stance. And she urged Mr Corbyn to back a People’s Vote – in line with the conference motion passed at Labour conference last autumn.She said: “The time has now come for the leadership to implement the policy so we are unequivocally seen to take the side of the majority of Labour members, voted and the public at large.”Brussels has previously said it would only consider extending A in the event of a second Referendum or General Election.Speaking in Berlin, Sebastian Kurz said the bloc would consider it to prevent a No Deal. Amid rumours UK officials have been sounding out the EU on the possibility, Mr Kurz said: “At the moment, it’s all about doing everything to secure passage in the UK Parliament and the EU Parliament.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess. The insane pouting contortions of Candice “Bake Off” Brown during Celebrity Mastermind.The BBC somehow crowbarring an anti-Brexit dig into The Greatest Dancer.And Dee Dee Wilde calling her old Tena Lady troop, on the same show, Pan’s Fans, rather than the far more appropriate and eye-catching Pads People. Basic stuff, really.Steve Howey: “You need to have experienced that experience to have the experience.”And Phil Thompson: “All these City players are like for like. Even Danilo, who isn’t as good as Kyle Walker.”JUST when they thought we couldn’t send them anything worse than the potato famine, up pipes Last Leg Of The Year guest Sue Perkins with this Brexit bonus: “My New Year’s resolution is to try and track down a dim and distant Irish relative, so I can finally get that passport.”Andthere are any genealogists who can help, send the information to me marked “Generation Game: Urgent.”Knighthood’s in the post.Paul Ryan’s Farage cameo on Brexit: The Uncivil War.Clarkson not trying to be likeable, on Millionaire, which, ironically, made him very likeable.Bradley Walsh hating every second of his skye on ITV’s Breaking Dad.Simplicity Cremations’ perfectly-placed advert during The Last Leg Of The Year .And Billy Connolly, overwhelmed by love, on BBC, paying tribute to: “All the things that made me good and bad, Scotland.”Match Of The Day’s Jonathan Pearce on Alo Morata: “He needs to do that game in, game out to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”“They need to do that gay men, gay marriage to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”Sent in by Iain Milne, Newcastle. Picture research: Amy Reading.TV dramatists haven’t yet rewritten the result of Brexit.But, trust me, they will eventually. This is just the start of the softening-up process.Brexit: The Uncivil War, a Channel  production that toyed with neutrality, for about  minutes, but had given up any pretence long before the drama’s rather desperate postscript finally stopped trying to nudge viewers in the Remainer direction.The two main characters weren’t entirely subtle either.One, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was Dominic Cummings, the hi-vis dork who was in charge of the Leave campaign.The other, “I’M IN” leader Craig Oliver, whose portrayal, by Rory Kinnear, as a brilliant-but-tragic hero, was rather undermined by the fact Craig Oliver was also one of the drama’s political advisers.What saved The Uncivil War, though, was the acting, particularly Paul Ryan’s Nigel Farage turn, and Cumberbatch, who wasn’t a perfect fit for Cummings as his Durham accent slipped too often.It’s a performance brimming with such mesmerising charisma, though, I can genuinely see The Uncivil War effecting genuine change – two extra zeroes on Dominic Cummings’ next salary.Such is the real power of TV drama.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

MPs are deciding whether to accept or reject the -page Brexit deal the UK has signed with Brussels. Its widely expected the deal will be voted down, which raises the question of what happens next. Despite Westminster war-gaming obsessively for months, no one really knows how it will pan out. However, there are some things we know will happen, some that could well happen, and some outside choices. Heres what we know.   When is the Brexit vote  MPs are holding a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal from pm on Tuesday  January in the House of Commons. It comes after five days of debate, closed by a speech from Theresa May herself. The vote will be after pm, and could be some hours later, because amendments have to be voted on first. What does the Brexit meaningful vote mean  MPs are deciding whether to approve a Brexit withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU. The deal ensures there is no clf-edge on March  by carrying on EU rules in a transition period to December . It also commits the UK to paying a poundbillion orce bill infor guaranteeing we wont be locked out of EU arrangements. However, there is still no solution to avoid customs checks between Northern Irelandand the Republicafter . So the deal includes a backstop clause that,theres still no solution by , will trap the UK under EU customs rules. This will stop us signing trade deals with the rest of the world.   Will Theresa May win the Brexit vote  Probably not. More than  Tory MPs, and the Tories  DUP allies, said before Christmas they would vote against the deal. Because of this, the deal was delayed in order to win more concessions from the EU. But most MPs refused to change their mind because the EU refused to reopen the actual deal. Instead Brussels only gave assurances around the deal that critics said werent enough. What happens nextTheresa May loses the Brexit vote  Some or all of these options will happenTheresa May loses the Brexit vote. No Deal planning will be ramped up - and ministers will quit  Billions of pounds have already been spent on No Deal planning - and you can expect billions more. This includes turning the M motorway into a lorry park and spending poundmillion to boost ferry capacity across the Channel. A chunk of Acts of Parliament, plus more than  secondary emergency laws, will need to be rushed through Parliament. Thousands of extra border officers and Home Office officials are being hired to deal with extra paperwork. Several Tory ministers are expected to quit the governmentNo Deal Brexit starts looking inevitable.   Theresa May will be forced to reveal her Plan B The Prime Minister is expected to make a statement on the nightshe loses the vote. Her spokesman insisted she would move quickly and provide certainty on the way forwardthe vote is lost. By law she will be forced to come back to Parliament with a formal Plan B within three sitting days - so on Monday  January. She must make a statement on the governments next steps. After another seven sitting days - so by Thursday  January - MPs get a vote on those next steps. However, the vote may not actually have any legal effect. She might force MPs to vote again and again  Theresa May previously refused to rule out holding the vote on her Brexit deal again and again and againshe loses. She even refused to rule out holding the vote  times. That is despite her warning a second referendum on Brexit would damage trust in democracy. Technically there is nothing in law to stop her putting similar questions to Parliament to get the right answer. But MPs warned it would be a breach of vital parliamentary convention. Labour is set to trigger a no confidence vote Labour says it will force a no confidence vote in the government at some point after a defeat on January . Shadow Cabinet ministers said it would come immediately, but sources close to Jeremy Corbyn were more coy about the timing. There is a huge hurdle to Labour winning a no confidence vote. The DUP - whose  MPs are crucial to victory for both sides - has said it wont back a no-confidence vote unless the Brexit deal passes. But Labour are intending a no confidence voteit fails. So the best Labour can hope for might be for the DUP to abstain - in other words, not to back either side. If Labour does win a no confidence vote, it triggers a -day countdown clock. Andno one can command a Commons majority within  days... We could have a snap general election  A general election is triggered automaticallyno party can win the Commons confidence within two weeks. That could throw us into a campaign and vote on March  at the earliest - just weeks before we leave the EU. A new government would open up a whole new flowchart of possibilities, which we wont get into properly here. But it could well involve delaying Brexit and trying to renegotiate, especiallyLabour takes power. Remain MPs will push for a second EU referendum Remain-backers have already been pushing for a second EU referendum, and those calls will only grow. There is no majority for it in the House of Commons yet. But Jeremy Corbyn is facing pressure to back it from more of his members in the Labour Party. He has promised to leave it as an option on the table - in his view, a last resort -the deal is voted down. However, the exact path to a second referendum still isnt clear. And most say it couldnt be arranged in time before March . The date of Brexit could be delayed - or cancelled  Britain could extend the  March date of Brexit -the EU agrees to as well. There would need to be a concrete reason to do this, and itd probably be a short extension. Also, the EU is holding its Parliamentary elections at the end of May, which would get in the way - badly. Alternatively, Brexit can be cancelled without the EUs permission by revoking our notication to leave under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty. But while this is legally possible, dont expect it to happen under a Tory government any time soon. MPs will try to block a No Deal Brexit Pretty much the only thing MPs agree on is they dont want a No Deal Brexit. So expect them to pull out every trickin the book to try and block it in Parliament. Government minister Chris Heaton-Harris insisted there isnt a way to block No Deal. And thats true in the sense that No Deal is the default option, written into law. But MPs won an amendment that will force the government to seek approval for No Deal spending. In theory, MPs could try and use this to block it from happening. Theresa May could resign - and force a Tory leadership race  Theresa May could, in theory, be forced to quit by the men in grey suits of her Cabinet. That would spark a Conservative Party leadership contest. In this case, a new leader would take perhaps a month or two to choose. First MPs would narrow the candidates down to two then the , or so Tory members would vote between the final picks. The winner would become Prime Minister, without needing to call a general election, and could take Brexit in a dramatically dferent direction. Cabinet ministers could force Britain to choose another option If Theresa May faces undeniable pressure from within, or theres a new leader, there could be a new option for Brexit. Ones that have been mentioned include the much-discussed Norway option, staying in the European Economic Area. Remainers are largely in favour but Brexiteers say it would tie our hands and keep us bound to the EU. Andnone of that comes to anything  We leave on  March  with no deal.

The former Prime Minister enjoyed a sun-filled C holiday at surfers’ paradise Playa Hermosa. He hired a ft board for three days from Jackalopes Surf Shop. One worker said they were not sure who he was even after he signed a disclaimer. He said: “It was only because of his security we realised he was someone famous. We had to Google him.He seemed very relaxed and didn’t appear to have a care in the world.  “He surfed for about three days. He loved the waves out here.” The remote beach is a four-hour mountainous drive from the nearest airport but most wealthy travellers get helicoptered in.

Shadow Brexit secretary Sir KeirStarmertold MPs that the Governments handling of negotiations had placed the UK in a position where the only option may be to extend Article  and move the March  exit day back.The Labour frontbencher also said it was not viable for the UK to leave with no deal. Speaking in the Commons, Sir Keir said: There is a question of extension of Article  and that may well be inevitable now given the position that we are in, but of course we can only seek it because the other  have to agree. But he questioned whether the EU would have any appetite to renegotiate evenArticle  was extended.   He said: I have to say and, with regret, I genuinely think that the way the Government has gone around the negotiations has undermined a lot of the goodwill that otherwise would have been there. Sir Keir, on a no deal, added: I actually genuinely think we cant do it on  March this year. Its simply not viable, for so many practical reasons. The comment prompted the Father of the House Ken Clarke to ask whether Labour would work with Tory Remainers to ensure a form of customs union and sufficient regulatory alignment to keep open borders with the EU. Were going to have to have a discussion, I think next week starting after Tuesday about where we go next and were all going to have to enter that in the right spirit, Sir Keir said. Tory Sir Oliver Letwin echoed Mr Clarkes request, asking: Now Im one of those in this House who would like some way or another at some point or other in the not too distant days to arrive at some cross party agreement about something we could actually go forward with and therefore I ask him whether he could explain to the House what is a strong single market deal that would need to be delivered in order to get an agreement  Sir Keir replied: Is it possible, would the EU be interested in a discussion about what that sort of working customs union would look like, Ive actually had the discussion.   Independent Ulster Unionist MP Lady Sylvia Hermon later demanded to know why Sir Keir wanted to vote down the Withdrawal Agreement when it contained provision to protect the Good Friday Agreement . She said: Thatput an end to the appalling violence of -plus years in Northern Ireland where  police officers lost their lives, thousands of innocent people lost their lives in a terrorist campaign. Could he explain to this House and to the Irish diaspora in Labour constituencies how it is that the Labour Party is voting down this deal which guarantees theAgreement. Sir Keir responded: I dont think its fair to characterise anybody who says these two documents are not the right deal for our country on the basis that that is to undermine the Good Friday Agreement because that simply means there can be no criticism, there can be no issue, there can be no challenge to the Government and that cannot be right.

Now were told there could be one next week, meaning the country will go to the polls in March - just a fortnight before were due to Brexit.And there is almost nothing that could be a bigger disaster for him.For it to happen, there would have to be a massive swing against the government. Such a swing could happen onlythe country turned against Brexit something entirely possible, in this febrile atmosphere. Surveys have shown most UK constituencies now have a majority to Remain.If that happened, hed be the first Labour leader in almost a decade, handed a mandate to rip up the fondest dreams of his arch enemies on the Tory backbenches.A mandate backed just as strongly by Labour voters, .m of whom have switched from Leave to Remain. A majority of both Labour voters and paid-up members of his party also want a second referendum, and at the same time more than half of his partys members have considered quitting it because they oppose Brexit. Just four months ago the Labour Party conference backed a second vote - backed it, more importantly, with a standing ovation for Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer.And this week, , Labour members wrote to him ahead of a policy meeting this week demanding he do more to oppose Brexit. The Devizes Labour Party said people were resigning already and warned of a mass exodus. He is opposed to the Tory deal and last night, he voted to make no deal a financial impossibility.So as a democrat and a man of principle, as a politician and a humanist, and as a man who has opposed both Theresa Mays deal and not bothering with a deal at all on the grounds of the damage it would do, theres only one option left. Hed have no choice but to stop Brexit dead. Which would be awkward, because Our Jezza wants to Brexit with all his heart.  He has said the EU always suffered a serious democratic deficit and said it handed economic policy to an unelected set of bankers. He has complained about its free market, the business free-for-all, its limiting of national sovereignty and growing military co-operation. He voted against further EU integration, over and over again.He basically said a lot of the same things as Nigel Farage, but without holding a pint of beer or being invited onto Question Time.He has tried to change.After he became Labour leader, Jeremy wrote in the FT that we should remain in the EU and negotiate to restore our rights. And in , during a visit to Brussels, he told the BBC: The Labour Party is going to be committed to campaigning to stay in the European Union... when theres a Labour government in , we will be trying to ensure ... a Europe that is based on social justice and good, rather than solely on free-market economics.But he wasnt that committed to Remaining. He went on holiday during the referendum campaign and the evening before the vote held a hustings at Islington Waitrose. He couldnt have been futher away from the Labour heartlands which voted to Leavehe tried. The referendum presented him with the same problem as every other party leader - a large turnout, a small majority, and an instruction to not only deliver a unicorn but one that was red, white and blue.Labour, like the Tories, had its support split between Leave and Remain. Jeremy was presented with a tightrope along which he must tiptoe while appeasing two totally-opposed desires. His problem was made worse by the fact only one of them was possible, and he preferred the other one. But a few months ago his job became easier. Labour voters switched to Remain. His party demanded another vote. His activists want him to oppose. His MPs want him to present a firm alternative to Theresas mayhem. In such a situation, the electoral maths, Parliamantary requirements, and democracy itself combine to present one blissfully-easy path for any party leader to take - to Remain. He took the other one. Not the path that backs Brexit. No, Jeremy chose to stay on the tightrope. To take no sides and then to add immeasurably to his problems by asking to be given an utterly-impossible job AT THE SAME TIME. While trembling above a precipice, he has demanded the heavy burden of premiership be placed on his shoulders. To not only find a cure for the NHS, house the homeless, decide what to do in the event of nuclear war and authorise drone strikes on terrorists in foreign lands - which would be enough to keep Gandhi awake at nights - but to solve the insoluble problem of Brexit, something which has devastated the Tories like political Ebola.This is either stupid or heroic, depending on your objectivity. But take another step back, and youll see its a circle that even this messianic geography teacher is going to struggle to square.  Because as PM, Jeremy would have to do what he has said he will. And he has said pretty much everything. He has said remain, he has said Brexit. He has said renegotiate a better deal, while saying no more free trade. He has called for more responsive democracy, but wants to adhere to what the people said almost  years ago rather than what they say today.He has criticised the Good Friday Agreement, and as PM would be forced to defend it. He gets to dump on the DUP which everyone will enjoy, especially them, but to do so he has to say that supra-national trade, globalism and capitalism is the best way to be free.And to top it all, what hes most recently said is that even though weve spent all this time talking about how we will talk about a trade deal, we want to start again. Trade can wait, and Parliament can be shackled, for a couple of years more.Theresa might be a stupid woman, but I cant wait to see what the lipreaders see him being calledhe tries that.Of course, he might not be PM. He could be a victorious loser, again. On the Opposition benches he can holler and criticise without having to decide, andhis previous positions on Europe are anything to go by, not deciding is his favourite decision to take.Being PM means picking a principle and sticking to it. It means listening to the rest of the country, the party and the Parliamentary party. It means resolving Brexit the quickest and simplest way, so that Labour can get on with unpicking  years of tragic Tory rule.It means hard maths, and putting the countrys wishes before your own. And that is perhaps why he had no confidence in asking for a no confidence vote before Christmas, and why when a shadow minister said thered be one next week it was quickly defined as a personal opinion rather than a party one. Corbyns best interests are served, not by being PM, but by pretending he wants to be, and doing everything necessary to be PM except taking the final step, and filing the paperwork.The problem with that is your, and my, and the countrys, best interests are not being served at all.

If theres no Brexit deal by March , some documents will no longer grant you access to the EU - eventheyre in date. Thats because EU countries will demand you have at least six months left before your passport expires on your date of travel. That is dferent to the situation now, where you can enter France or Germany evenyour passport only has a week left. Here is the governments guidance for whether you need to renew.   Will my passport be valid after Brexit  British passports will carry on being valid to travel to the EU after Brexit. However,there is no Brexit deal, the UK will be counted as a third country after  March . That meansyou are travelling to Schengen area countries, you must have at least six months left on your passport from the date of travel.  The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. When should I renew my passport   The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. Will I have to pay to visit the EU  If there is no Brexit deal, you will probably have to pay for the privilege of visiting the EU. Short-term trips wont need a visa, but they will need a visa waiver. This is predicted to cost Brits € .  If there is a Brexit deal, the above advice does not apply. UK citizens will enjoy free, unlimited travel to the EU until at least  December , as long as their passports are in date. How will passports change after Brexit   The design of passports will change after Brexit. Passports printed on or after  March  will no longer have the words European Union on the cover. Then, later in , the colour of British passports will change from burgundy to blue.

She went on: “I would like to ask guidance from you Mr Speaker on how for example he might want to retract such a statement and alsothis is becoming of the sort of conduct we should expect from members of this house.”   Speaker John Bercow said: I think it was most unfortunate that was said.

Once it has been prised out, it is then slung into nearby trees. Secret cameras, planted by anti-hunt campaigners on New Years Day, shows a pack of hounds running past the scene once the fox has been removed from its den. The Hunt Saboteurs Associationclaim the video is evidence that supporters of the Kimblewick Hunt are involved in fox-hunting.   It is illegal to hunt and kill a wild mammal with dogs in England and Wales unless there is a valid exemption. The HSA say the incident has been reported to Thames Valley Police, which is investigating the incident.The footage was filmed in Moreton, near Thame in Oxfordshire, according to the HSA. They claim the video shows four terriermen discussing which way they want the fox to be released before using draining rods to force it out. Incidents like this prove time and again that hunts throughout the UK are still totally focused on hunting and killing live animals, said Lee Moon, spokesman for the HSA.   In recent years the South Herefordshire, the Middleton, the Pytchley, the Belvoir and now the Kimblewick have all been implicated in keeping captive foxes to hunt, showing that this behaviour is commonplace amongst hunts. Even with this concrete proof of illegal hunting, on one of the most high profile days in the hunting calendar, we expect the MFHA [Masters of Foxhounds Association] to do nothing. Unless they immediately suspend the Kimblewick it’s an admission that this kind of activity is still commonplace amongst their member hunts and considered totally acceptable in the hunting community.   A spokesperson on behalf of the Masters of Foxhounds Associationsaid: The Masters of Foxhounds Association has strict disciplinary procedures and will fully investigate any credible allegation relating to Masters, hunt employees or hunts. It cannot, however, investigate criminal allegations or take any action that would interfere with or impede a possible police investigation. A spokesperson from the Countryside Alliance said: All hunts should be operating within the law.There are exemptions to the Hunting Act, and other legal options, which can be used to cull foxes and most hunts still offer a fox control service.However unjustied the Hunting Act is it should be adhered to.  Foxes are members of the dog family, but they are the only type of dog capable of retracting their claws like cats do. Foxes also have vertical pupils that look more like those of cats than the rounded pupils that other dogs have. There are many dferent types of foxes, and they are the most widespread species of wild dog in the world.Foxes live just about everywhere – in the countryside, cities, forests, mountains and grasslands. A police spokesman said: Thames Valley Police is aware of the footage which appears to show an incident of fox hunting, which took place near Moreton Field Farm, in Moreton, Thame on  January. An investigation is underway. No arrests have been made.

Jo Collings, , says she made police aware of the monsters reign of terror but the media have instead accredited Emma Mills, another of the businessmans lovers. In the final episode of ITV drama Manhunt, which documented Bellfields killings, the focus was on Ms Mills. She was seen helping bring Bellfield to justice for Ameacutelie Delegranges murder in . Emma had called Bellfield the night he killed the French student, asking him to go to Tesco to pick up some milk shed forgotten to buy, butthe call had gone to his voicemail, transmitting to a mast covering the site of the murder.   It put the bouncer at the scene of the crime - and Emmas Tesco receipt from that night, proving she hadnt bought milk, was also used as evidence to cage him. But Ms Collings, of Berkshire, said: Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton has always saidI hadnt given a statement they would have got him eventually, but they wouldnt have known half as much as they did. That was the statement that was responsible for getting the ball rolling. The fact I had the biggest, major part in stopping him - its good.  She told The Sun : We [Emma and I] both went to court, we both gave statements, and between us we got him. Emma was involved in helping bring Levi to justice because of the shopping, but with Milly Dowlers case I was a lot more involved. Bellfield was charged with murder in , some six years after Millys abduction and murder in Walton-on-Thames. He was already in jail forAmeacutelies murder.

Perhaps I raised my voice just a bit at the time when I found out, but we celebrated with a cup of tea and a hug.”   Patrick added: “We really didn’t know what to do or how to react and we didn’t sleep a wink that night. We rang Camelot at am to very the win. “Then it started to dawn on us that it was true, even though it still hasn’t really sunk in.” As well as helping others, the couple, who have three grandchildren, have drawn up their own shopping list.

Frances has her eye on a second-hand Jaguar but insisted: “There’s no way I’m joining the jet set.” The pair also plan to buy a bungalow. They currently live in a rented house in Moira, Co Down.    Patrick said: “We are quite level-headed people. We are not overly extravagant – yet.” They had been considering moving to Croydon, South London, where Patrick had been offered a job as an operations manager, but he has decided to retire since their windfall. Frances, who previously worked as an educational programme co-ordinator, plans to do a PhD in clinical psychology. Asked whether she would have to increase her personal security, Frances joked: “I’ve never met anybody I couldn’t take down myself, to be fair.” She insisted the win would not change them but said deciding who will benefit from it would be tough.

Billy Rawlinson was amused to be accidentally invited to the group which had been set up to discuss the plans for Sandras th birthday, where he jokingly suggested male strippers and cocaine for the party. Unfortunately for him, one of the women in the group is a serving police officer so his suggestion did not go down well. Billy, , from Horrabridge, Devon, had been added to the chat as Lorraine after there had clearly been a mix up with the numbers.

The women, who are believed to be from the area of Luton, Bedfordshire, are understood to have been booking a party at one of the towns hotels.   One of the group unwittingly sent a message to Billy thinking he was Lorraine, and he was greeted with the message: Im booking th Feb for Leaside for Sandra please let me knowsuits everyone. I know Tracy it will depend on Issac. Billy, posing as Lorraine, replied: Im in. Not long afterwards, he decided to play a prank by asking: How many male strippers are we getting then  One of the ladies, oblivious to the real identity of Lorraine, replied: Lol none I hope ha. Billy then decided to really push the boat out, asking: Anybody able to sort any cocaine for it  One of the group asked: Are you serious  Billy replied: Yes, why not  The same woman responded: Because it is illegal. Im a police officer as well.   On Twitter, Billy posted the screen grabs with the caption: When you get invited to Sandras th by mistake with a laughing face emoji. The post was widely shared and it even got a response from Sandra. She replied to the tweet: Ok ok thatll be me soon to be the big  what a lucky boy you was to be invited to the event of the year. Wow all these retweets hope you all get me a present. Anyway made us oldies chuckle all afternoon. After being criticised for putting the womens mobile numbers online, Billy replied: I wouldnt of put your numbersI knew it would go viral, Im sorry!! Billy said: I just got added into it and thought Id have a bit of fun. I dont have a clue who they are. When asked what happened after the police officer replied to him, he said: They realised I wasnt Lorraine and kicked me out of the group. Im just glad Sandra was okay with the tweet but I should have blocked out the numbers. People on Twitter found the exchange amusing. One wrote: Im absolutely creasing.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are installing a pound, low-carbon energy unit at Frogmore Cottage, which will provide eco-friendly heat, hot water and electricity. The Grade II-listed cottage, on the Queens Windsor Castle estate, is said to be undergoing a multi-million pound refit which will be paid for by the taxpayer. The current five flats will be turned into one family home for the couple and their new baby, due in the spring. Other renovations, detailed in planning documents published by the local council, include a satellite dish outside, The Sun reports.  Harry and Meghan are leaving west London and moving into the -bedroom home to raise a family in a quieter setting amid alleged tension with Prince William. The Queen gted the couple Frogmore Cottage, which been a favourite royal hideaway for more than  years and is home to a royal burial ground. Kensington Palace confirmed the move in November, saying Windsor is a very special place for the couple.  The newlyweds will move into their main official residence early this year once the refit is complete. It is claimed that they had planned to move into one of Kensington Palaces main apartments, next to William and Kate, but there has been a bit of tension between the brothers. It is likely that it will get a full security upgrade to keep prying eyes away. Previously, the public could walk right up to the property, which was surrounded by a small fence with a sign reading Private. The couple currently live in their first marital home, a cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace in west London, where Prince William and Kate Middleton also reside.  Frogmore Cottage has more than enough space for the Sussex family and a nursery for their baby - and even a gym or a yoga studio - with  bedrooms. Formerly known as Double Garden Cottage, the home is set within Windsor Castles Home Park and faces the stunning and sprawling grounds of Frogmore House, which will no doubt become a more popular stop on the Windsor tourist trail. The cottage is currently ided into five units which were home to royal staff, but it will be transformed into a family home with modern amenities. Frogmore Cottage is set in an area that has sentimental value and many memories for the Duke, , and Duchess, .  Its half a mile south of Windsor Castle, the Queens summer residence, and St Georges Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Their wedding reception, hosted by the Prince of Wales, was held at Frogmore House, which was also where the couples engagement photos were taken. They reportedly had a summer picnic there in  before getting engaged. Frogmore House is in a peaceful and secluded location, surrounded by  acres of lush vegetation and Berkshire countryside.  The estate has its own man-made lake, Frogmore Lake, and is home to the Royal Burial Ground and the tomb of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Those interred at the burial ground include King Edward VIII and his we Wallis Simpson - the orced American socialite whose intended marriage to Edward sparked a constitutional crisis and led to his abdication in . Meghan is the second American orcee to marry into the Royal Family, but unlike Wallis she has been warmly received. Frogmore House was once home to Victorias mother, the Duchess of Kent, for almost  years. Her remains are also held there, in an elegant mausoleum. The House - built in the s and purchased by Queen Charlotte, we of George III in  - is open to the public just one month a year, in August, plus three charity open days in June.   The sprawling grounds allowed Queen Charlotte to indulge her love of botany, as the gardens, initially flat, were filled with , trees and many rare and unusual plants. Charlottes Vice-Chamberlain, Major William Price, and the Rev. Christopher Alderson of Derbyshire transformed the estate, creating the winding lake, wooded mounds, glades, walks and bridges in the Picturesque style. Tickets cost up to pound a person through the Royal Collection Trust. Inside, there are grand and elegant rooms - including one decorated by th-century flower painter Mary Moser. Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of George III and Charlotte, painted garlands in The Cross Gallery.  The Britannia Room is furnished with items from the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was decommissioned in . Watercolours by Victorias daughters, Princesses Victoria and Louise, are still in the House. Public access is extremely limited because Frogmore House, currently uninhabited, is still used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family as a retreat for private and official royal engagements. Frogmore House was built by Hugh May, Charles IIs architect, and given a name that refers to the abundance of frogs in the surrounding, low-lying marshy area.  It became a royal residence about  years later and has become a hideaway for royal couples and families, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and their children. Victoria was fond of Frogmores peace and quiet, and it is said to have been her favourite retreat, visiting during her long widowhood and working on her papers there. Frogmore Cottage was once home to Abdul Karim, Victorias Munshi, or teacher. A summerhouse in the form of a Gothic ruin and a teahouse made for Victoria are both still standing on the estate.  George VI and the Queen Mother honeymooned in the grounds in . In , it hosted the wedding reception of Princess Annes son Peter Phillips and his Canadian we Autumn. Last year, the Queen called it a wonderfully relaxing environment that holds a special place infamily’s affection. Harry and former Suits actress Meghan are currently residing at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.  Once they move to Windsor, their office will continue to be based at Kensington Palace. It is claimed that the couple opted for secluded Frogmore Cottage over a -room flat next door to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who reside in a -room apartment with children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. The Sun quoted an unnamed royal source, who said: The initial plan was for Harry and Meghan to move out of their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace and into one of the main apartments. But there has been a bit of tension between the brothers.Now Harry and Meghan don’t want to live next to William and Kate and want to strike out on their own.  The couple need more room and hope the Frogmore Cottage renovation will be complete before they welcome their baby, the source claimed. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move to Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate early next year as they prepare for the arrival of their first child. The couple have lived at Nottingham Cottage since their engagement last year. Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate. The Duke and Duchesss office will continue to be based at Kensington Palace. The Duke and US-born Duchess of Sussex will keep their country home in the Cotswolds while they reside in Windsor.

The Mirror understands the Government is likely to support an amendment put down by Labour MPs who could be open to backing her in the crunch vote next week. As many as  Labour MPs, most of them with Leave voting seats, could rally behind the Prime Minister’s planshe throws Downing Street’s weight behind the move. Bassetlaw MP John Mann told the Mirror that the amendment would make Mrs May’s deal “more attractive” and tackle key Labour concerns. Caroline Flint, MP for Don Valley, added: “Given the government cannot rely on the hard Brexiteers on their side, they have to reach out across the House to Labour.”   Earlier, Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer told MPs he had been surprised the Government had not approached him. “I actually thought at some point somebody would give me a ring,” he said. It came after another day of high drama in the Commons during which the PM suffered her second crushing defeat on Brexit in  hours. A cross-party group of MPs backed a rebel amendment, by  votes to , to force Mrs May to come back before them within three days to set out her Brexit Plan Bshe loses Tuesday’s vote. Downing Street admitted publicly for the first time that Mrs May was now planning for what happens nextshe is defeated in her ‘meaningful’ vote on Brexit. Ministers also offered new assurances to MPs that they would have more control of the controversial backstopthey backed her deal. It came as Commons Speaker John Bercow was embroiled in a furious row with Tory Brexiteers in which he was forced to deny being biased against the Government. He was accused of flouting Commons convention to allow the amendment from rebel Tory Dominic Grieve, designed to prevent the PM running down the clock towards no deal. The Speaker refused to saythe Commons clerk - an expert in parliamentary rules - backed his decision, and refused to publish advice given to him over the move.  No  sources said she planned to respond to any defeat immediately. Any new plan from Mrs May could then be amended by MPs - putting them in control of the Brexit process. However, the Government was pulling out all the stops to try to limit the scale of defeat. The Labour backbenchers’ amendment, tabled by Mr Mann, Ms Flint and Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell, would guarantee that the Government would enshrine existing EU protections into British law after Brexit. It would also mean thatBrussels strengthened those rights in future, MPs could decide whether to adopt the same standards. The protection of workers’ rights, health and safety, environmental protections are all key Jeremy Corbyn demands.One of Labours six tests on which it has judged the Brexit deal is: Does it defend rights and protections and prevent a race to the bottom  If the amendment is selected by the Speaker, Business Secretary Greg Clark is expected to announce that the Government will support it. Ms Flint said: “It’s about making sure we protect what we’ve got, but also making sure that MPs are able to take back controlthe EU strengthens rights and protections in those areas.” The former minister, who has previously suggested that dozens of Labour MPs could rebel against Jeremy Corbyn to back the PM’s deal as long as it is “reasonable”, said she hoped the Labour frontbench would back the proposal.   “I would hope this would get their full support because it’s one of the key points that has been made by the Labour in terms of how do you define a good deal.” She added that there were “a lot of other issues” around the PM’s Brexit plan that still had to be resolved before she was prepared to support it. But she added: “It doesn’t mean it’s the end of the debate.” Mr Mann admitted that the amendment would improve what Mrs May had offered on Brexit. “Does this make this deal more attractivethis goes through  Yes, it certainly does,” he said.“There are going to be other things as well needed, but this is one very signicant one.” He added: “It’s very encouragingGovernment is listening to what the people are saying but also it removes one of Labour’s objections. “In terms of trade unions, this is the big issue, along with jobs - that’s why unions have been very hostile to a no-deal. “The second is guarantees for workers’ rights and conditions. If we have a guarantee that works on workers’ rights and conditions, then that’s very signicant.” The Governments seven-page long blueprint for our future relationship with the EU, published in November, only briefly mentions that Brussels and the UK are determined to work together to safeguard workers rights and environmental protections - but is not binding.   This means there are no legal guarantees that everyday rights will continue in areas like paid holidays, rights for part-time workers, time off for working parents, equal pay for women and limits in working hours.Or,standards in the EU rise, they will in the UK too. The Government also confirmed it was accepting an amendment by Tory backbencher Hugo Swire which would give MPs the power to veto the Irish backstop and a transition extension in . It would also limit the backstop to just  months. A No  insider said: “This is not a silver bullet but this gives Parliament the opportunity to say loud and clear this is not an option we’re happy with and we’ll have to find another way through.” But they insisted that the UK would still meet its international obligations to the EU by some other routeMPs decided to assert their sovereignty.   The DUP, which props up the Tory’s fragile Government, put another obstacle in the PM’s path by rejecting her compromise plan before they it even published. The hardline party said that her reassurances over the controversial backstop to avoid a hard border did not go far enough. Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson said: “The only deal that could swing round the DUP isthe backstop as it applied to the UK as a whole or to NI specically were removed from this agreement.” Meanwhile, Tory former minister Nick Boles revealed he had received a death threat for the first time since joining a Tory rebellion against a no deal Brexit. He told the BBC that “sad cowards with nothing better to do” had made the threat after he joined forces with Labour to inflict another defeat on the PM last night.

Public Health England has warned that the sexually transmitted disease is resistant to antibiotics. Neither of the women had a personal connection or a link between sexual partners, experts revealed.According to the BBC , doctors fear there could be many other cases of the disease in the UK.Last year officials warned a Briton had contracted the “world’s worst ever” case of super-gonorrhoea. The case occurred after the man had a sexual encounter with a woman in south-east Asia.   But the two new cases are not linked to that one, medics revealed. Dr Nick Phin, from Public Health England, told the BBC: We tried to follow up contacts as much as possible, but it can be dficult - particularlypeople dont have details you can contact them with. It is possible there may be other cases, these are definitely the first two we have picked up and at the moment there are two. And Dr Olwen Williams, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said: We are deeply concerned by these new developments.   Both women were successfully treated for the condition in the end, despite drugs initially not working. A report by PHE warns that resistance to three of the key drugs used to treat the infection has grown, limiting the options to treat the disease. Medics have not revealed where they believe the condition was contracted, but said it could be linked to a party destination in Europe.   Last year, Public Health England announced that there were , new STD cases in , around the same number reported in . There were , diagnoses of syphilis, a  per cent increase compared with  and a  per cent increase from . The number of cases of gonorrhoea was up  per cent from , and the number of chlamydia tests had dropped by eight per cent. According to Public Health England, the groups with the most infections were young heterosexuals aged  to , black ethnic minorities, and gay, bisexual and other MSM \u2028. Dr Helen Fer, a PHE consultant microbiologist, told The : “Gonorrhoea can be seriousuntreated, with possible long-term health problems including infertility and pelvic inflammatory disease. The best way to protect yourself is to always use condoms with new and casual partners. Last year new cases of gonorrhoea increased by  per cent in England with many cases becoming more resistant to antibiotics.

Was I unreasonable to point out how popular the name is  I wouldnt have said anything bad about the name itself, but l didnt want her to regret her choice later, because she didnt know about the sudden spike in popularity. The woman has been inundated with replies on the issue, and most think she was right to say something. One wrote: I dont think you were unreasonable,its important to her that its unique then it’s worth her knowing its popular surely  I dont know why people care about unique names. Ive wanted to call a daughter Isabelle since I was about , and that hasnt changed now its popular. Another added: Since she specically said shed chosen it because of its uniqueness, I dont think it was massively unreasonable of you to mention it. If shed just said she liked it and didnt mention uniqueness being a factor, and youd said oh but its becoming more common now, maybe you should pick something  then I think that wouldve been more rude.

The Fast Radio Burstsare only a millisecond-long and were first detected in repeated form accidentally in , when a burst signal was spotted in radio astronomy data collected in . The new discovery reported in the journal Nature was made by a Canadian-led team of astronomers on the hunt for FRBs last summer. Most scientists believe they are generated by powerful astrophysical phenomena such as black holes or super-dense neutron stars. But a few have suggested more outlandish theories. Professor Avid Loeb, from the Hard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in the US, argues that they could be evidence of incredibly advanced alien technology. In last years discovery, the team detected  of the flashes using a new type of radio telescope, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment . Super blood wolf moon : How and when to see the lunar eclipse this month One of the FRBs was repeating. Of more than  FRBs detected to date, such repeating bursts have only been picked up once before, by the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in . Where the FRBs come from is not known although they are thought to emanate from sources billions of light years away outside our galaxy, the Milky Way.Chime astrophysicist Dr Ingrid Stairs, from the University of British Columbia, Canada, said: Until now, there was only one known repeating FRB.Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles - where theyre from and what causes them. Most of the  FRBs showed signs of scattering that suggest their sources could be powerful astrophysical objects in locations with special characteristics, the scientists said. Team member Dr Cherry Ng, from the University of Toronto, Canada, said: That could mean in some sort of dense clump like a supernovaremnant. Or near the central black hole in a galaxy. But it has to be in some special place to give us all the scattering that we see.   The new FRBs are are also at unusually low radio frequencies. Most previously detected FRBs have had frequencies of around , megahertz , but the new ones fell within a range below  MHz. In  Prof Loeb and Hard colleague Manasvi Lingham proposed that FRBs could be leakage from planet-sized alien transmitters. Rather than being designed for communication, they would more likely be used to propel giant space ships powered by light sails. A light sail works by bouncing light, or in this case radio beams, off a huge reflective sheet to provide forward thrust. Prof Loeb, who discusses the idea in a paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said: An articial origin is worth contemplating and checking.

A video taken in April  has been screened on Iranian state TV, coinciding with the -year-old saying she plans to start a hunger strike to protest poor treatment. She has been imprisoned for nearly three years, accused of spying. The documentary alleges that Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe - who was visiting family when she was arrested - is one of Britains main agents of soft warfare. Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, , was arrested at Tehrans Imam Khomeini airport in April  and sentenced to five years in jail after being accused of spying - a charge she denies.   The previously-unseen clip, which was taken with a hidden camera, shows her being stopped as she attempted to board a plane with her daughter Gabriella. An officer asks her: Are you going to London  After she confirms this is the case, Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was told that an arrest warrant had been issued for her, with an official telling her: You are banned from travel and you need to come with us to the prosecutors office, where the prosecutors assistant will tell you about your allegations and your problem will be resolved.   The camera captures her look of surprise at the exchange. This week her ordeal has been described as a matter of le and death. Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfes constituency MP, said tough rhetoric will not do anything to help her. MPs heard she is preparing to go on hunger strike after being given a ration of food, having calls to family restricted and being denied health care. She said: Nazanin has been given a ration of food which has slowly decreased.  Nazanin has been told the calls that she was allowed to make to her family and husband in London have now been restricted and will be further restricted. She said she believed Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt are absolutely determined to solve the case and found their pledges to help free Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe to be genuine. But Ms Siddiq added: The truth is this is a matter of le and death. Tough rhetoric will not do anything.  Mr Burt, replying for the Government, said there is constant communication with Iran over Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, adding: A request for diplomatic protection is still being considered as to whether or not this would add anything to the circumstances. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry described the treatment of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe as barbaric as she called on Iran to allow her release without any further delay. She said: This would be inhuman treatment of any prisoner, to pile this torment on an innocent woman whose medical and mental and physical health is already suffering is nothing but barbaric.

The couple, from Rome, who are also known as Nancy and Jack, have taken on permanent dominant and submissive roles in their relationship. After one year of trying to be what they call “vanilla”, self-proclaimed sadist Jack suggested that they change their power dynamic and incorporate BDSM into their everyday lives. Two years later, Nancy now wears a collar around her neck, signying her commitment to being a “slave” to her other half. She will complete any task or commands that he asks her to.   Her responsibilities as a submissive y from mundane to humiliating. She often is instructed to make tea for Jack and to clean his boots, but in more extreme cases, her mouth will become Jack’s “human ashtray” which he uses to stub out his cigars. Aspiring fashion designer Nancy, who insists that she is not submissive with anybody  outside of her relationship, also says that BDSM has helped her to overcome her long-term struggle with bulimia. She said: “I always liked food and I liked eating but I thought it was wrong and it made me dirty. “I had a desire to regain power over my body, the pain I had caused to my body was not a pain I wanted.   “I’m in a relationship in which finally I could let go of myself and give the responsibility to someone , because I see that on the other side there is someone who can help me, can put me straight.” By taking on a submissive role, she gives Jack control over her everyday choices, including her eating habits. Jack, who works as a cheesemonger in a food store, said: “Trying to force someone a diet that has a bit of balance has been a big part of our relationship. “  [BDSM] also means trying to put boundaries in each other’s lives, not only to sustain them, but to reach a state of peacefulness for the couple.” Not only is the BDSM involved in their daily lives, but also in the bedroom. As Jack enjoys “impact play” and Nancy is a masochist, she will allow him to slap, kick and flog her.This often leaves giant bruises across her body and she says that she is sometimes left so swollen that it can take her up to three hours to get undressed. Jack said: “I am very rough. What I can find at hand is fine, even chairs work.   “Let’s just say that Mike Tyson would have issues knocking her down at times.” They also use ropes to restrain Nancy, which she says is “deadly practice”. She said: “I know a lot of people who had incidents because they didn’t have enough attention and went to the hospital. In three years we haven’t had an incident because we have been super careful.” Although they’re in a monogamous, romantic relationship, Jack admits that he prefers to involve BDSM because he struggles with conventional expressions of affection. Jack told Barcroft TV: “I’m not good with cuddles or things like that. “I prefer caressing someone’s cheek after I have given them on a slap on the face.   “She’s the one who’s affectionate. I can only be nice when I have killed her with hits. Nancys family are unaware of their lestyle and so they need to be careful about where she receives hits.But the couple insist that it’s all consensual – their safe-word is “Winnie The Pooh”. Nancy added: “Sometimes people think that I am the poor victim, abused. “He’s the master but I choose the pain. I decide when to feel pain, how much pain, and most importantly I like that pain. “For me, it’s nice that he’s feeling comfortable and feels like he can do whatever he wants with me. Jack said: “Even though it might be fun to be sadistic, it is onlyon the other side there is a masochist who enjoys seeking them.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/Dundee-and-Angus-College-sOld-Glamis-Road-campus-stock-image.jpg ","title":"all classes called off at dundee and angus college due to strike","story":"All classes have been called off at Dundee and Angus College due to a strike.Teaching staff are set to take part in a day of industrial action on Wednesday, January .No classes will take place at Dundee and Angus College campuses on the day.A statement from the college reads: “Due to industrial action by teaching staff on Wednesday  January  all classes will be cancelled.“DA College campuses will remain open for independent student study or other inidual arrangements that staff may make with their students.“The Arbroath Campus Open Day will go ahead.”"},{"url":null,"title":"blether dundee boss bob shankly motored to aberdeen to sign john scott","story":"Jocky Scott is, rightly, a legend at Dens Park.

Not only was Macca a popular player in his five years at Tannadice, he also had the knack of scoring against Dundee in derbies.Even so, when he was appointed in October, there was barely a murmur of discontent over his United connection.Many others have been on both sides of the street at one time or another and been welcomed by the punters.Going direct from one to the other has not been uncommon either and, strangely, the only time there has been a fuss was with a transfer that was proposed but didn’t quite happen.That was back in the   season when both clubs were down in the old First Division and cash-strapped Dundee accepted a six-figure bid from United for their exciting young winger Neil McCann.When news of the proposed deal leaked out, however, such was the furious reaction from Dark Blues fans, the board had to call it off and, a short time later, McCann, until recently manager, was instead sold to Hearts.At other times, though, players have crossed the street with barely a whisper of complaint.It should be said that was often because the ying fortunes of the teams meant there was little the one losing one of their squad could do to prevent the move.Equally, there have been instances where fringe players at one team were allowed to go. The most notable of that second category came when Tommy Coyne headed to Dens from Tannadice in .Signed by the then-defending champions from Clydebank in  for £,, Coyne could never quite make the breakthrough into Jim McLean’s side.That meant when United’s greatest-ever manager allowed him to head for Dundee, three years later and for £, more, the bigger gamble being taken seemed to be the one by Dens boss Jocky Scott.It proved to be a masterstroke on his part and, not only did Coyne score  goals in just over  appearances, when he left for Celtic in  it was for a whopping fee of around £,.A success heading in the other direction was the Tele’s own Lee Wilkie, who joined boyhood heroes United from Dundee in .Big Lee went on to lt the Scottish Cup in , although by that time he had been sidelined by the knee injury, ironically first suffered in a derby while playing for Dundee, that would end his career.In terms of medal success, Iain Phillip stands as the only man to win a major competition in both dark blue and tangerine.The defender-cum-midfielder was part of the Dundee side that shocked Celtic in the  League Cup Final and, after ending his second spell at the club by joining United in , got winner’s medals in the same competition in  and  – the latter when he started against Dundee in the final at Dens Park.Others to have moved directly from one to the other include Albert Juliussen, Ian Scott, Billy Williamson, Bobby Robinson, Neil Duffy, Beto Naveda and, more recently, Scott Robinson and Paul Dixon, who departed under freedom of

the focus on Robbie Neilson recently has been on who he’ll be signing in the January transfer window.Since his arrival in October, however, the Tangerines boss has repeatedly stressed the need to make room for young players already at the club to make the breakthrough into first-team football.Over the past few weeks he’s shown that’s more than just talk by including young attacker Matty Smith in his starting line-up on a couple of occasions, including for last weekend’s Tannadice draw with Partick Thistle.The -year-old, who’s been hovering on the fringes of the first team for a couple of seasons now, is both grateful for that opportunity and determined to make the most of it.“The manager said to us when he first came into the club that he would give the older lads their chance but he said us younger ones would get theirs as well,” said Smith.“For me it’s good he’s done that. He brought me into the team against Inverness last month and again against Thistle on Saturday.“After Inverness I had a wee while out because of illness but he’s brought me back in again and I enjoyed it.”Despite his tender years, for the Dundonian having to impress a new manager at United is not something new.Such has been the turmoil there since he was first signed up that he’s had more gaffers than many players come across during the course of their entire careers.“I think it is about seven managers I’ve had here now and I’m only , so there have been a few. It is tough because I’ve never had a manager who has brought me into the team and given me a run of games. I’m glad the manager has given me my chance now and it’s up to me to take it.“He had been great with me, he speaks to me in training and it’s been good for me.“There a few of us young boys, some even younger than myself, that can get a chance.“The manager will also bring a few more new players in as well during this window because it’s not really his squad yet and we’ll see what develops.“He’s played me out wide. I’d like to play in the holding role in the middle because I’ve played there as well but, even though the manager has started me on the wing, he wants us to come into the middle and get on the ball there.”Smith has performed well under his new boss at a time when United have been struggling to maintain the momentum they were building shortly after his arrival.The youngster admits that’s been frustrating but believes United are not far away from ing to winning ways on a regular basis.“Saturday was very frustrating. After Ayr and Ross County dropping points we were looking to get a victory but it wasn’t to be.“Partick came at us first half to be fair to them. I thought in the second half we were very good and we can, hopefully, take that into this week against Dunfermline.“There are no bad teams in this league and, at times, you just need to battle it out in games.“We did that in the first half and I think in the second half we showed up better.“We got the goal back in that second half and then had a lot of chances to win the game, we should have been more clinical and finished them off.“We need to keep grinding results out.

It’s phenomenal.“They’re like children in a sweet shop the way that they attack them.“It’s the nutrients in the bark that they love so much, because trees can pick up some trace minerals from the ground that grass and other things can’t.”Specialising in rare breeds, Sarah chose to get bagot goats – one of the rarest in the UK with only around  left in the country – in a bid to clear weeds from her fields.Sarah has been caring for rare breeds for more than  years, in a bid to preserve them for the future.She is on the hunt for real trees that have been used over the Christmas period, but that haven’t been sprayed with anything such as fake snow or articial pine scents.Trees that have been kept close to kitchens will also not be accepted, because of the chance of contamination with food, which could cause an outbreak of foot and mouth.For Sarah, asking for the trees was an easy decision, especially as there is currently a hay shortage.She said: “There’s a huge waste of trees around this time of year, it seems criminal – especially this year when fodder is in such short supply, because a lot of the silage and hay has already been used.”This is the third year Sarah has recycled trees and she has been kept busy trailing across the north-east picking up trees from people.She said: “It’s been absolutely fantastic, I’ve even had some of the village trees that have been standing out in the squares. They’re fantastic because they’re usually quite green.“It’s been a great response from the local community.”Despite the fact the goats don’t eat the wood of the trees, Sarah manages to find a use for it, whether it be for kindling for her wood burner, or passing it on to a lady in the village who makes wooden children’s toys.She said: “Every part of the trees I get is used in some way.“The things I can’t burn, I put out the back to rot for the insects.

Other weight management programmes can be effective in terms of helping people who are severely obese lose weight and are cost-effective for the NHS.”The research also revealed that adding a very low calorie diet to an existing weight management programme was shown to not be a good use of NHS resources.But most weight management programmes, including those with very low calorie diets, appeared to be a good use of NHS resources compared with doing nothing at all.The best result for long-term non-surgical weight loss – over nearly  years – came from an intensive plan with a low-fat diet, having a calorie goal, initial meal replacements or meal plans and lots of exercise.Professor Avenell said: “Obesity is a rapidly increasing, worldwide epidemic. Despite recent scientic advances, no recommended dietary program or medication results in long-term weight loss of more than % of body weight for the vast majority of people who attempt these interventions. Hence, surgical intervention is recommended for patients.”Increasing physical activity to prevent long-term weight regain, and receiving longer-term help with diets or using the drug Orlistat, were also found to help keep weight off.Meanwhile, Aberdeen nutritionist and author Scott Baptie said: “Aside from confirming that surgery is an effective weight loss treatment, this study has also reiterated the importance of following a ‘high quality’ weight management programme when trying to lose weight.“There’s no shame in having weight loss surgeryyou deeply feel it’s the right choice for you.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/49512269_308491203343090_6053366051314335744_n-e1547071943861-128x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"worst of wind over as met office record gusts of 60mph in north east","story":"Windy weather was set to continue today as gusts of more than mph were recorded.Experts from the Met Office said high winds would continue to hit the north-east but the worst was over.Yesterday the biggest gust was recorded at Peterhead Harbour at mph.A spokesman for the Met Office told The Evening Express some of the strongest winds were recorded between pm and pm.He said: “It will be windy again this morning but it won’t be as bad as the weather warning ends at am.“It will continue to be windy across the east coast of Scotland as well.”SEPA warned of potential high waves into today.Strong winds forced the cancellation of the NorthLink ferry sailing from Aberdeen to Lerwick last night, as well as the ferry sailing in the other direction which was due to arrive in the Granite City today."},{"url":null,"title":"young red star bucks outfox legends in christmas cracker","story":"Bruce WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHaving not played a game in six weeks, Red Star s faced a dficult challenge on Thursday December  in a charity game against a local nae hair grey hair select.In a playful match, the youngsters of s were against their greatest competition: parents.An entertaining game ensued which resembled the great Real Madrid v Eintracht Frankfurt European Cup Final# only in that it too was played on grass.The nae hair grey hair select were looking to use their experience with the defence having a combined age greater than the whole  team.To counteract this, the s included coaches Brown, Caskie and West to double the age # and probably the weight # of their team.The select started well spraying passes about the park, though to be fair they were mainly bus passes.The s took the lead when a toe poke heading for a throw-in was deflected past the select keeper.

And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"iceland plans new ayr store","story":"NewsIceland plans new Ayr store as Food Warehouse makes application to open at Heathfield Retail ParkAn application has been made to occupy the former Homebase unit at Heathfield, which was vacated last year.ShareBySarah Hilley:,  JAN NewsThe vacant site at Heathfield \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIceland’s new Food Warehouse store is lining up to open in Ayr.

Fast-growing Home Bargains sells budget toys, household and beauty products, among other goods. The Food Warehouse has a bigger grocery choice than Iceland as well as bulk buys.

The document added: “The prospects of securing a bulky goods retailer to occupy the whole unit are extremely limited. “Sub-ision of the unit is the only viable option to secure tenants.” Ediston is waiting for a decision from the council on whether food can be sold from the space. The firm has also applied to allow homeware goods to be offered at the plot as part of the Home Bargains proposal, which has yet to be decided. Home Bargains would take up a floorspace of , square feet and the Food Warehouse would span , square feet. Ayr Central owners MG Real Estate objected to the proposals to alter premises conditions at Heathfield. A supporting statement on the Food Warehouse plan dismissed the shopping centre as a possibility. It claimed that “Ayr Central has no units available that could accommodate the proposal.” The document also ruled out the former BHS site on Ayr High Street and the Kyle Centre. It said: “The former BHS unit is the only unit available with any sizeable floorspace but this is too large and would require signicant redevelopment and sub-ision to create a potential unit that may be suitable to the occupier.” Wren Kitchens is a recent addition to Heathfield, along with Poundland.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream.

She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"300k-up-for-grabs-with-new-localities-fund","story":"COUNCIL bosses will open up applications once again for a share of a pound, community pot.The Localities Bid Fund proved popular in  when  dferent groups and organisations shared more than pound, for projects across the region.But a tightening of rules for the second round earlier this year led to the scheme being postponed due to a lack of applications.Following a further revision of the rules at Newtown St Boswells, Scottish Borders Council will once again invite applications from Monday, January .Councillor Sandy Aitchison said: \"This remains a great opportunity for local communities to take forward projects that can have a positive impact in their town or village.\"Members of the public will vote for the ideas they want to see delivered and I hope we attract a good number of bids for them to choose from in each of the five localities in the Borders.\"The new relaxed entry criteria doesnt restrict applications to just new projects.The cap has been raised from pound, to pound,, staffing costs of  percent of the total application will be considered, and structural changes to buildings will now be considered.Applications for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos Localities Bid Fund will be accepted until pm on Thursday, February .Application forms and guidance are now available at www.scotborders.gov.uk LocalitiesBidFund"},{"url":null,"title":"christingle-magic-in-ettrickbridge","story":"MORE than  years separated the oldest and youngest members of the congregation at the Christingle Service in Ettrickbridge on Christmas Eve.Ettrick and Yarrow Valleys Churches held their traditional family service at Kirhope Church.A truly family affair with the youngest being just seven weeks old.And despite the energetic singing of the traditional and modern carols and hymns, slept peacefully throughout.The entire congregation who took part, made their own Christingle as part of the service which ended up with the church being filled with the candle light at the end of the service.The service was introduced by Rev Jim Wallace who described the service and the wonderful singing as fab-u-lous.Music was provided by Andy Wright and the Service was led by members of the congregation.The beautul Kirkhope Church was especially floodlit for the service to create a wonderful Christmas atmosphere which was added to by the mulled wine and shortbread."},{"url":null,"title":"could-this-become-the-schooly-mcschoolface-campus","story":"A JOKE suggestion is leading the way in a bid to name the new school campus in Jedburgh.Scottish Borders Council began inviting suggestions for the official title of the intergenerational campus the week before Christmas.The suggestion by James Keiller on the local authoritys social media site to call the campus Schooly McSchoolface is so far the most popular by a long way.Education bosses were hoping to gather suggestions linked to Jedburghs historic past as well as the towns famous folk.And they plan to draw up a shortlist of the most popular and appropriate names to go out to public vote next month.But in the week or so since they opened up to suggestions it has been Schooly McSchoolface which has attracted most support.The name is a take on Boaty McBoatface, which was the name given to a new Natural Environment Research Council vessel after a similar public vote in .Although not being drawn on the current leading candidate, education spokeswoman councillor Carol Hamilton hopes there will be many more suggestions ahead of the January  deadline.She told us: \"We have already had some great ideas for the name of the new campus, and would love to receive more ahead of the deadline.ldquoWe realise how important this project is to Jedburgh which is why a public vote will be held to choose a winning name of this exciting community asset.ldquoWe look forward to further engagement with the community on this project next year, which will see this innovative facility move closer to completion.Work on the new campus is progressing well, with the frame of the new building -

which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred.

Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-cameron-leigh-griffiths-gets-my-sympathy-but-why-does-he-make-his-life-so-damn-difficult","story":"Itrsquos luck, really, which allows us to show the world whatever our inidual talent handed out at birth happens to be.For example, had I been raised in the Amazon Basin instead of directly across the road from a pub, would my genius, the right word, trick of flicking up a beer mat and catching it with the same hand before it hits the table ever have been discovered There are a select few blessed with such incredible talent that it elevates them above almost all of the rest, an ability which even in an elite field marks them out as someone truly special.Leigh Grfiths is one of them.This is someone possessed with a ridiculous amount of natural talent for kicking a ball with a left foot which could double up as a wand. He should have been one of Scotlandrsquos all-times greats.Many years ago, I took a trip through to Edinburgh to write up a feature on Hutchison Vale, the football club which boasts a ridiculous number of ex-players who went onto play professionally.John Collins, Darren Fletcher, almost everyone who has ever played for Hibs, and Allan McGregor are just some of the graduates. The list goes on and on.While there, I asked who was the most naturally gted player to ever darken the door of Hutchie Vale, thinking it would be Fletcher. The answer I got has never left me.A coach said that it was the young lad who then had only just broken through at Livingston, and was scoring goals for fun, who beat Collins and Fletcher, two modern greats of Scottish football.It was put to me Leigh Grfiths was the best that club had seen but there was a problem. He was something of a lad. Easily led and prone to distraction.And Irsquom putting it mildly.Just the other day someone I respect in football said to me that Grfiths should be playing for a team at the top of the English or German league. Hersquos that good, this man said and he knows what hersquos talking about.But with Grfiths there is always a but.He denied this week he is a gambling addict, insisting his problem is with mental health issues. If this is  per cent true, and I suspect it is not, I sympathise. I suffer from depression and know how much it can affect the le of anyone. I wish him well.But ndash that word again ndash this fragile and complicated character who while deserving of our best wishes is really pushing Celtic. I am beginning to think hersquos played his last game for the club.Grfiths has been warned time and again to live properly, live better, get fitter, and to an extent he has done. But itrsquos not nearly enough.He should not have been at a Newcastle Racecourse in a bight red lsquolook at mersquo jacket seemingly putting on bets. He shouldnrsquot have been posing for pictures. Not right now, not when he is off for ldquoongoing issues while being paid handsomely by his club.It may seem like Irsquom kicking a man when hersquos down, please believe me thatrsquos not the case, but the last thing someone in his position needs is more hassle, which of course he got online. He responded which only added to the initial regrettable headlines.How many chances is he going to get  Not every penny has dropped. The heid has never been fully screwed tight. The next piece of silliness was never far away. Itrsquos ashersquos as good at self-sabotage as he is at scoring goals.Grfiths is troubled but has a good heart. Itrsquos just that he is man seemingly incapable of dragging himself clear of chaos. Hersquos the pal who can get into an argument and then a fight while putting out a milk bottle. Trouble finds him and this now -year-old has to take a lot of responsibility for that.Grfiths loves Celtic. But maybe it is time for him to leave. Neil Lennon and he get on well and it seems to me that a move to his beloved Hibernian might be best for all parties.This guy could have been anything.Therersquos still time for this natural born goalscorer to, for the umpteenth time, show all of us doubters how wrong we are.

Having bonded with Cave and guitarist Roland S Howard, this time Reekie made sure he had his camera.More than three decades on, some of the photographs he took that night and over the next few years in London and Berlin can be seen for the first time in Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn, Reekiersquos -page zine-like collection belatedly launched next weekend at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow.ldquoLooking at the pictures again brought a lot back to me, says Reekie. ldquoI can remember the chaos and the aggression of the shows, but not any aggression in the people. I was really surprised to find everyone in The Birthday Party was so articulate, well-read and literate, and yet onstage it was almost like everything was stripped away to the most basic bones of absolute nihilism, and almost hatred for the audience. They got into a lot of fights that I witnessed, but after the show once things had calmed down, they relaxed with a bottle of bourbon, and you could chat with them about James Joyce or Dostoyevsky.The idea for Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn came after Reekie put some of his hitherto unseen archive on social media, and was approached to contribute to an exhibition in Los Angeles called Nick Cave Smoking. Reekie submitted four prints, one of which sold for . As Reekie puts it, ldquoIf someone in LArsquos willing to pay that for something Irsquove just got lying in the cupboard, maybe I should think about doing something.ldquoIrsquove always thought of doing an exhibition of my archive, but never got round to it. The book has already travelled as far afield as America, Japan, Poland, the Czech Republic, Bosnia, Scandinavia and Canada. Itrsquos never going to make me a millionaire, but I feel quite validated by that.Reekiersquos images capture an unguarded sense of ease amongst Cave and co, with the band captured backstage making their own mark on the back of a torn-down Sad Cafeacute poster. Despite a strung-out demeanour that foresaw the self-destructive effects that heroin would have on the band, there is a sense of camaraderie at play, with Cave and Howard in particular looking like brothers in arms. It was a bonding perhaps caused by the absence of bassist Tracey Pew, who was serving a prison sentence. This necessitated Howardrsquos brother Harry stepping in.ldquoIt was chaotic, says Reekie. ldquoHarry had never played onstage before, and you could tell that Mick Harvey, as the only non-drug taker in the band, was trying to keep everything together.Later images reveal a haunted-looking Howard captured with his post Birthday Party band, These Immortal Souls. Elsewhere, a now solo Cave looks increasingly messianic. While Pew was dead by the end of  and Howard passed away in , one of Reekiersquos fondest moments is of offering Howard, his then partner Genevieve McGuckin and These Immortal Souls a bed in his flat following an Edinburgh gig.ldquoI went through to take Roland and Genevieve tea in the morning,rsquo says Reekie, ldquoand they were both sitting up wearing matching silk pyjamas, and were so polite in a way that no Birthday Party fan would believe.Sadly, no pictures of this myth-busting incident were taken.While he continued to take photographs, Reekie went on to become a music journalist of note, writing for Esquire, GQ and Loaded after that side of his career was kicked off in s Scottish music magazine Cut. The cover image of Reekiersquos book was taken in the Groucho Club, where Cave held court about his newly published novel, And The Ass Saw The Angel.ldquoThat was my first cover feature for Cut, Reekie remembers. ldquoI wanted to do the photographs for it as well, but they got Gavin Evans to do them.Sometimes Pleasureheads Must Burn is the first in an occasional series of photobooks produced by Stereogram Recordings, which have released albums by the likes of The Eastern Swell, James King and The Lonewolves and The Cathode Ray. It is also the latest example of an ongoing unearthing of photographic archives from a pre-digital age that document often hidden histories of the post-punk era.This came to prominence in  with What Presence!, an exhibition and book of lost images by Glasgow-based former Sounds photographer Harry Papadopoulos. Produced by Street Level, What Presence! featured images of the Sound of Young Scotland era of bands, including Orange Juice, Altered Images and Fire Engines. Revealed! was a similarly styled document of the same era in Liverpool by Francesco Mellina, who photographed the likes of the late Pete Burnsrsquo band, Dead or Alive, and the post-punk scene based around Ericrsquos club.The Scene Inbetween and Untypical Girls are two volumes of DIY images taken of bands and fans in the s and s collated by Sam Knee, and which feature several images by Reekie. In a similar vein, former journalist turned AR man Ronnie Gurrrsquos Hanging Around Books has launched an ongoing series of booklets featuring never before seen seen images of the likes of Simple Minds and the Skids.As the age of the archive runs on, Reekie himself has thousands of photographic negatives in storage. These include shots of Edwyn Collins and Roddy Frame performing at the Assembly Rooms in Edinburgh, and of Sonic Youthrsquos Kim Gordon alongside Lydia Lunch in their short-lived duo, Harry Crews.ldquoI reckon wersquove got enough to do another seven books, Reekie speculates. ldquoI could do one of early s club le in Edinburgh. Thatrsquos more about the people who were there rather than the bands, which might appeal to people of a certain vintage who were around then.It is this sense of empathy that makes Sometimes Severed Heads Must Burn such a crucial document of its era.ldquoItrsquos a step back in time, says Reekie, ldquoand because itrsquos all fly on the wall stuff, you can see therersquos a trust there, which the people in the pictures didnrsquot have with a lot of people at that time.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

This is a new permanent  scheme.Councillor Matthew Reiss, Thurso and Northwest Caithness, a former senior police officer with a particular interest in road safety, said: ldquoIf you have a lower speed limit, safety is improved ndash that is a fact.ldquoIf the local residents are happy with it then Irsquom very happy.

They also improved the character of residential areas and the quality of le for residents, he added.Councillor Andrew Sinclair, Wick and East Caithness, admitted to being a bit sceptical when he first heard about the proposal. ldquoIt sounded like change for the sake of change. Whilst I have slightly warmed to the idea, I still have some concerns, he said.Councillor Sinclair thinks the vast majority of vehicles are already driving at around mph through Wick anyway.He wonders how effectively the new speed limits will be implemented with all the current pressures and priorities of the police.The scheme is being rolled out across the region with restrictions implemented for Alness, Dingwall, Invergordon and Tain. Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Thursday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118855.jpg","title":"Oldest reactor is set to go","story":"WORK is expected to start at Dounreay early in the new year on a multimillion-pound contract to dismantle Scotlands oldest nuclear reactor.The contract ndash understood to be valued at around pound million ndash has been awarded to Cavendish Nuclear following a tendering process and is expected to last about three years.

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As we expected, with any windfarm development, our announcement attracted a range of views — and these have been taken into consideration when developing the plans.#We undertook to keep the local and wider community closely involved as the project progressed and we#re looking forward to heading out to Hoy to discuss revised plans with local folk.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line. It cannot and will not be abandoned or renegotiated,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours.

Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonIt is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.Peoples Democracyemerged as one of the constituent parts of the wider Civil Rights Movementin the north of Ireland during the late s.It was a collective of radical students influenced like the rest of the emergent CRM by global events and motivated by a resolve to bring an end to the injustices of the then unionist state.Inspired by the political example of the Selma to Montgomery march organised by the American CRM, the PD and notably without the approval of the wider CRM, decided to march from Belfast to Derry in a highly symbolic protest against the denial of democratic and civil rights in the north.The march began on st January and eventually arrived in Derry on Saturday th January .  But, not before it was violently confronted by unionist extremists, supported by members of the B-Specials state militia, as it passed through Antrim town and Randalstown in South Antrim, and then most notoriously at Burntollet Bridge, outside Claudy and finally again at Irish Street in Derry, before finally arriving at the citys Guildhall.and Brackareilly, near Maghera.Where the route of the march was blocked by unionists, local people provided transport to the next clear point on the journey.Among the numbers to join and support the marchers as it passed through South Antrim and South Derry were local republicans, including IRA volunteers and members of the then Republican Clubs local Hibernians, social democrats, as well as other progressive minded people, who recognised the importance of the march, and respected those participating. The Long March to Derry as it came to be known made its own historic contribution to the demise of the old unionist regime in the north of Ireland.So to mark this landmark event, fty years on from the actual date of the ambush on the marchers at Burntollet, Sinn Féin in my South Antrim constituency organised an evening of reminiscence and political discussion, compered by the author and Sinn Féins former Director of Publicity, Danny Morrison.A specially produced video by Noel and Noel Óg Maguire was shown, sharing local peoples eye witness accounts and recollections of what happened in Antrim, Randalstown, Toome, and also at Burntollet.Civil rights veterans, and former Sinn Féin MLAs, Mary Nelis and Mitchel Mc Laughlin, and myself then participated in a  discussion.That reviewed the pre-civil rights period, how the CRM came into existence, and how the civil rights era gave way to the political conflict, leading up to the peace process, and the present day political situation.It was an excellent event, with an audience spanning three or four generations from South Antrim and South Derry.Some present were reconnecting with historical events which they helped shape, and which in turn shaped them: others were of an age to draw parallels between their own contemporary experiences of rights denied today with the denial of rights fty years ago.What the Long March to Derry in , and the sequence of other events of that same year, climaxing with the pogroms of August , brought sharply into focus was that partition remained the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society: and, that the denial of civil rights in the north was, and remains inisible from the denial of Irish national independence. Following the RUC assault on the civil rights marchers in Duke Street, Derry, on th October , the Long March to Derry again exposed for a world audience the institutionalised sectrarianism of the northern state, and extent of unionist opposition to the equality and rights agenda.Nothing would ever be the same again.It took a further thirty years before the Good Friday Agreementdrew a line under the use of political violence provided the political architecture of the Irish peace process and, established in legislation equality and human rights for all citizens in many ways the GFA addressed what the CRM did not resolve.It gave expression with an internationally binding treaty to the crux of the CRM agenda, by establishing the bench marks of equality, rights, and respect for all citizens.It became our societys road map away from the legacy of political violence towards the achievement of a rights based society, with parity of esteem, mutual respect and anti-sectarianism, at its core.Both the British and Irish governments have failed to fully implement the GFA.Just as the unionist state in  opposed the CRM, signicant sections of political unionism have pushed back against the GFA since .It is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,  a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.And, that is the fundamental reason why the democratic political institutions in the north remain suspended and why the GFA faces its greatest ever threat.Make no mistake, there is a deep systemic crisis in the north of Ireland.Now that crisis is deepening with the onset of the Brexit catastrophe.Brexit has swept away all of the previously established assumptions about the constitutional, political and economic status quo in Ireland north and south.A solution to the depth of this crisis will only be found through negotiation and decisive political leadership, which

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Not initially aware of his good fortune, the two cash-strapped women learn that their patient won’t be around for long and are then faced with a moral dilemma of should they or shouldn’t they… Long time Marie Jones collaborator Katie Tumelty told Daily Belfast how the play has a “universal voice” in its themes that are as prevalent today as when the play was first performed back in .“This play deals with the working woman, in this case two care workers who are running to and from the people that they care for on a daily basis,” she said. “Their work is invaluable to so many families but in the cases of Frances and Loretta there is more going on behind the scenes. Marie’s play deals with poverty, death and dilemma but at the same time has so much humour running throughout it.“Both characters are hard workers, they have stresses in work, stresses at home and they are just trying to make ends meet and get through their working day. I play the character of Frances who looks at the same sky as everyone  every morning, has hopes, aspirations and it’s like many peoplethe situation arises – what to doa small amount of money, should it be £ or £, comes their way, do they take it “What starts out as a tiny grain of sand soon becomes an avalanche for the two women to deal with. The piece is Marie at her finest,” she added.Katie continued: “Everybody knows a Frances or a Loretta, they are going in and out of hundreds of home every day to help those in their care. I remember so many times being stopped in the Kennedy Centre with people saying that the show should be on prescription, that Marie should be getting her wages through the NHS such is the tonic the show has proven to be.”Fly Me To The Moon and its message have been welcomed around the world on stages in New York, Canada, Sweden and most recently Iceland.“For this run I’m performing with Abigail McGibbon and it’s like a homecoming for her as she performed the part back at the start. It’s great to be bringing the show to the Grand Opera House main auditorium for the week and we will be touring down south once the curtain comes down on the .“There is no doubt that those coming to see it will leave with a message and huge laughs in what is a very current, relevant piece of theatre.”Fly Me To The Moon will be performed at the Grand Opera House from January  to .

We were found wanting and the players know that.#The only thing I will take from that is that it had reinforced in my own mind some of the players who are stepping up and others we will have to review.#Antrim actually hit the first point of the game through Paddy McBride in the opening minute, but they were to be swamped at the other end with the points flowing for Armagh before a stray Colm Fleming kick-out gave Ryan McShane a gt of a goal to move Armagh - to - ahead on  minutes.Their second major arrived a minute later, this time from a Jamie Clarke penalty after another stray pass resulted in Rory Grugan being hauled back in the area.By the time McBride added to the Antrim tally on  minutes, the game was gone as Clarke and man-of-the-match Stefan Campbell caused havoc at the other end with Armagh leading - to - at the half.McGeeney#s charges did appear to take their foot off the gas a little in the second half, but it was hard to blame them as the game became rather pedestrian.Credit to the hosts who kept plugging away with Niall Delargy and McBride leading the way in attack and they did grab a consolation goal through Eoghan McCabe with the last act of the game, but this was a rare blemish for Armagh who were worthy winners.“It’s the old adage of goals win games and once you concede two in three minutes it#s massive,” Harbinson added.“Armagh#s tackling was very good too and I thought maybe in the second half we were blown up for some easier stuff, but that#s the inconsistencies.“Armagh showed the desire of getting men forward and breaking lines, but we were just a bit slow in doing that.“It#s disappointing because the boys are working really hard and we know they are. We made eight changes from last week against Monaghan because we#re using the McKenna Cup to look at players, although some were enforced on us through injury. When you make all those changes, you run the risk against a very good team of being exposed and that#s what#s happened.”ANTRIM: C Fleming P Brannigan, R Johnston, A Sweeney P Finnegan, D Lynch, P Gallagher M Sweeney, E Walsh M McCarry, M Fitzpatrick, C DuffinK Quinn , E McCabe , P McBride .

At our annual dinner last year, he not only donated tickets for an Ireland match with access to the players lounge, he along with Erin turned up at the event and bid on the items. \"At one stage James was outbidding others, but then Erin stepped in and outbid him, so between the two of them we were able to raise so much money.\"He added: \"James continued support has meant so much to the whole family as well as the foundation.\"When Ryan passed away there were so many people paying tributes, but James has been among the few to remain constant in his support since then and that has meant so much.\"James grew up with a similar background to Ryan and he has the same passion about giving something back to the community that was so important to Ryan.\"Having his name associated with our foundation is something we just couldnt put a price on. \"He has helped raise the profile and prestige of the foundation, which has helped us do so much, and we are always thankful for that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"new teachers in northern ireland worst paid in uk and republic claim unions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Fayulu received more than six million votes .This is DR Congo’s first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since independence in .Mr Kabila has ruled since  in the troubled nation rich in the minerals key to smartphones around the world and has amassed vast wealth.He is barred from serving three consecutive terms, but during more than two years of election delays many Congolese feared he would find a way to stay in office.This is the beginning of national reconciliationFacebookTwitter“This is the coronation of a letime,” the deputy secretary-general of Mr Tshisekedi’s party, Rubens Mikindo, said above the cheers at party headquarters.“This is the beginning of national reconciliation.”Scores of people in the capital, Kinshasa, danced after the election results were announced long after midnight, but observers waited to see how other Congolese would respond, especially after Mr Fayulu this week warned that the results were “not negotiable”.Activist groups on Wednesday urged people to “be ready to massively take to the streets”results did not match “the truth of the ballot boxes”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Residents celebrate in Kinshasa Attention turns to DR Congo’s powerful Catholic church, which has said its , election observers at all polling stations found a “clear winner” but was barred by electoral regulations from saying more.The delayed results come after international pressure to announce an outcome that reflected the will of the people.The United States threatened sanctions against officials who rigged the vote.The largely peaceful election was marred by the maling of many voting machines that DR Congo used for the first time.Dozens of polling centres opened hours late as materials went missing. And in a last-minute decision, some one million of the country’s  million voters were barred from participating, with the electoral commission blaming a deadly Ebola virus outbreak.Defiantly, tens of thousands of voters in one of the barred communities held their own ballot on election day. Mr Fayulu won easily.DR Congo’s government cut internet service the day after the vote to prevent speculation on social media. As the electoral commission met this week, anti-riot police moved into place outside.On Wednesday afternoon, hours before results were announced, some Tshisekedi supporters began to celebrate at his Union for Democracy and Social Progress party headquarters, with calendars already printed saying “Felix Tshisekedi president”.Mr Tshisekedi, , took over as head of DR Congo’s most prominent opposition party in early , a year after his father’s death."},{"url":null,"title":"tierney reiterates sdlp call halt roll universal credit","story":"Derry SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney has reiterated the SDLP’s call for a halt in the roll out until there is urgent reform of Universal Credit saying the delay annouced by the British Government in effect will inflict greater hardship and suffering on people. He again made this call as the British Government confirmed the next stage of the universal credit rollout is to be scaled back. The Ballyarnett councillorsaid: “The SDLP has been consistently clear that scaling back Universal Credit is not good enough. Its roll out must be halted until there is urgent and radical reform, not least when it comes to the minimum five week wait for first payment and the two child rule. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“The delay in moving people onto Universal Credit is an admission by the Tory Government that this system is flawed and is causing hurt and hardship, but this delay does not protect people. In effect it means more people are likely to lose out and be worse off as they are left to move on to Universal Credit under managed migration or premature migration where they will automatically lose the premiums they are currently receiving and rely on to make ends meet.“It is also interesting to hear parties like Sinn Féin who, along with the DUP and Alliance, voted to enable the introduction of Universal Credit in the north call for it to be scrapped. Placards and press releases won’t protect people from this cruel and flawed system. People need and deserve to have an Executive and Assembly that takes real and meaningful action to tackle the failings of this cruel system.\""},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/9269930.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Car used to ram -year-old from moped in targeted attack found, police believeAccident\" class\"lazy\" style\"display: block min-height: rem\" data-iesrc\" .jpg htypetypemc\"Government considering move on workers’ rights to win Brexit deal supportAccident\"\"\"Driver quizzed as suspected migrants found in stopped lorry that caused M jamAccident\"\"\"Brexit may have brought prospect of an Irish unity poll forward, report notesAccident\"\"\"Most WI members donate to foodbanks, study suggestsAccident\"\"\"Almost half LGBT Scots have experienced depression in last year – researchAccident\"\"\"Apprenticeship system not responding to employers’ needs, says reportAccident\"\"\"Rolls-Royce car manufacturing will stay in Britain after Brexit, says bossAccident\"\"\"Post-Brexit immigration changes disastrous for Scotland, minister warnsAccident\"\"\"Man charged in Australia over suspicious packages sent to embassiesAccident\"\"\"Meghan’s first royal patronage revealed by mistakeAccident\"\"\"Shinzo Abe visit puts spotlight on Japan’s concerns over BrexitAccident\"\"\"Ireland not trying to trap UK and NI with backstop – CoveneyAccident\"\"\"Billionaire Tom Steyer will not seek presidency but backs moves to impeach TrumpAccident\"\"\"PM entertains backbenchers at Number  ahead of key Brexit voteAccident\"\"\"Five things we learned from the Brexit debateAccident\"\"\"Donald Trump walks out of meeting with Democrats on shutdownAccident\"\"\"Starlings ‘like fireworks’ as they produce aerial displays across IrelandAccident\"\"\"Man held after people flee lorry stopped on the MAccident\"\"\"Moped death boy, , targeted in horric attack, say policeAccident\"\"\"Fth man in court after Hogmanay disturbance seriously injures manAccident\"\"\"Arrest after people leave lorry on MAccident\"\"\"Former Soviet politician and coup plotter Anatoly Lukyanov dies aged Accident\"\"\"Harman calls for Westminster conference to tackle abuse of MPsAccident\"\"\"Colin Farrell finally content after ‘druggie’ yearsAccident\"\"\"Amputee given double hand transplant after five years on waiting listAccident\"\"\"Speedboat killer’s lawyer: I’m not protecting a fugitiveAccident\"\"\"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to orce from we after  years of marriageAccident\"\"\"Sturgeon questioned over Salmond meetings during complaints investigationAccident\"\"\"Priory faces large fine after death of girl, Accident\"\"\"Tributes paid to former lord mayor of Belfast Ian AdamsonAccident\"\"\"New concession on backstop following furious row over Brexit voteAccident\"\"\"Food and drink sector warns against ban on unhealthy food promotionsAccident\"\"\"Hunt: forced marriage victims will not have to take out loans for UK Accident\"\"\"Brexit will not cause delays at Calais, insists port chiefAccident\"\"\"Sinn Fein: EU leaders will not renegotiate the Irish border backstopAccident\"\"\"Strong support for Edinburgh tourist tax, consultation findsAccident\"\"\"Fresh Government assurances on Irish border backstop ‘meaningless’Accident\"\"\"Ministers to bring forward legislation on CCTV in abattoirsAccident\"\"\"New law planned to tackle ‘potential loopholes’ in fox hunting banAccident\"\"\"Extending Article  ‘may well be inevitable now’, Labour sayAccident\"\"\"Animal rights campaigners hit out at deer cullAccident\"\"\"Mouse spotted making dash for freedom during Scottish Parliament meetingAccident\"\"\"Mountaineers demand better protection of Glen Etive amid hydro power plansAccident\"\"\"William flies helicopter to hospital as he marks air ambulance anniversaryAccident\"\"\"Shop explosion which injured  ‘an insurance job which went badly wrong’Accident\"\"\"Tory Party official who falsied expenses ‘carried away’ by bid to beat FarageAccident\"\"\"May suffers another Commons Brexit defeatAccidentGet involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential.

They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

.removeAttr  .html  .html.valDUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has branded the government#s assurances over the Irish border backstop arrangements #meaningless and cosmetic#.In a last-ditch bid to win support for the prime minister’s withdrawal agreement ahead of a crucial vote next Tuesday, the government released details of new measures designed to assuage the fears of her DUP allies.In a paper published on Wednesday, the government saida EU UK trade deal fails to materialise by the end of the implementation period in , there would be a legally binding commitment to “consult” with Stormont before deciding to either enter the backstop or ask for an extension of the implementation period.The view of the Assembly, said the government, would then be presented to Parliament before MPs took a final decision on the issue.If the backstop does come into effect, the government said the NI Assembly and Executive would then be given a strong oversight role in its operation.If the EU proposed changing any laws that impacted on the operating of the backstop, the UK would have to consent to such a measure applying to Northern Ireland and the government has now committed to seek the agreement of the Assembly before signing off on any such change.But DUP Westminster leader Mr Dodds said the withdrawal agreement would override any domestic law changes made by the government.He added: “The Assembly would not be able to override UK international legal obligations as the backstop provisions would be in the treaty.“Furthermore, it is clear that under these proposals providing a law for a mandatory process of consultation with the Assembly on whether to bring the backstop into effect would ultimately have no bearing on the decisions to be taken by Parliament.“Were we to find the backstop being brought into effect then, in such circumstances there would be no exit mechanism from the backstop and consequently these series of measures outlined by the government would not be sufficient to deal with the major and signicant flaws of an internationally binding backstop arrangement,” Mr Dodds added.UUP leader Robin Swann labelled the government’s commitments as “frankly insulting”, adding: “No amount of political assurances or explanatory notes will change the fact that there are fundamental problems with the backstop and the democratic deficit it will create.” and

May#s proposed Brexit deal shows a widespread belief thatthe Northern Irish backstop is ever implemented it would increase the chances of a united Ireland.The poll, which was commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign arguing for a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, was conducted in mid-December and shown to the News Letter yesterday.The poll was conducted south of the border in DecemberThe research shows a particularly strong belief among young people that the backstop would fuel support for removing the border, with% of under s stating that the backstop would make Irish unity more likely.The People’s Vote campaign said that they had not asked any other questions as part of the poll, so it is not possible to compare how southern voters view the backstop in comparison to alternatives such as leaving the EU without a deal or not leaving the EU at all.The backstop – to be triggeredno other solution can be agreed to prevent a hard border – would involve Northern Ireland remaining aligned with some EU rules eventhe rest of the UK erges.Respondents were asked: “Do you think the Backstop section of the Brexit deal will make the eventual prospect of a United Ireland”, followed by a list of options from “a lot more likely” to “a lot less likely”.Just % thought it made Irish unity less likely, while % said that it would be more likely and % said that it would make no dference.However, there was a huge disparity across the generations. Among the middle-aged, just % thought the backstop makes unity more likely – but among under s, that figure more that doubled.The belief that the backstop would make unity more likely was also higher in border areas and other traditionally more republican areas such as Cork and Kerry.The polling, conducted in the run-up to Christmas, saw , adults being interviewed by pollsters Ireland Thinks. Eighty per cent of the interviews were by phone, with the rest conducted online. When asked who funded the research, the People’s Vote campaign said that most of its money came from public donations but that it has some large unnamed donors.Former secretary of state Lord Hain appealed to the DUP to not only reject Theresa May’s proposed deal, but also reject a no-deal Brexit and instead support a second referendum. The Labour peer, who backs a second referendum, said: “The DUP’s decision to back Brexit may yet come to embarrass them because there is no prospect of any sort of deal with the European Union that does not involve a backstop – and Irish voters see this as a step towards a united Ireland.Nationalist and republican parties now ‘anti-Catholic’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The DUP must also know that a ‘no deal’ would be a catastrophe for Northern Ireland, especially for farming communities in the border regions. The one thing the DUP is known for is having tactical ‘nous’ and the logic for them – as it must be for MPs of all parties in the House of Commons – is to back the idea of the public being given the final say in a new vote where people will be given an option of staying in the EU with the deal we’ve already got.”But the DUP’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said that the  vote had been UK-wide and “the result must be respected and implemented”.He said: “The party has been consistent on the backstop. It is not needed. No one is building a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Indeed, with every day that passes, it is becoming clearer that not even the Republic of Ireland ever believed the hard border spin. “The backstop will place a border between Northern Ireland and GB. That is unacceptable both constitutionally and economically. If the EU really cared about Northern Ireland, they would be no more willing to build an east-west border than they are to build a north-south border.”Mr Dodds said that his party wants to see “an orderly exit from the EU”. However, he added: “That can be achieved but EU intransigence must be replaced by a recognition that the backstop is not acceptable.”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

The alarm was raised by her friends, and they, together with members of the public and a Penarth RNLI volunteer, helped to keep her safe before the leboat was launched.A throw line was used to reach the casualty, and lejackets were obtained from the leboat station.The ywoman was struggling to hold on, and with high spring tides the RNLI crew member entered the water to fit her lejacket and support her, knowing that the leboat crew had been paged and were on their way.The D-class leboat was launched quickly, and brought the casualty and the Penarth crew member safely back to the station.A medical check was carried out on both, and although cold and wet they were deemed fit and well.Jason Dunlop, Penarth RNLI Leboat Operations Manager paid tribute to all those involved: \"With such a high tide, in darkness and in cold water, the casualty could have easily drted out of sight. By hanging on as she did and with the support of everyone involved the rescue was affected quickly and safely.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mr Fayulu received more than six million votes .This is DR Congorsquos first peaceful, democratic transfer of power since independence in .Mr Kabila has ruled since  in the troubled nation rich in the minerals key to smartphones around the world and has amassed vast wealth.He is barred from serving three consecutive terms, but during more than two years of election delays many Congolese feared he would find a way to stay in office.ldquoThis is the coronation of a letime, the deputy secretary-general of Mr Tshisekedirsquos party, Rubens Mikindo, said above the cheers at party headquarters.ldquoThis is the beginning of national reconciliation.Scores of people in the capital, Kinshasa, danced after the election results were announced long after midnight, but observers waited to see how other Congolese would respond, especially after Mr Fayulu this week warned that the results were ldquonot negotiable.Activist groups on Wednesday urged people to ldquobe ready to massively take to the streetsresults did not match ldquothe truth of the ballot boxes.Residents celebrate in Kinshasa Attention turns to DR Congorsquos powerful Catholic church, which has said its , election observers at all polling stations found a ldquoclear winner but was barred by electoral regulations from saying more.The delayed results come after international pressure to announce an outcome that reflected the will of the people.The United States threatened sanctions against officials who rigged the vote.The largely peaceful election was marred by the maling of many voting machines that DR Congo used for the first time.Dozens of polling centres opened hours late as materials went missing.

This is good for them and this is good for both colleges.“But what about the other % who do not, in particular what about those who are the most educationally vulnerable in the Lurgan area, why should their future be decided by those who go to Portadown schools or who are likely to be selected for one of the colleges.“The Education Authorityhave been working toward a solution and as part of that solution a number of options have been identied.“One of those options is for the children in Lurgan to stay in Lurgan and for the Lurgan Junior High Schools to become an – school with academic selection still taking place allowing children to go to the Lurgan College at . “However, this option is being discounted because of the words of the last Education Minister in June  where he made it clear that the Dickson Plan would not be removed ‘either directly or undermined through stealth’.“Yet it is clear that the Dickson plan is not being undermined and that selection will still take place at  with the option to go to Lurgan College at that time. Four vehicle smash on MMan charged over burglaries Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“Therefore the former Minister’s words are being used not as they were intended but in an attempt to dissuade support for change. The adding of this statement will do nothing but reignite the bitter dispute around the Dickson Plan when there is no need to do so. It will feed into the fear of those parents and communities throughout the area who feel there is an attack on the Dickson Plan.“In itself it will create a negative response and fear that schools in Portadown will somehow be affected by a plan for Lurgan that puts Lurgan pupils and the Lurgan community at its heart.“I have been absolutely clear onwhere I stand on this issue. The children in Lurgan cannot stay at the Lurgan Campus site on Kitchen Hill, it is simply not fit for purpose, while bussing them to Portadown to a consolidated CSHS would be detrimental to the children and the wider Lurgan community.“Therefore creating an educational hub in Lurgan on the site of the Lurgan Junior High School through the provisions of - education would enhance education in the area while at the same time retaining the guidelines of the Dickson Plan with no detrimental effect on post primary schools and education in the wider Lurgan, Portadown and Tandragee area.“I am now calling on all elected representatives from all political parties in the area, civic leaders and educationalists to get behind a proposal for Lurgan Junior High School to become an - school with academic selection remaining at . I’m asking for parents from Portadown, Lurgan and Tandragee whose child is likely to go to one of the colleges or to the Portadown Campus of CSHS to support a Lurgan solution and I am asking the Board of Governors, teachers and Principals of Tandragee Junior High School, Clounagh Junior High School and Killicomaine Junior High School to support this bespoke solution for Lurgan and finally allow stability for those children and the community of Lurgan who have been badly forgotten over the last  years to finally have a sustainable post primary educational pathway.”An Education Authorityspokesperson said: “Craigavon Senior High School currently provides vitally important post-primary education services to the Craigavon area and currently operates across two campuses. “EA is undertaking consultation on how future provision at Craigavon Senior High School will be shaped. The purpose of this consultation is to seek the views of those most directly involved at a local level and will begin on Monday,  January, . “The consultation events will provide an opportunity to explore all of the facts and discuss the issues which will help shape future provision at Craigavon Senior High School for many years to come. “A letter inviting parents, staff and governors to participate in consultation events was issued on Monday,  January, . Consultation will also be undertaken with pupils during January .” try catch            ..

The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34344455.jpg","title":"delta air lines buying  new airbus jets","story":"Posted on Monday January  by Ulster Business US carrier Delta Air Lines is buying an additional  part-Belfast made passenger planes, it has emerged.
