Each morsel has been crafted to be consumed in just two delicate bites.The Queen is officially hosting the event and Buckingham Palace staff revealed that the menu would comprise ‘classic dishes’ made from seasonal British produce, much from the monarch’s own estates.Harry and his bride-to-be have tasted and selected their wedding reception menu.The couple apparently visited Windsor Castle to sample menu suggestions in the Great Kitchen, which dates from the reign of the 14th century monarch Edward III.It is believed to be the oldest working kitchen in the country, having served more than 30 monarchs.Royal chef Mark Flanagan is leading the 30-strong catering team and said: ‘The day of the wedding has fallen very kindly for us.‘All the British vegetables are just coming into season... and that’s been a point of focus for us.\u0027We know the couple wanted us to make sure we used all of the local seasonal produce as much as possible throughout their menu, and this recent good weather is really helping us to achieve that.’He added the couple have ‘been involved in every detail’.Meghan is a keen ‘foodie’ who used to run her own lifestyle website, which featured her favourite recipes and restaurants. She also shares a love of organic produce with her future father-in-law, Prince Charles.Mr Flanagan would not discuss the dishes in detail but produce such as asparagus, peas and tomatoes are in season, providing a wealth of options for the chef, who has worked with some of the world’s best, including Michel and Albert Roux.He added: ‘There’s no experimentation on Saturday whatsoever, tried and tested and predominantly classics.’ Over the next few days staff will start washing and peeling vegetables, so they can save time for presentation, Mr Flanagan said.A separate dinner for 200 is being held at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales later in the evening.Cheeky pooches team together to eat some treatsTeenager found with knife stuck in her cheek after being muggedFather recounts tearful memories of his two slain childrenNick Clegg, David Miliband and Nicky Morgan on Brexit negotiationsPetra the parrot has a few words with virtual assistant AlexaFootage of people running away from knifeman in ParisNot alone: Police escort son of fallen officer back to schoolThousands of flies swarming around a camel in Australian desertFinal moments of Malaysia Airline MH370 to be revealedTake a look at life as a Club 18-30 summer rep"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/13/10/4C2A21B100000578-0-image-m-16_1526202287952.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan stay separate Windsor hotels night wedding","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on May 19 in Windsor but will stay apart on the night before  Prince Harry will stay at the Dorchester Collection\u0027s Coworth Park (pictured) in Sunningdale, Berkshire, on Friday, which is owned by the Sultan of Brunei  Harry and his brother will enjoy sumptuously furnished bedrooms like this on the night before walking down the aisle  Meghan will stay at Cliveden House Hotel (pictured), on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate, with her mother Doria.

I was so shocked at what was happening. I just said \u0027it\u0027s dead, this baby is going to die\u0027. I was so shocked.\u0027\u0027          Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labourThe hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 as the unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated.It can be 10cm fully dilated.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: \u0027I remember 3cm dilation being said and I saw Dr Laxman go to examine her but I don\u0027t know what she was doing. \u0027I believe she was examining the patient to confirm the findings but she didn\u0027t tell me why she was examining the patient. \u0027She could not comment on what she was doing but another doctor told me they were not considering a Caesarean section. All I heard Dr Laxman say to the patient was \u0027I\u0027m going to examine you\u0027.\u0027If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery. I never got the information that she was going to do that. I\u0027m not sure what she was doing.Premature baby was DECAPITATED inside his mother\u0027s womb...Share this article\u0027We were set up for a c-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated. I was under the impression we were going to do a c-section and this caused us a delay - I didn\u0027t know what she was planning.\u0027I said \u0027are you not going for a section\u0027 and all she said was \u0027I know that\u0027. I don\u0027t know what the plan was in her mind. After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn\u0027t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.\u0027The patient was pushing the baby and the baby was being delivered by traction. It was repeated pulls and traction and it lasted for approximately 15-20 minutes.\u0027I wanted to look for any foetal abnormality but Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down. This was not what I was expecting.           Dr Vaishnavy Laxman outside her MPTS tribunal hearing at the GMC in Manchester\u0027If she was only at 3cm it would have been right for her to have a c-section. I just said \u0027this baby is dead now\u0027 I was so shocked. I didn\u0027t express this to Dr Laxman.\u0027I had no confirmation of this as I wasn\u0027t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby\u0027s heartbeat had dropped. I saw the baby\u0027s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.\u0027Dr Laxman said to the patient \u0027give me a good push\u0027 and there was repeated pulling on the legs and body. Sometimes the shoulders are tricky to deliver as the arms can get stuck and it can be heard to get out.\u0027The information of her consultation was that she was not properly dilated but it was hard to know how hard this was to get the baby out. There was two attempts made by Dr Laxman to cut the cervix but I didn\u0027t know what she was doing.\u0027Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a \u0027fragile\u0027 baby like the infant who died would suffer \u0027a lot more damage if pulled or twisted\u0027.The hearing continues.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Who Tiger Woodss girlfriend Erica Herman revealed","story":"Jon Stewart and Dave Chappelle announce joint stand-up tourWho is Kelvin Hayden?

Which presumably he would regard as a happy outcome. We mustn’t upset Brussels, after all.Many listeners would have concluded that a man who gives up his seat in Parliament and takes a huge salary abroad has no right to pontificate on our political future. Will voters really welcome him back to the country he abandoned?They will point to the irony in Miliband, 52, taking time off from his £400,000-a-year job running the International Rescue charity in New York to portray himself as the lost voice of the British people.His former constituency, South Shields, is in the South Tyneside area, which voted 68 per cent Leave in the referendum — not that listening to the people comes naturally to a man more used to hobnobbing with liberal darlings such as George Clooney and Hillary Clinton.  Tony Blair is behind the BRexit bashing comeback of former British foreign secretary David Miliband, Andrew Pierce writesHow piquant that Miliband Major has resurfaced just as his former role as foreign secretary is under the microscope. It was only last Thursday that Theresa May apologised over the Blair government’s involvement in the torture of a Libyan dissident by the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli.Miliband, who became foreign secretary three years later in 2007, has been accused of lying over what he knew about extraordinary rendition (the euphemism for the kidnap and torture of terror suspects overseen by the CIA) in an attempt to keep the New Labour government off the hook. Funny how he didn’t mention that at yesterday’s carefully stage-managed launch.Undoubtedly, his appearance with Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan will fuel speculation that he is planning to revive his political career.Diane Abbott is caught out posting a FAKE image of an...Beam them up! Star Trek captain joins MPs on Planet Bremoan...Share this articleOne reason why he left Britain was the falling-out with his brother. Relations became so poor that he failed to invite Ed to his 50th birthday party in London in 2015.But, intriguingly, David has now buried the hatchet with Ed. A friend of the family told me this week: ‘They will never be as close as they were, but they are talking again. They have young children and want the children to get together.’AttentionWhile Miliband has made a success of his new life in the U.S., he was bitterly disappointed that his friend Hillary Clinton failed to become the Democratic president. There was even talk of a big job under Clinton in the American government, but the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House has forced Miliband to turn his attention to British politics once more.A return to these shores would offer tempting career prospects for Miliband’s wife, Louise Shackelton, a concert violinist. Last autumn, the celebrated conductor Sir Simon Rattle returned to Britain after more than a decade at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic. He is now director of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). Despite living in New York, Ms Shackelton has played with the LSO in London since Rattle’s return, and there would be a permanent post if she wanted it. A complicating factor if the Milibands returned to Britain is that their young sons are happily settled in schools in New York.However, there is a ‘break clause’ this year in Miliband’s contract with International Rescue. That means the reaction to yesterday’s performance — among the public and from MPs — may have a major bearing on whether he has a future in British politics.While he is seen by Blairite MPs as his party’s lost leader, Miliband knows the chances of making a successful second bid for the leadership are challenging, to say the least.          Former foreign secretary David Miliband, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg and Conservative ex-cabinet minister Nicky Morgan are launching anti-Brexit driveSaviourThe majority of Labour’s 500,000 members, who have the final say over the leadership, are followers of Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-Left politics, which means it might even be difficult for David Miliband to be selected for a safe Labour seat. The Corbynista roots already run deep, and they loathe Blairites almost as much as they hate Tories.But what if Miliband is not interested in leading Labour: what if he has ambitions to set up a new centrist party instead? It might appeal to his Remoaner chum Clegg, who is increasingly out of step with the Lib Dems since the collapse of the coalition, and to Tory malcontents such as Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, who were both sacked by Mrs May.The creation of a new party is, in fact, the brainchild of a businessman named Simon Franks, who is reportedly putting up £50 million to make it a reality, having made his fortune renting out DVDs. He has called it ‘Project One Movement for the UK’.Does Miliband see himself as the saviour of British politics, riding in on his white charger to plant his flag in the centre ground? Watch this space.Whether British voters will welcome the return of the ‘king across the water’ is rather less certain.     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/01/4C3EBE0B00000578-5729169-image-m-41_1526343822117.jpg","title":"Gap apologizes T shirts printed map China map omits Taiwan","story":"    American clothing retailer Gap apologized for printing incomplete Chinese map on T-shirts for sales outside China          Chinese territories, including South Tibet, the island of Taiwan and the South China Sea were omitted from the map on the T-shirt\u0027We\u0027ve learned a Gap brand T-shirt sold in some overseas markets mistakenly failed to reflect the correct map of China.

The horse rescuer has revealed there has been a huge number of horses being mistreated There’s Daisy, found as a stray in the streets of Chessington Thelma and Louise, left loose in the back roads of Dunsfold Teddy, a young stallion dumped on private property, and Ziggy, another young stallion, abandoned with a filly to wander the lanes.Yesterday’s Mail carried the shocking picture of a pony dumped in the small garden of a home in Stoke-on-Trent.The owner had placed an online advert saying the pony would be put down if nobody could take it, and a 13-year-old girl replied with her grandmother’s address. A man then arrived, dumped the pony and disappeared. In the past few years, horses have been abandoned in their thousands — and it’s getting worse.The RSPCA said last month the number of horses it had rescued has hit a four-year high, with 980 horses being taken into care last year and an average of 80 phone calls a day coming in about horses. Many are in terrible health.Some come from breeders with too many foals who don’t care what happens to them, so long as it costs their business nothing.          Landowners are simply unable to keep their horses due to financial woes and others \u0027simply don\u0027t care\u0027 Jenny Seagrove saysSince the horse meat food scandal in 2013, when sickened shoppers learned that horseflesh was being used in many supermarket ‘beef’ products, the secretive market for human consumption has been shut off to these unscrupulous breeders.But with economic troubles, and the cost of land rising, many private owners are just unable to keep their horses.Some come to us in desperation. They have lost their jobs, fallen ill or been through a orce, and simply can’t afford to stable their beloved animal. Others are getting old and can no longer cope. In some cases, one horse has died and left a second miserable and lonely — a busy sanctuary is a happier place to spend twilight years than an empty field.I have deep sympathy with these owners. If they come to us, they are doing the best they can for their horses.But many others simply don’t care. They condemn their animals to live and die in conditions that beggar belief. Take Millie and Horus — a young mare, and a handsome stallion in his early 20s.They were left in a field of about 100 horses with no food or water. When rescuers found them, the field was scattered with dead and dying animals — Millie and Horus were among the survivors.Woman whose two thoroughbreds were so malnourished they had...A night-mare! Woody looks like the whitest horse in the...Share this articleTwo of our gentlest creatures are mother and daughter, Gwen and Phyllis. Gwen had been savagely beaten and tethered to a goalpost to give birth, and was cut loose, terrified and traumatised.It never fails to baffle me that people treat horses so brutally.One of our herd leaders was called Ernie, a gentle giant 18 hands high, a favourite with mares and visitors. Everyone loved Ernie. But it wasn’t always the case. When he came to us, he would bite the hands and faces of anyone who got too close. He’d been beaten so badly he defended himself against all humans. Gradually, we taught him he didn’t have to be afraid.This is the most rewarding work in the world. Mind you, I never set out to run a sanctuary. I’m an actress and I love my work.But, in 2011, someone I knew phoned me with a desperate problem: she was running a private animal rescue centre and had somehow acquired 40 horses and many other animals and birds.It was hardly surprising that she’d run out of money and I just couldn’t turn my back. I realised there was something I could do: I could start a charity that would take responsibility for the animals and their welfare. Little did I know what a huge task that would be.So with friends and the public being amazingly supportive, Mane Chance was born.It wasn’t all plain sailing. At 7am on the first Sunday after our horses moved into their new home, I had an anguished call from a neighbour. Quad bikers had charged through our field, knocked down the electric fences and spooked the horses . . . who were galloping round the 18th green of the local golf club, causing mayhem.          Jenny Seagrove: \u0027I wish I could say it was rare at Mane Chance Sanctuary to take animals that have been so horribly mistreated, but sadly it is all too common\u0027After six months, the ‘non-equine’ residents and some horses were rehomed, as we worked out a manageable number we could care for. Since 2011, that number has risen to 33 — any more and our staff, and tireless volunteers, risk being stretched too thin. Even within those limits, annual running costs are around £300,000. We’re supported by selfless donors, sponsors, grant givers and businesses, but because of the work we do with young people we need staff experienced at working with people as well as horses. And we need good facilities. It all costs money.Our work with young people began with two Shetland ponies called Grimbo and Mr Smith, who loved company.We took them to a local hospice, and I was amazed to see the powerful effect on children who sat or stood with them, stroking them, giving and receiving unconditional love. It was so moving to watch . . . and it gave me an idea.Most of our horses will never be ridden. Some are too old, others have arthritis. But they can help people, just by being horses. Not all our rescue animals are suitable for this work, but many love it.They seem to understand, when a child with a terminal illness, perhaps, or an older person with dementia, is quietly sharing their company, that they are doing important work.We don’t make any horse work if it doesn’t clearly want to. Most are only too happy to be fussed over, though. In fact, they are so content we’ve decided many will never be rehomed — they’ve endured desperate hardship, and now they’ve found a place they love. We owe them the chance to stay.But with Mane Chance at full capacity, and more calls each week, we need to do more. Tighter legislation is part of it: breeders must not continue to dump young stallions just because they have little use for them (unlike mares, which can bear foals).New laws on microchipping, which will lead to a national ownership register called the Central Equine Database, should help. So would better education for the public: people need to understand how costly it is to keep a horse.Humane euthanasia, when a sick animal needs to be put down, costs about £500, for example. It’s never an acceptable option to dump the poor creature in a field instead.Mane Chance is trying to show that horses don’t need to be thrown away. We dream of little rescued herds all over the country, helping people. We save them, but in many ways they save us, too.n The fee for this article has been donated to Mane Chance Sanctuary (manechance sanctuary.org). "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/05/4C3201D100000578-0-image-m-68_1526360052613.jpg","title":"Modigliani sells 157 2 mn New York Sothebys","story":"Nu Couche(sur le cote gauche) by Amedeo Modigliani sold for $157.2 million in New York, becoming the fourth most expensive work of art sold at auctionModigliani follows Leonardo da Vinci and Pablo Picasso as the third highest-selling artist at auction.

I was so shocked.\u0027\u0027          Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labourThe hearing was told the tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 as the unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 2-3cm dilated.It can be 10cm fully dilated.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: \u0027I remember 3cm dilation being said and I saw Dr Laxman go to examine her but I don\u0027t know what she was doing. \u0027I believe she was examining the patient to confirm the findings but she didn\u0027t tell me why she was examining the patient. \u0027She could not comment on what she was doing but another doctor told me they were not considering a Caesarean section. All I heard Dr Laxman say to the patient was \u0027I\u0027m going to examine you\u0027.\u0027If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery. I never got the information that she was going to do that. I\u0027m not sure what she was doing.Premature baby was DECAPITATED inside his mother\u0027s womb...Share this article\u0027We were set up for a c-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated. I was under the impression we were going to do a c-section and this caused us a delay - I didn\u0027t know what she was planning.\u0027I said \u0027are you not going for a section\u0027 and all she said was \u0027I know that\u0027. I don\u0027t know what the plan was in her mind. After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn\u0027t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.\u0027The patient was pushing the baby and the baby was being delivered by traction. It was repeated pulls and traction and it lasted for approximately 15-20 minutes.\u0027I wanted to look for any foetal abnormality but Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down. This was not what I was expecting.           Dr Vaishnavy Laxman outside her MPTS tribunal hearing at the GMC in Manchester\u0027If she was only at 3cm it would have been right for her to have a c-section. I just said \u0027this baby is dead now\u0027 I was so shocked. I didn\u0027t express this to Dr Laxman.\u0027I had no confirmation of this as I wasn\u0027t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby\u0027s heartbeat had dropped. I saw the baby\u0027s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.\u0027Dr Laxman said to the patient \u0027give me a good push\u0027 and there was repeated pulling on the legs and body. Sometimes the shoulders are tricky to deliver as the arms can get stuck and it can be heard to get out.\u0027The information of her consultation was that she was not properly dilated but it was hard to know how hard this was to get the baby out. There was two attempts made by Dr Laxman to cut the cervix but I didn\u0027t know what she was doing.\u0027Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a \u0027fragile\u0027 baby like the infant who died would suffer \u0027a lot more damage if pulled or twisted\u0027.The hearing continues.     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/14/21/4C3C9B5800000578-5728377-image-a-43_1526329253017.jpg","title":"Marriage proposal upstaged 3 year olds call nature","story":"A hilarious video shows the moment Kevin Przytula, 33, drops down on one knee to propose to  longtime girlfriend Allyssa Anter, 27, at the same time that Anter\u0027s three-year-old son Owen drops his pants to answer nature\u0027s call on Saturday in Bay City, Michigan          Anter gleefully saying \u0027yes\u0027 to the proposal as the two embrace, blissfully unaware that right behind them Owen was emptying his bladder on the sidewalkPartners in crime!

Which presumably he would regard as a happy outcome. We mustn’t upset Brussels, after all.Many listeners would have concluded that a man who gives up his seat in Parliament and takes a huge salary abroad has no right to pontificate on our political future. Will voters really welcome him back to the country he abandoned?They will point to the irony in Miliband, 52, taking time off from his £400,000-a-year job running the International Rescue charity in New York to portray himself as the lost voice of the British people.His former constituency, South Shields, is in the South Tyneside area, which voted 68 per cent Leave in the referendum — not that listening to the people comes naturally to a man more used to hobnobbing with liberal darlings such as George Clooney and Hillary Clinton.  Tony Blair is behind the BRexit bashing comeback of former British foreign secretary David Miliband, Andrew Pierce writesHow piquant that Miliband Major has resurfaced just as his former role as foreign secretary is under the microscope. It was only last Thursday that Theresa May apologised over the Blair government’s involvement in the torture of a Libyan dissident by the Gaddafi regime in Tripoli.Miliband, who became foreign secretary three years later in 2007, has been accused of lying over what he knew about extraordinary rendition (the euphemism for the kidnap and torture of terror suspects overseen by the CIA) in an attempt to keep the New Labour government off the hook. Funny how he didn’t mention that at yesterday’s carefully stage-managed launch.Undoubtedly, his appearance with Nick Clegg and Nicky Morgan will fuel speculation that he is planning to revive his political career.Diane Abbott is caught out posting a FAKE image of an...Beam them up! Star Trek captain joins MPs on Planet Bremoan...Share this articleOne reason why he left Britain was the falling-out with his brother. Relations became so poor that he failed to invite Ed to his 50th birthday party in London in 2015.But, intriguingly, David has now buried the hatchet with Ed. A friend of the family told me this week: ‘They will never be as close as they were, but they are talking again. They have young children and want the children to get together.’AttentionWhile Miliband has made a success of his new life in the U.S., he was bitterly disappointed that his friend Hillary Clinton failed to become the Democratic president. There was even talk of a big job under Clinton in the American government, but the arrival of Donald Trump in the White House has forced Miliband to turn his attention to British politics once more.A return to these shores would offer tempting career prospects for Miliband’s wife, Louise Shackelton, a concert violinist. Last autumn, the celebrated conductor Sir Simon Rattle returned to Britain after more than a decade at the helm of the Berlin Philharmonic. He is now director of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). Despite living in New York, Ms Shackelton has played with the LSO in London since Rattle’s return, and there would be a permanent post if she wanted it. A complicating factor if the Milibands returned to Britain is that their young sons are happily settled in schools in New York.However, there is a ‘break clause’ this year in Miliband’s contract with International Rescue. That means the reaction to yesterday’s performance — among the public and from MPs — may have a major bearing on whether he has a future in British politics.While he is seen by Blairite MPs as his party’s lost leader, Miliband knows the chances of making a successful second bid for the leadership are challenging, to say the least.          Former foreign secretary David Miliband, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg and Conservative ex-cabinet minister Nicky Morgan are launching anti-Brexit driveSaviourThe majority of Labour’s 500,000 members, who have the final say over the leadership, are followers of Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-Left politics, which means it might even be difficult for David Miliband to be selected for a safe Labour seat. The Corbynista roots already run deep, and they loathe Blairites almost as much as they hate Tories.But what if Miliband is not interested in leading Labour: what if he has ambitions to set up a new centrist party instead? It might appeal to his Remoaner chum Clegg, who is increasingly out of step with the Lib Dems since the collapse of the coalition, and to Tory malcontents such as Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry, who were both sacked by Mrs May.The creation of a new party is, in fact, the brainchild of a businessman named Simon Franks, who is reportedly putting up £50 million to make it a reality, having made his fortune renting out DVDs. He has called it ‘Project One Movement for the UK’.Does Miliband see himself as the saviour of British politics, riding in on his white charger to plant his flag in the centre ground? Watch this space.Whether British voters will welcome the return of the ‘king across the water’ is rather less certain.     "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/01/4C3EBE0B00000578-5729169-image-m-41_1526343822117.jpg","title":"Gap apologizes T shirts printed map China map omits Taiwan","story":"    American clothing retailer Gap apologized for printing incomplete Chinese map on T-shirts for sales outside China          Chinese territories, including South Tibet, the island of Taiwan and the South China Sea were omitted from the map on the T-shirt\u0027We\u0027ve learned a Gap brand T-shirt sold in some overseas markets mistakenly failed to reflect the correct map of China.

Grayling announced in November the franchise would be replaced in 2020, three years earlier than expected, allowing the companies to escape large payments. Two months later, he raised the prospect with MPs of the Department for Transport (DfT) running the line. However, he also held out the possibility that the operators could continue on fresh terms.But, according to the FT, he is now planning to scrap the franchise, the third time in less than a decade that the government has been forced to intervene.He is thought to be more likely to choose the temporary “not-for-profit” option in the short term, given his aversion to Labour’s re-nationalisation policy. Ministers have denied that the companies are being bailed out, saying they will lose a £165m performance bond and face other penalties. Beyond 2020, the government is expected to introduce a new public-private partnership model on the line. Virgin Trains East Coast said it had “met or exceeded” all of its contractual commitments on the East Coast line. The DfT declined to comment.Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said: “This is the third time in 10 years that a private company has mucked up the east coast main line. In contrast, when it was run in the public sector, it returned £1bn to the Treasury.“That shows what we have been saying all along - that Britain’s railways should be run, successfully, as a public service, not for private profit.

TSB was spun out of Lloyds in 2013 but had continued to pay for the use of its IT systems.Almost a week into the crisis, TSB drafted in a team from IBM to help solve it, after the chief executive, Paul Pester, admitted the bank was still not on top of the problems with the bank’s internet banking and mobile app.John Mann, a Labour MP on the cross-party Treasury select committee, said TSB’s failure to accept help was a sign that it had failed to acknowledge the scale of the problems and had been “hoping to get away with it”. “They were playing fast and loose with the customers and also with their reputation, which has been so damaged by it now,” he told the FT.Four weeks on from the IT transfer, some customers were still reporting problems accessing their accounts and transferring money.It is as yet unclear how much the botched IT transfer will cost TSB. The bank has repeatedly insisted that no customer would be left out of pocket as a result of the chaos. During a bruising evidence session before the Treasury select committee, Pester was accused by Nicky Morgan, the committee chair, of being “extraordinarily complacent” after he said the bank’s move to a new IT system had mostly run smoothly.Pester has volunteered to give up a £2m bonus linked to the IT transfer, but he could still receive up to £1.3m in other bonuses for 2018, on top of a further £1.3m in basic pay, benefits and pension contributions.Posts on TSB’s Twitter feed on Tuesday suggested the bank was still struggling to cope with the high volume of customer complaints.Lloyds declined to comment.

Is this the future of urban employment?Nicole Tan, a 29-year-old content marketer from Singapore, has visited enough places in the last year to make an Instagram follower weep: Jamaica, Miami, Portland, San Francisco, LA, Budapest, Slovenia, Berlin, Luxembourg, Iceland, Romania, Poland, Paris, Amsterdam and Thailand.In almost all of those places, her working life has continued as usual. “Last year I was moving every other week, or almost every couple of days,” she says. “Time to go, time to go. I had to be at places.” Tan is one of a growing number of “location-independent workers”, or digital nomads. Like many of them, she often has to fly under the radar because governments don’t recognise the way she works.She and thousands of other nomads can travel on a tourist visa or work for a local company, but – though governments often turn a blind eye – it’s technically illegal for them to work remotely.But – in one city at least – that won’t be the case for long. I meet Tan at Lift99, a co-working space in Tallinn. It’s part of Telliskivi Creative City, a hive of colour and enterprise near the main railway station. Once home to the imposing Kalinin electronics factory, the complex now hosts 250 companies, eight restaurants and an arcade of independent shops. There are ping-pong tables. There’s a flea market. There’s a mural showing a skeleton photobombing a hipster’s selfie (a parody of Bernt Notke’s Danse Macabre, a major tourist draw in the nearby Niguliste church).Estonia has just announced the first official visa for digital nomads. The permit will entitle nomads to 365 days of working in Estonia, including 90 days’ travel in the Schengen area. Since EU citizens can already move and work freely, it is aimed at people from further afield: the US, Asia and Latin America (and potentially post-Brexit Britain). It will be launched in January 2019.“I think it’s great,” says Tan. “It’s about time we had something like this.”Famously, Estonia is the state where everything happens online. Internet access is enshrined as a basic human right. Seven-year-olds are taught to code. Citizens can vote, secure mortgages and open bank accounts via the second-fastest public wifi in the world. You can open a business in 10 minutes without leaving your cafe table.It’s also a nation entranced by the power of startups, where there’s a revolving door between the tech scene and government. As a result, the vaunting utopianism of its digital gurus often finds its way into government policy.In case you hadn’t heard – and you will if you visit – Tallinn is the birthplace of Skype, whose phenomenal success in the early 2000s was built around a core of work by Estonian developers. It showed the youth of this wintry former Soviet state that great things were possible like the legendary Velvet Underground gig, everyone who was there went on to start something else.“It almost feels like startups have taken over the city,” according to Norris Koppel, the CEO of Monese, a banking app. The wall at Lift99 features an #EstonianMafia Wall of Fame, which lists firms that have hit $5m in investment: Pipedrive, TransferWise, Funderbeam, Taxify.It’s even a startup that is spearheading the digital nomad visa: Jobbatical, which encourages businesses to cast their recruitment nets wider than usual. In the company’s office, which occupies a converted apartment block in Tallinn’s formerly industrial Kalamaja district, amid beanbags, bowls of sweets and motivational wall quotes (“Don’t wait to be asked” “Go beyond yourself”), the staff of 39 drawn from 15 different nationalities work to link roving digital workers with employers across the globe.Jobbatical’s founder and CEO, Karoli Hindriks, first discussed a digital nomad visa with Estonia’s youthful president, Kersti Kaljulaid, over a year ago, and harbours a bold dream of a future without national boundaries.“Borders are not the reflection of policy and politicians,” she said in a Ted talk delivered late last year. “They are the reflection of the borders in our heads. They are the borders that keep us from pursuing our dreams … You, me, us – we are the border guards of our lives.” Killu Vantsi at the Ministry of the Interior has the more mundane task of removing the diplomatic clouds from this blue-sky vision.“To be honest, the workforce in the globalised world is very mobile,” she says. “The rules for visas and work permits are based on the classic work situation, where you live and work in one place, but the rules have not gone together with developments in the work field. So it’s time, we think.”Roving trade, you could say, is in Tallinn’s blood. In the 850 years since it was first marked on a map by an Arab geographer, the city has played host to merchants of every stripe, drawn to its coastal position linking Europe and Russia. Since the 12th century, it has been conquered by Swedish and German armies Russia has occupied it three times, for a total of 250 years. It’s a city that understands open borders.The last time the Soviets rolled in, they stayed for most of the 20th century. So, after gaining independence in 1991, Estonia fought its way out of the resulting slump by turning to the west – and by investing heavily in digital infrastructure.Its much-publicised e-residency scheme, launched in 2014, offers citizens everywhere access to its online platforms without them having to actually live in the country. E-residents can start a business, process payments and sign documents online, just like ordinary Estonians. It is clear that Tallinn wants to court a specific type of person: the world’s laptop-wielding transnationals. Even the job title given to e-residency’s head marketer smacks of Silicon Valley: “chief evangelist”. “It’s something a lot of tech companies have,” says Adam Rang, who holds the post. “We like to think of ourselves as a government startup.”His pitch is well-polished. “People say e-residency is trying to change the world. We say no: the world has already changed. We’re trying to catch up,” he tells me at Tallinn Creative Hub. Formerly the Tallinn City Central Power Station, this brooding industrial monolith was used by Andrei Tarkovsky in his 1979 film Stalker. “We made sure Estonians can do everything online – long before digital nomads were even a thing,” says Rang. “So it makes sense that, if we’ve got those opportunities, we should offer them to non-Estonians as well.”The programme initially set the grandiose aim of 10 million “digital citizens” by 2025 it currently has 40,000, and has revised its target to 20,000 e-residency companies by 2021. Meanwhile, it is pushing ahead with a LinkedIn-style social network and an app, to be launched this summer.Officially, e-residency is not a route to full residency, but “there is a path”, Rang says. “Once e-residents travel here and start doing business with Estonian companies, it becomes very easy to take the step to live here as well.”In November, the number of monthly applications exceeded the country’s birth rate. At a time when Estonia needs to attract 440,000 immigrants just to retain its current population size of 1.3 million, e-residency and the digital nomad visa could be seen as clever border policy: with 65 million citizens going spare in the age of migration, it’s a diplomatic sleight of hand to select the digitally savvy among them.Memory here is long. Just 30 seconds’ walk from where Vantsi and her team fine-tune the country’s borderless visions are the underground cells at Pagari 1, where Estonian nationalists were interrogated by the KGB. “I don’t know an Estonian person who doesn’t have a story of somebody in their family being directly affected by being killed or being tortured, so it’s pretty raw,” says Daniel James Coll, a British Lasnamäe resident who recently ran for local government on a platform of improving infrastructure and healing isions.The city reflects this continuing mistrust. “You go to parts of Tallinn and you’ll see places that are as managed and well-kept as the best part of smaller English towns. And then you come here, and you’ll see that these crossovers are falling apart, and there’s no signage on the roads, no lines on the roads. The government just don’t bother putting money into it. It happens on every level,” says Coll. Meanwhile, cracks are forming in the digital facade. The country’s top banks have been closing the accounts of e-residents en masse, triggered by a wave of money-laundering accusations in the Baltics. On Facebook forums, debates multiply about where exactly e-residents are taxed and what the scheme entitles them to.“Right now, we’re a bit like savages. We just offer something, without knowing what the consequences might be,” says business lawyer Sten Luiga. “Government officials like e-residency, because they have something to speak about when they visit their colleagues abroad. But it is almost impossible to understand what Estonia really gains from it. And people are becoming sceptical because there are no answers.”Luiga is concerned that upscaling the project so rapidly makes it hard for Tallinn’s banking and legal communities to anticipate the risks. “The programme has been run as a startup, because our government is young and enthusiastic so they try to impress. However the government, a responsible government, can’t act in the way that startups act. Nine out of 10 startups don’t fly. You can’t shut down the only government we have because it didn’t fly.”Even more scathing about the state’s e-topian vision of a “borderless digital nation” is Dario Cavegn, a Swiss journalist at ERR, the Estonian national broadcaster. He scribbles on a piece of paper in the office’s cafeteria to show how it easy it would be for e-residents to move money out of the country through loans, default on their debts, and open another company within minutes. “You don’t know what people are using this kind of setup for. You have no idea,” he says. “The government provides a legal framework, but they haven’t taken into consideration what happens once a system like that is freely available.”In other words, it’s classic startup behaviour. With a startup, you develop a “minimum viable product”, Cavegn says, and go to market as soon as you can in a bid to attract buzz. “It’s like these guys don’t realise the real-life implications of what they’re doing, and that nothing is actually quite that simple.” He chuckles. “I would really like to know: if e-residency is so important and if everybody’s been waiting for this, where are the masses that were supposed to come kicking down our door? Where the hell are all these people?”Even the sceptics seem to agree that Tallinn is on the right track, though. The city’s youth are broadly excited about the tech scene, which they consider Estonia’s best chance of prosperity the country’s movers and shakers are young, energetic and full of ideas (Estonia’s prime minister is 39, its president 48). “Estonia had 20-odd years of independence before the second world war and the Soviet occupation, and then the utter omnishambles the place was after 1991, and they pulled themselves out of it by the boot straps,” Cavegn says. “The whole digital thing was a lifeline.” Out of its post-Soviet ruin, Tallinn has rebuilt itself as a borderless digital city of the future, moving with a speed and flexibility that older bureaucracies lack. It’s a place where ideas progress smoothly – sometimes too smoothly – from corporate thinkspace to reality, and which is cleverly positioned to attract the wandering digital workers who are predicted to number a billion by 2035.Tech idealism and state government aren’t natural bedfellows, however. Startups run on a rhetoric of irrational daring: if you can dream it, you can do it. Governments, on the other hand, have to work responsibly to protect every member of society. For all its advances, Estonia still struggles with the worst income inequality in Europe.Similarly, it’s a grand aim to conjure up a digital nomad hotspot from scratch. Tallinn has a long way to go before it catches global magnets such as Medellín or Chiang Mai, where the coconut cocktails are on tap and the sun rarely stays hidden for long. In the Estonian capital on the day the new visa was announced, it was -11C. But the culture here is of a shoot-for-the-moon optimism. “The streetlamps might be rusty and the roads might not be quite right, but what they are planning to do is running,” says Coll. “And they’re just going to keep going until it works.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d306654f72e21d96b0007bdaeb4052483ea9aa87/0_1518_2304_1382/master/2304.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f692eb535f4d70877a3e44f1bc0aa38","title":"headteachers turn charities families","story":"With schools struggling to help growing numbers of deprived pupils, we look at organisations that can offer practical supportIt was a sight Lorna Jackson, a London headteacher, had never expected to see: two pupils at her primary school sleeping behind bins at the station with their parents. “Mum, dad and the two little children were all sleeping on a mattress they’d found. The family had been evicted and the children had very little to eat.”Jackson’s school, Maryland primary in Stratford, is in a deprived area of east London. As well as suffering homelessness, her pupils are regularly victims of domestic violence. “I realised that my role had changed. Unless I addressed our children’s wellbeing, their education was not going to have impact at all.”Jackson is not alone in feeling this way. As Education   recently reported, teachers are reaching into their own pockets to pay for anything from pregnancy tests to funerals for families at their schools. But not all staff can afford this. Teachers’ charities are seeing an increase in the number of teachers who are themselves struggling to make ends meet, with twice as many education workers applying for financial assistance grants from Turn2Us in 2017, compared with 2010. When some teachers are in dire financial circumstances themselves, how can they help their pupils get the long-term support these many children so desperately need?Jackson turned to the education charity School-Home Support (SHS). Using money from her pupil premium budget, she installed an SHS practitioner in the school full time. Schools with these practitioners can access the charity’s welfare fund, which buys items for struggling families such as food, washing machines and school uniforms. The charity can also support families in navigating the benefits systems and court orders.Jackson has helped more than 100 families at her school this way. For example, her SHS practitioner realised a young pupil was stealing from classmates’ lunchboxes to feed her baby sister. The girl, her parents and her eight siblings had no access to benefits and were living in squalid accommodation and struggling to get to food banks, so the charity paid for a weekly food shop (carried out and delivered by Jackson herself), toothpaste, clothes, shoes and bedding for the children. The SHS practitioner also organised emergency help from social services and English lessons, and helped the parents find work and access child benefits. The practitioner’s placement does not always cost a school money, says the charity’s chief executive, Jaine Stannard, who urges all teachers needing help to get in touch: “Sometimes the work can be partially or fully funded by our partners, so it’s really helpful if schools register their interest.”The charity offers free membership to schools that cannot afford or do not need a full-time practitioner. This gives school staff access to SHS’s online forum, , for example, where they can ask about accessing food banks and other resources, and talk about pastoral problems.Another organisation, The Red Box Project, delivers free sanitary products to schools and colleges across the UK, and reports new schools and groups signing up each month. Freda, an online retailer of organic, eco-friendly sanitary towels and tampons, donates products to the project and allows its customers to do the same. “By providing these products for free for schoolgirls, we are allowing them to attend school all month with dignity,” says Affi Parvizi-Wayne, founder of Freda.The Trussell Trust food charity wants schools to know they can sign up to hold vouchers for their local food bank. Referring families for emergency food in the short term will not only help with families’ immediate needs, it will enable volunteers at the foodbank to talk to them about other services they can access for long-term help, the charity says.Quaker Social Action is keen to help families struggling to pay for pupils’ funerals and funeral-related debt. It also offers advice on how bereaved families can get help from employers, the government and other\u0026nbsporganisations and can put families in contact with children’s funeral directors who may be willing to waive their costs.“In the past, we’ve had a headteacher get in touch after becoming concerned about a pupil’s situation at home after a parental bereavement,” says spokesperson Giles Robinson. “Our advice on ways to raise money and heavily reduce cost can help families like this avoid debt and further grief.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/047ef4a06feae1970b164b26071ec36a2b53f531/0_150_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=290d84e3f25d9c65194477218d1710d4","title":"these tests only measure a little bit of you the teachers letters that go viral","story":"Sats tests for primary pupils in England are time for teachers’ encouragement to go viral on social mediaIt is a ritual almost as established as the exams themselves, but with the year 6 Sats tests for primary school pupils in England starting this week, it is also that time of year when encouraging notes and messages from schools and teachers get the opportunity to go viral on social media.This year, one of the notes to gain national attention has come from Micklands primary school’s headteacher, Mark Frost. In it, he tells pupils “Here is what you need to do over the weekend in order to be fully prepared for the tests.”The letter then goes on to list such activities as reading a book, playing on a computer or games console, playing board games, or watching films. The letter also encouraged pupils to “spend home time with your family and people you love” and advised that “the weather for the weekend looks good. Get yourself outside for a game of football, cricket or whatever sport you enjoy. Go for a walk or run, climb a tree anything that will get your heart pumping a little. Remember that exercise lowers your stress levels, makes you feel happy and more alert.”The Sats, or national curriculum assessments as they are formally known, test pupils against key stages 1 and 2 of the national curriculum. The majority of pupils taking the tests are aged seven or 11.Another head, John Newport at Marden Bridge middle shool in Whitley Bay, sent pupils a letter last week stating: “Please remember, when you open your first test on Monday morning, a test is all it is. It will not define who you are, you are worth more and are better than that. You are a strong, resilient member of our community and people will think highly of you because of this and not because of how many questions you can answer. You can rest assured that because of the hard work you have put in you should feel confident with these tests. Please do not let them worry you.”It went on to say: “They do not know that some of you speak two languages or that you love to sing or draw. They have not seen your natural talent for dancing or playing a musical instrument. They do not know that your friends can count on you to be there for them that your laughter can brighten the darkest day or that your face turns red when you feel shy. They do not know that you participate in sports, wonder about the future or sometimes help your little brother or sister after school.”The precise format of this text seems to have first become popular in 2015, when a similar letter from Buckton Vale primary school was featured on ITV’s This Morning show and additionally tweeted by presenter Phillip Schofield.Some schools have helped children to prepare for this week’s tests by offering a free breakfast club during the week, to ensure children arrive on time and well fed for their exams – with some even promising the bonus of bacon sandwiches for breakfast on Friday.It isn’t just before the exams that encouraging words from a school can gain huge public recognition. Last year after the results came out, a kind letter sent out following the results of the tests was also widely shared.Sats tests have proved unpopular with many parents – and activist groups like Let Our Kids Be Kids have campaigned against them, and also encouraged parents to boycott the tests. As well as the pressure the exams put on pupils, critics are unhappy with the content of the tests, which focus on rigid interpretations of grammar and force pupils to use specific parts of speech in the English language.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), representing about 18,000 school leaders, has cautioned parents against this. Last month Julie McCulloch, ASCL’s interim director of policy, told Schools Week newspaper: “We would advise parents against withdrawing their children from key stage 2 tests” as they “help secondary schools know how much support they may need to give to a child”.The row over the exams has not stopped teachers doing their best to relax and encourage pupils before facing the tests. The letter sent to pupils this year at Micklands ends: “Remember that Sats do not test the following qualities: compassion, creativity, happiness, love, generosity, confidence, kindness, faith, bravery and many more things that are far more important in life than long ision and adverbial phrases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0de222efac3e6f9f13488d73f607c41c7922b71f/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24038419075b74dc8a0b2fc0fb49acd6","title":"vomitive pathetic lars von trier film prompts mass walkouts at cannes","story":"More than 100 people said to have exited early from a screening for The House That Jack Built, which features scenes of duckling mutilation and child killingDanish director Lars Von Trier’s much-anticipated return to Cannes has resulted – with some predictability – in controversy, as a screening of his new film The House That Jack Built was met with mass walkouts.The blackly comic thriller, which stars Matt Dillon and Uma Thurman, follows the murder spree of a serial killer over the course of several decades. Advance word on the film suggested that it would feature scenes of sadistic violence and brutality, with Cannes director Thierry Fremaux saying that it featured “a subject so controversial” that it could only appear in an out-of-competition slot at the festival.That advance billing seems to have been lived up to, with Variety’s Ramin Setoodeh reporting more than 100 people leaving the cinema prematurely due to the film’s “disgusting” content. “Gross. Pretentious. Vomitive. Torturous. Pathetic”, wrote one attendee on Twitter, while entertainment reporter Roger Friedman described it as a “vile movie” that “should not have been made”. “He mutilates Riley Keough, he mutilates children... and we are all there in formal dress expected to watch it?” another viewer told Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan. Al Jazeera’s Charlie Angela also left the screening early, stating that “seeing children being shot and killed is not art or entertainment”.The scene which seems to have prompted the majority of walkouts is one in which Dillon’s character shoots two children at a family picnic in the head with a rifle. In another Keogh’s character is seen having her breast sliced off, while a flashback scene shows a child removing a duckling’s leg with a pair of pliers. Archive footage from concentration camps is also shown.Von Trier was making his first appearance on the Croisette since being declared “persona not grata” by the festival over a 2011 press conference in which he joked about sympathising with the Nazis. At the time the Cannes board declared the director’s comments “unacceptable, intolerable, and contrary to the ideals of humanity and generosity that preside over the very existence of the festival”. However, last month Cannes overturned the ban, with Fremaux saying that it was a “punishment that was disproportionate and that had lasted long enough”. That decision was greeted negatively in some quarters, with critics pointing to allegations made by the musician Björk, who said that Von Trier had sexually harassed her on the set of his film Dancer in the Dark. Von Trier denies the allegations.Critical response to The House That Jack Built has been largely negative. In a two-star review, the ’s Peter Bradshaw wrote that the film was “an ordeal of gruesomeness and tiresomeness that was every bit as exasperating as I had feared”, though did admit that he was impressed by its “spectacular horror finale”. Also giving the film two stars was the ’s Robbie Collin, who wrote it “feels like way too much and nowhere near enough”, while, in an F-grade review, The Playlist’s Jessica Kiang described it as “misogynistic” and “irredeemably unpleasant”.Not everyone seems to have been appalled by The House That Jack Built, however. Setoodeh reports that the film received a standing ovation at the Cannes premiere, which prompted someone sitting near him to declare: “They’ll clap for anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db6f059548cf87ce4c740bb4fa3286358e49b950/16_21_5867_3521/master/5867.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cef09cf3ac7fd3c72c6f5ae95dbd7756 700w","title":"everton likely marco silva sam allardyce rooney","story":"• Portuguese was preferred candidate back in October• Board to meet about Allardyce and Rooney in midweekSam Allardyce is set to leave Everton this week with the former Watford and Hull City manager Marco Silva a leading candidate to replace him.Allardyce is scheduled to meet Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, in the coming days and his departure is expected to be announced by the end of the week. Allardyce is six months into the 18-month contract he secured in November and oversaw an eighth-place finish in the Premier League. But fierce opposition to his management style among the club’s supporters, allied to the hierarchy’s desire for a fresh start following a dreadful season, is likely to result in the 63-year-old leaving with a final year’s pay-off of around £6m.Everton’s board will hold meetings over several key issues this week. It is also expected to hold talks with Wayne Rooney’s representative, Paul Stretford, with the former England captain seeking clarification on his Goodison future before deciding whether to accept an offer to join DC United in the MLS.Silva is the front-runner to succeed Allardyce having been Moshiri’s preferred appointment when he sacked Ronald Koeman on 23 October. Hopes of a swift transition may be complicated, however, by a legal dispute between the Portuguese coach and Watford.Watford sacked Silva in January following a run of one win in 11 matches. The club claimed in a statement that an “unwarranted approach by a Premier League rival” – Everton – led to a significant deterioration in Silva’s focus and results. The manager believed he was sacked prematurely and that he is owed six months’ salary, £750,000, and remains in legal dispute with his former employer over his settlement terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/055bf471d068545b95d70d3d3589b8f964e72eb6/70_66_1807_1084/master/1807.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e826165bce03830a031e243335665fb","title":"harry kane mo salah golden boot new heights tottenham liverpool","story":"• Manager will need to balance new signings with outgoings• Mousa Dembélé, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld could leaveMauricio Pochettino wants his demand for bravery and risk-taking in the summer transfer market to extend to swift decisions over the players he is willing to sell – namely Mousa Dembélé, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld.The Tottenham manager is determined to improve his squad after a third-place Premier League finish in order to take the final step to trophies next season and he would love Daniel Levy, the chairman, to sanction a massive investment drive.In his heart Pochettino knows that is unrealistic he will continue to have to balance signings with outgoings because of the repayment costs associated with the club’s £850m new stadium.Yet he is keen for there to be clarity over the assets in the squad on which he could cash in – and it means doing early business with them to give him greater flexibility on his signings. The transfer window in England closes on 8 August.It will doubtless disappoint some fans and players that Pochettino is prepared to consider offers for Dembélé – most of the playing staff rate the midfielder as their No 1 team‑mate. But there are concerns over his fitness – whether he can stay the course, in physical terms, for another season in England.Dembélé had ankle surgery last summer, started this season slowly and finished it back in the treatment room with an ankle injury. The 30-year-old could be tempted by a final major pay day in China, where Beijing Guoan are interested in him. He has one year to run on his contract.Rose blotted his copybook last August when he gave an interview in which he urged the club to sign more world-class players and made plain his frustrations at the wage structure. Everton want the left-back this summer.Alderweireld’s situation has been well documented. Tottenham stand to lose him for £25m next summer because of a release clause in his contract and consequently they are keen to get more for him now. The centre-half has played six times for the club since 1 November, when he injured a hamstring, and the problem could be that his suitors would want him to prove his form and fitness at the World Cup for Belgium before they move for him.Pochettino was outspoken after his team’s final game of the season on Sunday – the 5-4 Wembley win against Leicester – when he prodded Levy over squad strengthening. It felt as though he was flexing his muscles from a position of power, the club having once again qualified for the Champions League, and it might not be coincidence that Pochettino is in talks over a new contract.Pochettino was also seeking to mark his turf over the type of player he wants to sign. Typically Levy has preferred younger ones with resale value but Pochettino would like him to consider more seasoned professionals.Harry Kane has said the emergence of Mohamed Salah at Liverpool has driven him to new heights. The Tottenham striker finished the season with a career-best 30 Premier League goals, though it was not enough for him to win the Golden Boot for a third year in succession.Salah took the award with 32 goals, a record for a 38-game season. Kane scored 25 in 2015-16 and 29 in 2016-17 and he got 21 in 2014-15 when he finished as runner-up to Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero in the Golden Boot.

Without warning her mother would uproot the family and move. She learned it was because they were hiding from the Mafia. But years later she discovered the truthPauline Dakin was always aware her childhood was a long way from ordinary. Her parents, Warren and Ruth, separated when she was five – she knew her father had a drink problem and could be violent. Pauline, her mother and her little brother Ted moved around a lot. When Pauline was nine, her mother packed up a Volkswagen camper van in Vancouver for a holiday in Winnipeg, more than 1,000 miles away. When they got there, over a mug of cocoa, the children learned they were never going home.“That summer of 1974 was the last time I thought of my family as having any relation to normal,” writes Pauline in her memoir, Run Hide Repeat. “The events that followed made Ted and I know we were different, somehow apart. Ted would sometimes, in the years that followed, refer to ‘normal families’. Not in a critical way, but in a straightforward acknowledgment that we were not one.”Over seven years, Pauline attended six different schools. The next major relocation came when she was 13, when she was finally settled in a school she liked, had close friends and was starting to be interested in boys. This time, Ruth actually told them where they were going: all the way to New Brunswick, in the far east of Canada. Pauline and Ted were sworn to secrecy, but she broke ranks and told her best friend Wendy. When Ruth picked her up from Wendy’s house, the girls had to affect “breezy see-you-laters” so Pauline’s mother wouldn’t suspect.Ruth promised her children that one day everything would be made clear. Why they couldn’t tell anyone where they were going on holiday. Why they couldn’t even say if they were going out for dinner. Pauline heard the brush-off, “I’ll explain when you’re older,” again and again. Then, when she was 23, her mother invited her to meet her at a motel – she was ready to talk. But the explanation would be far more complicated, and more terrifying, than she could ever have dreamed.It was late February 1988, and when Pauline walked into the motel room with her mother, a man was waiting. Pauline knew him well: it was the Reverend Stan Sears, a minister with the United Church who had been part of their lives since her parents separated. Even when they moved, Sears was never far behind. So it was a surprise, but not a total shock, when they told her that they were in love. For many years, they hadn’t acted on their attraction – Sears was married, for one thing – but now they agreed they wanted to live together.A far more profound revelation was to come, however. Her mother and Sears explained that the reason the family had moved so often, so haphazardly, was that Warren, Pauline’s father, was a mobster, a key member of an organised crime syndicate in Vancouver. When they separated, Ruth had a contract put on her. Sears, meanwhile, had become implicated when he’d acted as a counsellor first to another repentant mobster, who he said had quickly been assassinated, and then to Ruth. He also had a contract put on his life.Over the weekend, Ruth and Sears filled out the details. When, out of nowhere, Pauline and Ted had been pulled from school and gone bowling, or when Ruth had emptied the entire contents of their fridge into the bin, that was because Sears had received intel that the Mafia was planning an attempt on their lives. On another occasion, the family had to scrub their feet in the bath and put plastic bags over their socks. That was, she now learned, because their carpets had been sprinkled with poison.Where did his information come from? Sears explained he had a direct connection (by a beeper he kept in his back pocket) to a shadowy government agency, who had undercover officers who collected intelligence and offered protection for people under threat from organised crime. It was a lot for Pauline to take in. A young journalist, she was working for a local newspaper and had been trained to question everything. But Sears offered intricate, compelling detail. A whole new language. The organised crime soldiers were, in his terminology, “the O” . The “Weird World” was a sort of witness-protection village, where people were secreted for their safety. Sears had moved into one, deep in the wilderness in British Columbia, and Ruth would join him. The community named it “Place of Hope” or “PH”.As much as Pauline was sceptical, these brain-scrambling stories had a twisted logic, particularly in the context of her life to that point. “As awful as the scenario might be, this explanation could mean that at least my family wasn’t just odd or crazy,” she writes. After the weekend in the motel, Pauline left with a transmitter in her car and a small transistor radio, rigged so she could call for help.This was how life went on for five years. Pauline spent a lot of time looking over her shoulder, and Sears appeared sporadically with updates. She broke up with one serious boyfriend because she didn’t dare tell him about the Weird World. When Ted got married in 1990, Sears revealed that some of the guests were actually doubles. These doppelgängers included Pauline’s aunt Penny and even her father, who she had only seen once in the previous decade. Both sides – “the good guys” and the Mafia – used doubles, Sears told her, and plastic surgery and prosthetics ensured the disguises were perfect.Doubles had a certain amount of political currency: Stalin and Hitler were famously alleged to have used decoys then there were claims in the 1990s that Manuel Noriega and Fidel Castro, the leaders of Panama and Cuba respectively, employed them. But Pauline was deeply conflicted. She stared at a small yellow naevus that her impostor father had in the cornea of his right eye and wondered how it could be replicated. Still, when Warren asked her to come to his hotel room she wriggled out of it. She believed she would be hurt or kidnapped. And her mother seemed flustered, too, becoming fixated on the toes of her sister Penny’s double. “Even if she had plastic surgery, how could they copy her bone structure?” she fretted.But despite these doubts, Pauline went deeper and deeper. She had met and married Kevin – neither her father nor his double attended the ceremony, and Sears gave her away – and told Kevin all about the Weird World. Eventually, the couple decided that they would join Ruth and Sears in Place of Hope. Preparations were so advanced that Pauline looked at a carpet sample for the cabin where they would live.Then, in 1993, aged 28, her world came crashing down for a second time. Exhausted by the ever-present fear and suspicion, and sensing that Sears’s stories weren’t quite stacking up, Pauline set up a sting. She told her mother that her house had been broken into. Ruth in turn informed Sears, and Sears came back with an involved story of how two people from the O had forced entry into her house, looking for a present from her father. Of course, the burglary never happened. In the moment after this revelation, Pauline was furious, but also bereft.“All the moves and disappearances all the running all the sick, terrifying stories all the upheaval all the isolation,” she recalls in Run Hide Repeat. “It was all because of a lie. A fucking lie. All made up. All the layered creation of the brilliant, twisted imagination of this man whom I’d chosen to love and trust as a father. I was shattered.”It’s an unseasonably sunny April morning when I catch up with Pauline on Skype. She is 53 now and has long, silvery-blonde hair and intense blue eyes Ashley Jensen’s agent should keep an eye open for the inevitable film adaptation. She sits in her light-filled kitchen in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and her dog noisily eats breakfast in the background. Much has happened in the 25 years since she began to have doubts about the Weird World. She’s had two daughters, now 21 and 19. The Reverend Stan Sears died in 2005, her mother followed in 2010.Pauline’s manner is brisk, no nonsense. When she wrote Run Hide Repeat, she feared readers would think that she and her family were fools: “I was sure people would say, ‘God, you were so naive. How could you be so gullible?’” she says. Instead, she comes across as very level-headed and sensible. For most of her professional life, she has worked as a reporter, mainly on radio and TV for the national broadcaster CBC. In later years, she has chosen to specialise in health and medical stories – facts and evidence are important to her.Since she exposed Sears’s extraordinary fraud, Pauline has had therapy, but she believes the greatest impact on her recovery has been working on her book. “Really, it’s the best thing I ever did for myself, to say: ‘Let’s go back and look at this.’”For a long time, Pauline blamed her mother: for so faithfully believing Sears for failing in her parental responsibility to protect her and Ted. Ruth could never let go of the alternative world that he created. She and Pauline eventually settled on an unspoken pact not to discuss what had happened. This held until shortly before Ruth died from ovarian cancer. Then she said: “Oh, Pauline, if you think I’m crazy for believing, how you must have hated me.”Considerable solace came when Pauline was able to put a name to what Sears was suffering from. At different points, she had considered and rejected psychosis, schizophrenia, paranoia and folie à deux, where delusional beliefs are passed from one dominating person to another more submissive one. Then, one day about four years ago, she read about a rare condition called delusional disorder. This typically comes on later in life and – unlike many other psychiatric conditions – the sufferer experiences delusions, but in many other ways behaves entirely normally. This, Pauline believes, perfectly sums up Sears, who was a well-respected, pillar- of-the-community type.“He was a very compelling guy,” she says. “He was just so intelligent, but also funny and he really connected with people. When he talked to you he really listened. You felt very heard.“In many ways, Stan was quite brilliant,” Pauline goes on. “He had an amazing mind and that allowed his delusion to become that much more complex. There was an entire cast of characters. It was like a Rolodex and he always knew who they were and the stories that were related to them. It was quite remarkable – I could not do that.”Can she forgive Sears? Pauline goes silent for a few seconds before answering. “The discovery of delusional disorder just unlocked everything for me, and allowed me some understanding of why all this crazy stuff had happened,” she says. “But also it let me realise that Stan was not malevolent, he wasn’t trying to hurt us. We just got caught up in his illness. I didn’t have to be so angry and bitter. I could move on with my life.”There has, though, clearly been considerable collateral damage from Sears’s fantastical inventions. Pauline and Kevin have orced, and she accepts that their experiences with the Weird World made their life together very difficult.“The thing I’ve realised is that having a secret isolates you from everybody,” she says. “It means you can never truly be known by somebody and there is always this barrier between you. You feel as if you are fooling people – and that doesn’t feel good.”Pauline did eventually re-establish a relationship with Warren, her father, but she never told him about the hoax that he had unwittingly been caught up in before he died. “I was afraid to tell him for his own health. And I just couldn’t see what was to be gained.”Run Hide Repeat has been a hit, especially in Canada, and Pauline insists that life is good now. There are early-stage discussions about adapting her memoir for the screen but Pauline fears her story might be turned into a schlocky soap opera.“I feel as though somebody would look at Stan and say he’s the evil bad guy without acknowledging that in many ways he played a really supportive role in my family’s life,” she says, and then pauses. “I understand the irony of that statement. And my mother was a complex and really smart person, too. I don’t want to ever see her portrayed as some wacky woman that fell for a guy.”Now, Pauline says there’s nothing she would change about her childhood. “I have a great appreciation for my mom. She caused a lot of chaos, but she really did believe she was protecting us. She was gullible to this situation but in many ways she was very wise. Right now, I’m very happy and I have these two great kids, so I can’t imagine wanting to change.” Then, a very rueful smile. “But it’s taken some work to get that point.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d163c25b6605e476b34cf1d229a93c4fbb6d8e/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60befe058d6e5602ceedb9d0a3abd383","title":"africa female rising stars business second class citizens afua osei","story":"Despite the compelling narrative about African women becoming titans of industry, sexism and inequality make scaling up impossible for many entrepreneursAfrica is building up a glowing reputation as the global leader in female entrepreneurship. Last year, MasterCard released its celebratory Index of Women Entrepreneurs to much fanfare. Uganda and Botswana topped the list, which further pushed the new narrative that women are rising above adverse circumstances to create businesses that will rev the engine of growth in sub-Saharan Africa.Unfortunately, few have been willing to admit that this story, satisfying though it may be, is incomplete at best. The high levels of labour force participation that earn commendations mask the persistence of significant, structural limitations on female business-owners.The potential for women to create and lead businesses that will drive African growth into the next century is massive, but women’s ability to deliver on this potential is tightly constrained by a lack of access to support services, sponsorship from business leaders, and supply chains. Pervasive sexism and structural inequalities have created a troubling dichotomy – glorification of African artisans and farmers who are women, but little true interest in cultivating rising female industry leaders.Many African women work in traditional sectors such as food and cosmetics, but barriers to entry are too high for them to transform from subsistence enterprises to transformational businesses. In Nigeria, to gain approval to manufacture food and beauty products, one must jump through hoops to obtain an expensive licence from the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control. Given that women are more likely to be poor, are more likely to be primary caregivers, and are less likely to be educated, they frequently lack the time and resources to overcome such bureaucratic hurdles.To harness the potential of female entrepreneurs, the aggregation of business support services and infrastructure is essential. This approach has proven its value in Africa already. Four out of five female businesswomen spotlighted by the World Economic Forum mention pooling resources and sharing best practices among other trailblazers as crucial to their success and central to their work. While tech hubs and innovation labs like pan-African Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (Mest) and Impact Hub have provided support by pooling resources, they can realistically only service a couple of hundred entrepreneurs at any given time. More robust government support is required to provide resources for millions of female entrepreneurs across the region.Among those who overcome the hurdles and get products to market, many lack the mentorship and sponsorship that could help them take their business to a higher level. Mentors typically share advice whereas sponsors leverage connections or finances to help another person succeed. Studies around the world have consistently shown that sponsorship makes a critical difference in career success, and women disproportionately lack this type of support. African women who have managed to build large businesses cite their mentors and sponsors as crucial to their rise. Financial inclusion remains a serious issue. Women still lack access to banking, let alone the capital needed to grow a business. Much of the support for women-owned businesses has focused on local, micro-finance backed, consumer goods production. These businesses start small and largely stay small. If African female entrepreneurs are to scale up, we must provide them with a platform to do so. Global networks like WEConnect International, which links female-owned businesses to buyers around the world, is attempting to do just that, but we need more efforts like this to make a real impact.Almost 20 years ago, development institutions began to realise that women’s reliability, drive to support their families, and labour potential made them uniquely productive in developing economies. The same characteristics said to enable female productivity on a micro-level are now being used to characterise a class of African female entrepreneurs with global potential. Programmes and reporters praise these women for their grit, but treat them as second-class citizens by rarely providing them with tools to scale from local to global.Rather than perpetuate a misleading narrative around the African businesswoman, investors, employers, and governments should all take steps to identify and nurture female talent, lower barriers to entry, and ensure greater access to markets to create a new generation of titans of industry.

But do you really need to carry your pet bunny instead of a bouquet and hashtag the hell out of the big day?Still, at this time of year, and with a royal wedding now tantalisingly close, it is worth considering how much weddings have changed in the past few years. These days, most of us get married later – 35 for women and 37 for men – often after years of cohabitation and frequently after parenthood. We have same-sex weddings, friends as celebrants, male bridesmaids, orced in-laws, second marriages, pies instead of fruitcake, and weddings on submarines and beaches and the London Eye, all of which demands a new kind of wedding etiquette.Let us consider the cautionary tale of Jeni Arrowsmith and Mark Wood, a couple from Wrexham who recently hired an owl to deliver their wedding rings. Sadly, after Bobby the barn owl had made his flight across the church, the waiting best man struggled to unclip the rings from his claw. Bobby became agitated and, distracted by an arm movement, descended on one of the groomsmen, who happened to have a terrible fear of birds. Despite the chance of such rogue turn of events, an increasing number of couples do choose to involve animals in their weddings, particularly their own pets. “Dogs are very common now, especially at the festival, boho, outside weddings,” says Kat Williams, the founder of the alternative wedding blog Rock n Roll Bride.Williams recalls a bride who walked down the aisle carrying her pet rabbit rather than a bouquet, and tells how her own sister employed a small herd of llamas to greet guests at her reception. But it is important to remember that the wellbeing of your beasts remains the priority – they should be fed, watered and cared for, and, should you be hiring them just for the day, you have a responsibility to investigate the credentials of the company you contract. Finally, keep in mind the solemn words of Anne-Marie Curtis, the editor-in-chief of Elle Wedding: “Introducing animals to a wedding can overcomplicate something that is already quite complicated.”One of the principal duties of bridesmaids used to be to confuse evil spirits and jealous suitors who might try to snaffle away the bride before she could even say her vows. They did this by cunningly dressing identically to the bride and similarly veiling their faces. Today, they perform the same duty more subtly – by wearing matching satin 50s numbers from Monsoon and mainlining enough prosecco to become incomprehensible by 7pm. Nevertheless, some brides have begun to break with convention here. “Some people do still want to have six child bridesmaids scattering rose petals,” says Curtis, “but you can also just have one friend,” and this could be a male friend. Williams notes the identical dresses are also on the wane, and these days “the mismatched look is really popular. So you might choose the same dress in different colours, or pick a colour and let your bridesmaids choose a dress style that fits their shape.” That should certainly keep the evil spirits on their toes.In the good old days you knew exactly where you were with speeches: a few tender words, thanks, and compliments to the bridesmaids from the groom, a misty-eyed tribute from the father of the bride, and a kind but fruity performance from the best man with no more than three allusions to previous girlfriends and whatever may or may not have gone on during the stag weekend in Magaluf. It was the point in a wedding day where guests could sit back and wonder at the simple glory of men speaking, very much like a boardroom meeting, or party conference, or a BBC panel game or, well, most situations in life ever. Sadly, since approximately 2014, women have been tiresomely harping on about their right to speak too, and now weddings frequently feature speeches from brides, bridesmaids and brides’ mothers. “Generally, weddings are events where you attend to tradition, but a lot of brides are questioning and challenging that tradition,” says Lucy Hume, an associate director at Debrett’s, which offers a wedding handbook and consultancy service. She advises that, especially if the wedding features more than three speakers, “ideally your speech should last around 10 minutes”. For anyone giving a best man or best woman’s speech, it is best to avoid props. “It’s always the best men who get out the PowerPoint presentation and everyone groans,” says Williams. “I think that’s on the way out.” And as far as risque anecdotes are concerned, she believes most guests are fairly unshockable these days. Still, she says, a good rule of thumb is: “Is the bride or groom going to kill you? Because it’s a fine line between embarrassing them and mortifying them.”Getting married in a technological age throws up many conundrums. Should you liveblog your vows? Ought you to invite Alexa to the wedding? Chief among them is the role of mobile phones and social media. Some couples opt for entirely phone-free weddings, while others encourage you to hashtag the hell out of the nuptials. “There’s no official etiquette,” says Hume. “Except when it comes to the ceremony, and then the celebrant may ask guests not to take photographs.” And some of it is plain common sense – what bride wants to see a video of herself dancing to Cardi B on a trestle table at 3am with the caption #helenandsuewed? Williams notes the futility of guests recording the ceremony on their phones: “It’s like being at a gig and there’s a sea of phones and you think, ‘When are you ever going to watch that?’” And it is perhaps best to ignore the whole idea of social media. “I think the pressure to post on the day adds a whole level of stress,” says Curtis. “And you really want to immerse yourself in the day itself.” Still, says Williams, “A social media ban is a bit harsh. It’s not the Met Gala.”It is easy to forget that in the olden days couples did not live together before marriage, setting up home together only after the big day. Wedding gift lists hail from this time and were designed to soften the blow when you realised that you had committed yourself to a lifetime with a man who eats with his mouth open, or a woman who sniffs – quietly, perhaps, but with the soul-destroying persistence of a dripping tap. Do gift lists really have any place in the modern world where most couples cohabit before they marry? “It really depends what life stage you’re at,” says Curtis. “It’s not necessarily about needing to set up house, but I think as a rule some kind of list can be helpful to guests.” Asking for cold hard cash is unfortunately still a touch outre. “There is still a resistance to people asking for it,” says Hume, although Williams points out that some wedding-list sites offer a monetary option. “If it goes through a company it feels less like you’re asking for cash in an envelope,” she says. Alternatively, you could suggest guests make donations to charity – although this can bring its own issues. For instance, my ex-husband and I are still joint owners of a small copse in east Lancashire as a result of our effort to hold a carbon-neutral wedding by encouraging guests to give to a tree-planting charity. We have not discussed visitation rights.Hen and stag dos are, according to Williams, “more popular than ever”, with some brides and grooms choosing to have more than one – a thought frankly more terrifying for the residents of Blackpool than the prospect of fracking on the Fylde coast. The thing to remember, says Curtis, is that hen or stag dos need not be expensive, elaborative or exclusive. “In this time-poor age, a hen or a stag do can be a nice way to spend time together, but everyone should be in agreement you have to make sure everybody’s comfortable and everybody’s having fun.” This extends, of course, to those employed to assist your event, be that the model in your life-drawing class, the waitress at your dinner or any member of the Chippendales. Such occasions are not an excuse to act like a boorish wazzock, even if you are dressed as She-Ra and chained to a unicycle.Approximately five years ago, surprise choreography became an almost inescapable part of wedding theatre – brides backflipping down the aisle, flashmobs, first dances where the ballad screeched to a halt and the happy couple suddenly launched into an elaborately well-rehearsed routine to Sir Mix-a-Lot. Indeed, it is now something of a relief for an entire wedding dance to go by without a romantic Uptown Funk breakout. “Maybe we have reached peak first dance,” says Hume, although she adds that there is really nothing wrong with a couple taking a preparatory class or two if they feel nervous about dancing in front of their guests. The performative moments of a wedding are a result of not just our wearisome social media age, but, says Curtis, an increasing pressure for couples to make their weddings feel more personal. “We’re all much bigger showoffs than we used to be,” she says. “And making a wedding more personal can become harder because there are no rules to follow. In some ways, it might have been easier when the bride’s parents paid for everything and you all trundled off down to the local church. But, you know, the best parts of any wedding are always the unchoreographed, unplanned moments.”Williams says that one of the questions she is most frequently asked by prospective brides is how to tell guests that their wedding will be child-free. “Children get bored, they need entertaining, and having them there can cost as much as having an adult guest.” Child-free weddings are increasingly common, and she advises making sure that this is stated on the invitation, telephoning any guests who might particularly object. For those who do invite children, be prepared to accommodate breastfeeding, potty-training, high chairs and perhaps squalling tantrums of boredom during Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians (although, in many ways, perhaps they will be speaking for everyone).Any knotty family matters – orced parents, old feuds, disapproval of a same-sex union – should be approached kindly and openly well before the big day. “Divorced parents are one of the common challenges people come to us for advice about,” says Hume. “We advocate a frank, open conversation from the outset.” She often suggests couples find a way for step-parents to be involved: one parent walking a bride down the aisle and another giving the speech, for instance. “Weddings are emotional subjects and you can be surprised by how excited people can get about them,” she says. Any guest who doesn’t respect the occasion should be treated in much the same way as that tantrumming toddler stropping their way through the ceremony: take them outside and give them a calm but firm talking to, well away from other guests. Remember that a wedding is about making sure everyone feels welcome, about celebration and love – things that it is sometimes easy to forget amid all the hashtags, wedding lists and barn owls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e26462737134ed2786a4ac36418a131d0346fbdc/457_418_2596_1558/master/2596.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b28487ac7115085469349a70afe2b77e","title":"tamal ray recipe sticky hazelnut date pretzel buns","story":"I’ve become addicted to these buns as a speedy breakfast to have on the go, quietly cursing the snooze function on my alarm when I’m rushing to work.

The leavers were engaged in a collective act of self-delusion and it was time for MPs to put the national interest first and stay in the customs union and the single market. Miliband and Clegg then got to do their brief solos, which more or less echoed what Morgan had already said. Then it was all over. Thank you and good night.Once the four-second ovation had died down, it was time for the encore. Or at least questions. Most of which verged on the existential. Why them? Why now? Why here? Hadn’t all this already been said countless times already? No one really seemed to have a very satisfactory answer. Some things just were what they were.The greatest confusion centred on why Miliband had suddenly decided to drop in on the UK after five years in the US to give us his Brexit thoughts. David appeared nonplussed. His was the highest calling. He was here because he was the Saviour™. And it was his duty to come back every now and again to remind us of what we were missing. That’s what Saviours™ did. They let us know how things could have been if only we had kept the faith. It was his act of kindness to an ungrateful nation.It had been like this: he had been hanging out in New York, jamming with a few dudes, when he’d got the phone call from Nick and Nicky. And he just couldn’t resist the chance of playing a UK gig with such iconic political figures. So he’d dropped everything, taken the red-eye – business class, of course: every Messiah deserved a break – to London, done a quick tour of the Today studios and here he was. Playing to 20,000 bags of rice. You Win a Grain.“Bregsit is a tragedy,” he crooned. He pronounces Brexit in exactly the same way as Tony Blair. It must be a New Labour thing. “But it doesn’t have to be a choice between a hard Bregsit and a chaotic Bregsit.”Did this signal a return to British politics, or was it just a one-off appearance? “It’s not the beginning, middle or end of anything,” Miliband said gnomically. He wasn’t here to start a new cross-party anti-Bregsit group. He was just here. To make a contribution. To serve and to save. He might be back at some point. And there again, he might not be. He was like the wind. A prophet is not without honour except in his own land. David wiped away a tear.It wasn’t long before someone asked about the artistic differences in the 2010 supergroup, the Dave and Ed Mili Band. Were the two brothers still talking after that difficult second album? David suddenly went all coy. What went on between him and Ed had always been private and he was going to keep it that way. Which came as news to everyone who had witnessed their very public bust-up over the leadership of the Labour party.Morgan then fielded a few questions before realising that no one had wanted to ask Clegg anything. The drummer’s lot. She generously chose to allow him to have the last word. “Never underestimate the narcissism of the Brexiters,” he declared.And never underestimate the narcissism of former politicians who fail to realise that the public is no longer that interested in what they have to say. Who just can’t bear to confront the silence of their mortality. David, Nick and Nicky had spoken. But almost no one had listened. Though maybe that had been the point all along. As a metaphor for the futility of Brexit, it couldn’t have been bettered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3827d22c6d98c0811552309c27d105653bd872/0_266_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90311156d58a51d045949b258d8c3d2e","title":"norway style option after brexit cant be considered corbyn tells mps","story":"Labour leader tells MPs that EEA membership would leave Britain as a ‘rule taker’ without influence at European Union levelJeremy Corbyn has told Labour MPs that a Norway-style option cannot be considered by the party, but faces a party split after rebel Lords passed an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill which would keep membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) as an option.Speaking at a private meeting of MPs in parliament, Corbyn told them there were significant issues with the Norway-option, which could leave Britain as “rule taker” without influence at EU level. He emphasised the need to unite both leave and remain supporters, according to a senior Labour source.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.EEA membership, often described as the Norway option gives countries full access to the EU’s internal market, allowing it to trade goods with EU states without customs fees, except food and drinks which are subsidised by the EU. Iceland and Liechtenstein are also members of the EEA, but the terms mean accepting freedom of movement and, as a non-EU state, the UK would have to accept EU regulations with no seat at the table in Brussels.MP John Mann warned that Labour would lose seats like his in Bassetlaw if it was perceived that the party had “watered down” its Brexit position.Other Labour MPs also cautioned against any option which would mean retaining free movement. Sources said MPs warned colleagues that consideration of an EEA option would leave Labour vulnerable not just with leave voters, but the large percentage of remain voters who also wanted changes to free movement.Others at the meeting made passionate speeches in favour of keeping an open mind about a Norway-style option. One source said Hilary Benn, the chair of the Brexit select committee, said Corbyn should not take options off the table.Several Labour MPs in the room said Corbyn had not been definitive in his opposition to EEA membership, and did not categorically rule it out, but Mann said the strength of feeling in the room from other speakers against the option had “killed it off”.“It was more than half the people that spoke, it was quite a significant moment in my view,” Mann said. “It was people who have not spoken out before, from areas like mine. They have never voted in favour of Brexit before, they voted remain.”A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.A senior Labour source said whipping arrangements for the EEA amendment passed by the Lords had not been discussed for when the EU withdrawal bill returned to parliament, but said Corbyn had made his opposition to a Norway-style deal.“Jeremy made clear that from our point of view, we have set out our priorities for the Brexit negotiations, including negotiating a new customs union with the EU with Britain having a day in trade details, and a new and strong relationship with the single market, retaining the benefits ... we’ve set that out since the beginning,” the source said.“The EEA packages that are currently in existence do not meet the needs and priorities that we’ve set out and the Norway option is not appropriate and will not work for the kind of Brexit we want to see.”Separately, Labour sources said MP Wes Streeting challenged Corbyn in the meeting about the party’s local government election result in Barnet, where Labour failed to take the council amid accusations of antisemitism in the party.A Labour source said Corbyn “does think antisemitism played a role in the Barnet election result ... Jeremy made clear as he set out in public statements, he is determined to eradicate anti-semitism in the party and will not tolerate it”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c71bb366b5fa8b7fdd43daba3ae5353fd6dfe16a/21_0_3959_2375/master/3959.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eae7d9af004f4e1f3a121bd363177b58","title":"pessimism about customs impasse after rees mogg remarks","story":"Rees-Mogg has said hard Brexiters will not back down, as subcommittee prepares to meetTheresa May’s inner Brexit cabinet is preparing to meet again, with ministers pessimistic about breaking the customs deadlock after Jacob Rees-Mogg said hard Brexit MPs would not back down.Ahead of the subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, Rees-Mogg, who heads the European Research Group of pro-Brexit Conservative MPs, said he was not minded to take a more conciliatory position. “If we were to do so it would completely undermine the heart of why we voted to leave, rendering our almost-reclaimed sovereignty a myth,” he said.He repeated calls for Britain to walk away from the negotiations if the options May gave the European commission were rejected. “The UK will simply have to leave with no deal because the referendum result must be upheld,” he said. “Democracy is the backbone of established political societies, it fosters stability and fairness and cannot be treated so disdainfully.”Writing in the Daily , Rees-Mogg said May “ought not to take Brussels too seriously about the Irish question” when seeking a customs deal. “The commission hides behind faux concern for the Irish border undermining the single market ... We will not impose a border. If there is a deal to be done about the border it will be precisely that: a deal. Nonetheless, if one side keeps refusing to bargain, no deal will be struck.”The intervention came after May held private meetings with dozens of Conservative backbench MPs to try to explain the two options for customs arrangements with the EU. She and Rees-Mogg are reported to have clashed over the consequences for the Irish border during their meeting.The inner Brexit cabinet meets again on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the two rival plans. May still faces having to deal with a significant split among ministers over whether to back a customs partnership, where the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, or opt for the “max fac” model, which would use technology to police the border.Conservative MPs were invited to five separate sessions at the Department for Exiting the European Union, where May made introductory remarks and took questions. Her chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, then gave a “neutral, technical” presentation of both options, with MPs given the chance to press him further on the detail afterwards. A Brexiter source said the presentation had been “neutral to the point of being incoherent”.David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said the cabinet would “test proposals to destruction” and denied the arguments were coming too late in the process. “We’ve been very focused on other aspects of Brexit, agreeing the withdrawal agreement, the implementation period. The EU themselves set a timescale to discuss these issues and it’s right that we’re focusing on it now,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“We are focusing on it in a way that ensures that we get it right, that we test proposals to destruction.” Asked if that phrasing meant he agreed with Boris Johnson’s assessment that the customs partnership was “crazy”, Mundell said: “I agree with cabinet collective responsibility, we’ll look in detail at proposals that have been worked through by the sub-committees.”Before the full Brexit subcommittee meeting on Tuesday, May also faced pressure from the former John Lewis boss Andy Street, who won the West Midlands mayoralty in a surprise win over Labour last year.Street, a Tory remainer, said his region’s car industry was facing an uncertain future without a comprehensive customs deal. His remarks echo those made last week by the business secretary, Greg Clark, who favours the customs partnership option.“As the cabinet examines the different systems for administering customs after Brexit, it must ensure that whatever the final arrangements are, they sustain the manufacturing renaissance we have seen in the West Midlands,” Street wrote in the Times.He said technology would be “part of the solution” but said trade flow was crucial. “If the technology doesn’t work for car parts at Dover or Felixstowe, if there are big delays, new checks or burdensome processes to claim back customs paid, costs will go up and companies will struggle,” he said. “If we get this wrong, we will see the unintended destruction of thousands of jobs in the automotive industry in the West Midlands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779372983fb1dd65affdacc46f7ea34987eeed4e/0_885_2550_1529/master/2550.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8263b65a9ddcd8184ce2aa764a6d50b","title":"europa moon of jupiter prime candidate for alien life after water blast found","story":"Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft flew through a giant plume of water that erupted from the icy surface of Europa, new analysis showsA Nasa probe that explored Jupiter’s moon Europa flew through a giant plume of water vapour that erupted from the icy surface and reached a hundred miles high, according to a fresh analysis of the spacecraft’s data.The discovery has cemented the view among some scientists that the Jovian moon, one of four first spotted by the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610, is the most promising place in the solar system to hunt for alien life.If such geysers are common on Europa, Nasa and European Space Agency (Esa) missions that are already in the pipeline could fly through and look for signs of life in the brine, which comes from a vast subsurface ocean containing twice as much water as all the oceans on Earth.Nasa’s Galileo spacecraft spent eight years in orbit around Jupiter and made its closest pass over Europa, a moon about the size of our own, on 16 December 1997. As the probe dropped beneath an altitude of 250 miles, its sensors twitched with unexpected signals that scientists were unable to explain at the time.Now, in a new study, the researchers describe how they went back to the Galileo data after grainy images beamed home from the Hubble space telescope in 2016 showed what appeared to be plumes of water blasting from Europa’s surface. They found that a sudden blast of water from the Jovian moon explained the Galileo probe’s strange measurements.“There were some anomalous features in that close pass in December 1997 that we never fully understood,” said Margaret Kivelson, a senior scientist on the Galileo mission and emeritus professor of space physics at the University of California in Los Angeles. “We went back and looked at them more carefully and found that they were just what you’d expect if we’d flown through a plume.”On its closest flyby, Galileo swept over Europa at more than 2,230 mph. As it hurtled past, instruments onboard the probe detected a brief but dramatic twist in the magnetic field and a sudden, rapid increase in the density of plasma, or ionised gas, the spacecraft was flying through. Computer simulations created by Xianzhe Jia, a space scientist at the University of Michigan, showed that a 120-mile-high geyser erupting from a relatively warm patch on Europa would create precisely the same readings. Details of the work appear in the journal Nature Astronomy.When plumes of water spray out of Europa, the molecules are immediately battered by highly energetic particles, a process that smashes them into charged ions. It is these ions that produce rapid swings in the magnetic field direction and ramp up the density of plasma above the geyser.“Our detection of a plume based on the Galileo data certainly strengthens the case for future exploration of Europa,” Jia said. One Nasa mission, Europa Clipper, is scheduled to launch in the 2020s with the express aim of finding out whether the Jovian moon could harbour life. Another mission, Esa’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or Juice, is expected to launch around the same time and perform flybys of Europa and two other Jovian moons, Ganymede and Callisto.“Given the evidence of plumes available so far, there is a good chance that those spacecraft may obtain direct measurements of plumes ejecting material from the subsurface ocean into space,” said Jia. “Those observations will provide crucial information for us to assess Europa’s potential for life.”As much as scientists may wish it to be otherwise, the Jovian moon is hardly a balmy haven. The surface temperature never rises above -160C (-256F). What warmth there is comes largely from tidal kneading driven by the massive gravitational forces that come with an orbit around Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system. If life has gained what passes for a foothold on Europa, it may be huddled around hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean in a world of frigid, perpetual night.William Sparks, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and leader of the team that found evidence for water plumes on Europa with Hubble, said it was good to have independent confirmation of the watery blasts.“Europa is a moon of Jupiter that is about the same size as our moon, but it’s got more ocean on it than planet Earth,” Sparks said. “It is completely engulfed by this saline ocean which lies beneath a crust of ice, and in terms of a places to host extant life, I think it’s the best location that we’ve got beyond planet Earth. It would be good to find out what is really there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2f310a78d1f029a668ce9fcb6a33aa835e61c24/0_169_4757_2854/master/4757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f1e98ba2fb8da69699adf7aa8f771b","title":"exercise is good for you unless its part of your job","story":"Scientists find physically demanding jobs are linked to greater risk of early deathMen who work as labourers or in other physically demanding roles have a greater risk of dying early than those with more sedentary jobs, researchers say.The finding, from scientists in the Netherlands, reveals an apparent “physical activity paradox” where exercise can be harmful at work but beneficial to health when performed in leisure time.Pieter Coenen, a public health researcher at VU University medical centre in Amsterdam, said the reason for the disparity is unclear, but he believes it may reflect the different types of exercise people get at work compared with those in their free time.Other researchers say the finding may simply reflect a greater likelihood for people in manual labouring jobs to have unhealthier lifestyles in which diet, smoking and alcohol consumption all conspire to reduce life expectancy.But Coenen believes other factors are at play. “If you go out for a run for half an hour in your leisure time,” he said, “that increases your heart rate and you feel well afterwards, but when you are physically active at work, it’s a very different type of activity. You are working for eight hours a day and have limited rest periods. You are lifting, doing repetitive movements, and manual handling.“Our hypothesis is that these kinds of activities actually strain your cardiovascular system rather than help you to improve the fitness of your cardiovascular system.”International public health guidelines encourage people to spend half an hour a day on moderate to intense physical activity to keep healthy, but previous research has shown that those who work in construction and other physically demanding jobs are the least likely to exercise in their leisure time. “They are in double trouble,” said Coenen. “They don’t benefit from the good aspects of leisure-time activity, and they are exposed to the risk of occupational physical activity.”To investigate the effects of exercise on health, the scientists combined the results from 17 published studies, giving them data on nearly 200,000 people. Most of the studies they included took lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake, into account, but Coenen concedes that not all of the studies completely ruled out their harmful effects.In light of the findings, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, Coenen believes more should be done to encourage people in manual work to follow the standard guidelines on exercise, and not be fooled into thinking that they got enough at work. “Even if you are physically active at work, that doesn’t mean you don’t have to be physically active in your leisure time,” he said.Mark Hamer, who studies exercise as medicine at Loughborough University, believes the findings can be explained by manual and office workers having very different lifestyles. He points to a study last year of half a million people in China that found physical activity had health benefits whether it was at work or in leisure time.“The message I would give is that people should try to follow the physical activity guidelines regardless of what they do for a job,” Hamer said. “And people should be thinking about their lifestyles more generally, because that is likely to be at the root of this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88a389542af3af1243bd3fcae155107b16df7be2/0_204_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64db4b849ddf1f9298135a6b538cdef8","title":"invest sure start tribute tessa jowell government urged labour","story":"Labour calls for increased commitment to early years scheme late MP helped set upMinisters have come under pressure to increase their commitment to Sure Start early years centres as a tribute to their political architect, Tessa Jowell, who died of brain cancer at the weekend.Labour MPs lined up to urge the government to invest in the flagship programme, which was established by the Labour government in 1998 to help give disadvantaged children the best possible start in life. The former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell urged Damian Hinds, the education secretary, to “look again” at the scheme, which has transformed hundreds of thousands of lives across the country.More than 3,000 centres were opened during Labour’s years in power, but hundreds were closed after the coalition government came to power in 2010, a move that Jowell described as heartbreaking. The Labour MP Lisa Nandy, who was Jowell’s parliamentary aide during her time as shadow Olympics minister, told the : “Sure Start was one of Tessa’s greatest achievements. She knew how important family life was to her and how important strong families in particular are to disadvantaged children.“She was desperate when the programme was scaled back to such a great extent across the country. She had hoped there had been a cross-party consensus behind it that would protect it. “In the last few days the number of people who have spoken up to talk about what it means to them is one of the things she would’ve been proudest of, and demonstrates why Sure Start matters so much and ought to be reinstated.”Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, hailed Jowell’s role in setting up the programme. She told MPs: “When I was a young mum, it was the Sure Start centre that really helped me and my son. And for all that’s said and done in this chamber, that is the best that any honourable member can hope to have achieved.”Yvette Cooper described Jowell, a former cabinet minister, as the “mother of Sure Start”. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “The greatest tribute the government could pay to her would be to begin again the proper funding of her most important achievement: Sure Start.”Hinds told MPs he shared the view on “the fundamental importance of the early years” but declined to make any promises, speaking instead about the importance of home life and nursery care, as well as early years centres, in boosting life chances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/832b60639b46e651c858fb49fdf25c52fbb35555/363_314_1036_621/master/1036.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f132b1c91e31e429e99fd43f2a0fb0ce","title":"colin graves hundred definite starter","story":"• Only the 10-ball over is up for debate• Not what we were told last week, retorts PCAColin Graves, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, has insisted its new 100-ball tournament will definitely go ahead in 2020 and is needed because the younger generation is “just not attracted” to the sport in its current guises.The ECB had appeared to be softening on the introduction of a fourth format during its conversations with the Professional Cricketers’ Association last week, telling the union it was “not set in stone” and just a “concept” following player concerns over the new eight-team competition’s move away from Twenty20.But Graves, speaking on Monday to the BBC, has hardened the governing body’s position on The Hundred – only the 10-ball over remains up for debate – and reiterated the assertion that the two-and-a-half-hour length for matches has not been dictated by the broadcasters. Asked if the 100-ball tournament was set in stone, despite a largely negative public response, Graves replied: “Yes, as far as we and the ECB board is concerned.”It was Graves who two years ago described the existing T20 Blast played by the 18 first-class counties as “mediocre” compared to the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League. In his latest offering the 70-year-old offered a similar verdict when he outlined why a new tournament is needed. “It is not attracting the audiences, if it was we would not have that issue,” Graves said.“The younger generation, whether you like it our not, are just not attracted to cricket. In all the work, surveys and research we have done, the younger generation want something different. They want more excitement, they want it shorter and simpler to understand. Those are the things we have learnt for this new competition and that is what we have to make it.”This came on the same day the ECB announced 50,000 children aged five to eight years old had signed up to its All Stars Cricket coaching programme – up 13,000 on the first year – while it should also be noted that in the T20 Blast last summer 900,000 tickets were sold, nearly treble the number of six years earlier.As well addressing The Hundred, Graves was asked about the controversial allocation of compensation payments to Test counties in years they miss out on staging a match, including the £2.5m given to Glamorgan for not applying to be a Test host during the major match allocation from 2020-24.This money has already appeared in the Welsh club’s accounts for 2017 but its allocation is now set to be reviewed by the Good Governance Institute at the request of the ECB. It was also queried by two senior directors, Andy Nash and Richardson Thompson, when they resigned from their positions before the board’s reorganisation this month.Graves said: “No payments have been made to counties at all, full stop. I floated an idea talking to four or five county chairmen, that would need to be agreed by the board to go any further. No payments have been made. No payments have been promised. End of conversation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ece543b4153c89033bf6829b7f34a3f7e3722132/0_172_5901_3540/master/5901.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4c0eed702f6c8d0fb74731921288f09","title":"fiji olympic final sevens rugby union coach ben ryan gold medal coach","story":"Fiji’s gold-winning sevens coach at Rio 2016 reflects on the band of brothers he forged into a cohesive team and his troubles with the RFU“I much preferred Fiji – even with a dictator in charge, a boss who was convicted for manslaughter, my phone being bugged, the bankruptcy and black magic – than my last year at the RFU,” says Ben Ryan, as he sips on a double espresso and reminisces about an extraordinary journey that culminated in him guiding Fiji’s sevens side to Olympic gold in Rio.We are in a cafe not far from Twickenham, where Ryan worked for six years as the England sevens coach before falling foul of what he calls the Rugby Football Union’s “machiavellian” struggles for power and influence, “with people above you who can only be trusted never to be trustworthy”.Ryan applied to become Fiji coach after a friend texted him to say he had seen it advertised on Twitter. One 3am interview by Skype later he was offered the job – and on a whim he accepted. “It was scary and risky,” he admits. “But it’s the best decision I’ve ever made.”Initially he wondered whether he had made the biggest mistake of his life. It did not help that when he took his first training session there was no kit or water and only a couple of balls to practise with – or that he was not paid for six months.There were other challenges, too. At his first tournament he passed a player who had built a tower of 10 pains au chocolat each with a fried egg on top for breakfast – a meal the player considered healthy because he was getting plenty of protein. And just before the 2016 Olympics one of his players, Pio Tuwai, was convulsing in his room saying he had been possessed by a witchdoctor. “His eyes were rolling – it was very bizarre,” Ryan says.Many players were also very poor. Jerry Tuwai lived with his family in a one-room shack with corrugated-iron walls, no running water, gas or electricity, but was moulded by Ryan into one of the heartbeats of the team.But whatever clouds he faced always evaporated on the pitch. “It was absolutely joyful,” he says, beaming at the memories. “We weren’t chucking GPS units on. I wasn’t getting my boss telling me they’re only allowed 10 minutes’ contact a week. It was the purest form of rugby and I loved it.”Yet Ryan says the culture of the squad was just as important to Fiji’s success. Of all the stories he tells, one stands out: in 2015 the squad were on a plane when two passengers collapsed with suspected heart attacks. While the stewards revived them, his team got to their feet and took over the job of serving lunch and drinks to the rest of the plane. “They went down the aisles, handing out napkins and asking passengers whether they wanted chicken or fish,” Ryan says. “It wasn’t a stunt and they weren’t prompted. It was just a natural thing to do for them – to be nice. But that’s what we had as a group. Of course we worked hard. But none of the senior management team ever shouted at the players. And we had fun.”Never was that more evident than in August 2016 when Fiji’s 43-7 destruction of Great Britain in the final  earned the country the first Olympic medal in its history. After what he had seen from his players in the tunnel, Ryan knew his team were going to win.“I can think of dozens of occasions where I’ve been more nervous than that Olympic final,” he says. “Honestly, hand on heart, there wasn’t any of that feeling – we were so relaxed beforehand I knew we were going to win.“My captain, Osea Kolinisau, once said to me: ‘If you’re ever in a tunnel and you’re opposite a Fijian that’s smiling, you’d really better watch out.’ It’s their perfect state, they’re relaxed but ruthless. They are the loveliest people off the field but they can switch to being ultimately very ruthless on the field.”But life was not always perfect. Ryan moved to Fiji having not done due diligence and only later discovered the Fijileaks website, with its tales of corruption, bribery and prisons stacked with political opponents.He is unusually guarded when it comes to talking about Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, who seized power in a military coup in 2006, had a keen interest in rugby – as well as his brother-in-law Francis Kean, the president of the Fiji Rugby Union who served time in jail for kicking a man to death. He soon understood not to make eye contact with Bainimarama in meetings and let him dominate the grip when the pair shook hands.“But at least you knew where you stood with him,” Ryan says. That was not the case with the RFU which, he claims, failed to support fully his vision for the England sevens team. “My last tournament with England was the Sevens World Cup in Moscow in 2013,” he says. “We got to the final but I felt no joy. I was completely flat.”Would he go ever back to Twickenham? “It’s something I’ve thought about a lot,” he says. “Not on the performance side but I would seriously consider a role that involved getting more state school kids to play rugby.”For now Ryan is happy doing consultancy work with French Rugby, World Rugby and UK Sport. And while he will not comment directly on speculation he is on a shortlist for the head coach role at Harlequins, he does admit part of him would love to apply his philosophy to the 15-man game.“I would like to prove that with 15s you can succeed by playing a style of rugby that empowers the players, isn’t overly attritional and where everyone in the squad is treated with kindness and respect,” he says.Meanwhile, despite Fiji’s gold medal, he wonders how much has really changed. “The Fijian boys are paid only about £4,000-£6,000 a year,” he says. “Sadly they don’t want to pay the boys the same money as a government minister, say, because they feel there’s so many people waiting to take a player’s place. They can be thrown away and discarded.“It’s very sad,” he adds, the pain evident, “but there’s no legacy in Fiji. Only another day and another struggle.”• Sevens Heaven, The Beautiful Chaos of Fiji’s Olympic Dream by Ben Ryan, is published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson on 31 May, priced £20"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f2b5fc1bed0fa7d9f6a450fe5b29381b46b9e5d/0_438_5152_3090/master/5152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b87c328468055216e94db26202eac541","title":"johanna konta knocks out rybarikova again italian open","story":"Optimism laughs at the scoreboard at all levels of sport and, in different circumstances, Serena Williams and Johanna Konta took the concept to its outer edges on Monday, two weeks before the French Open.Williams, who is 36 and has played a handful of matches since winning the 2017 Australian Open when seven weeks pregnant, is a contender at Roland Garros, according to her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.“Serena will play the French Open to win it,” he told the WTA’s website of her bid to lift a 24th grand slam title, despite pulling out of Madrid last week then Rome to build on her fitness at his academy in Nice. “Can she do it? Serena can achieve anything. After being her coach for six years I’m even more sure of that statement.”Konta’s forecast may not be so grand. She has yet to win a grand slam title and has not got out of the first round in Paris in three visits, losing last year to Hsieh Su-wei, a doubles specialist ranked 109 in the world at the time. However, she said: “I still maintain I have never not liked clay and I am really enjoying playing on the surface this year.”The evidence is not overwhelming. She lost to the world No\u0026nbsp219 Fanny Stollar on the clay of Charleston last month, then the American qualifier Bernarda Pera (97) in Madrid. So the former top-tenner felt entitled to take heart from a tough but welcome victory over Magdalena Rybarikova at the Italian Open – her fourth on the spin in their rivalry.Konta also got the better of the Slovak in Madrid before losing to Pera and, despite hitting 40 unforced errors in one hour and 50 minutes to win 6-4, 6-3, she was smilingly upbeat.Having slipped out of the top 10 to 22 in the world, Konta undergoes further examination of her cheery resolve in the second round, when she plays either lucky loser Aryna Sabalenka or Hsieh.It is not a prospect that bothers her. “I seem to play the same people, so I wouldn’t be surprised if I play her,” she said, laughing.Rybarikova, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon last year, was bumped up in the seedings here when Petra Kvitova, Konta’s scheduled opponent, withdrew at the last minute, exhausted, after winning the Spanish title on Sunday.Four places ahead of Konta in the world rankings, Rybarikova stretched the first set to nearly an hour when Konta might have wrapped it up in half that time if overcooked backhands had not let her down in key moments. Nevertheless she maintained: “I felt good on both sides.”In the peerless setting of Court Pietrangeli, Konta had five chances to break in the first set before crunching out nine points in a row on her opponent’s serve, then slowly found more rhythm in the second set.In all Rybarikova rescued her serve 11 of 16 times. On Konta’s second match point, a call went against her serve and, replaying the point, she looked relieved to force a closing mistake from her opponent.In Konta’s view there are way more positives than negatives. “I am moving well on the surface, I am a little clearer on how I want to play and also on how to keep my game as it is, because it is effective on the clay as it is on the grass and the hard. I am doing a better job this season to not really change something that doesn’t need to be changed.”She may prove to be right. There was at least evidence to suggest that, when her groundstrokes are flowing and she hits flat and hard to the corners, not many players can live with her. Her challenge this week and in Paris is to string enough of the good stuff together to go deep in the draw.Then, as she dissected her performance, she sniffled and said: “I’ve got a bit of a cold but all good. Wecrack on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec478005efff6ec152e883cb6f92bb40ac17b9c/14_187_4673_2803/master/4673.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a126b385f4ba8738be165e41d123f7f4","title":"tiger woods fairytale golf","story":"Woods has performed brilliantly simply to be competitive again but his shortcomings are obviousThere is a recurring danger of sporting dreams blurring reality. The hype around Tiger Woods was once justified but the reality of recent months applies context often missing in the giddy analysis. Woods has performed brilliantly simply to be competitive again after physical trouble so acute he struggled to sit down for dinner. But there, for now, the story ends.Woods’ latest outing at the Players Championship had him finish seven –almost two shots per round – adrift of the winner Webb Simpson. The 42-year-old tied 55th the previous weekend in Charlotte, 32nd at the Masters and trailed the victorious Rory McIlroy by eight at the conclusion of the Arnold Palmer Invitational.Woods’ share of second at the Valspar Championship in early March was impressive but the fact Paul Casey could swat him aside on the Sunday means we are in danger of being seduced by a fairytale.And still, excitement flows. “It is incredibly close,” the former world No 1 David Duval said. “We’ve all questioned what is the top for him in this comeback. What can his body do? What can his new golf game do?”The Golf Channel analyst added: “Having had the opportunity to speak to him about it, we were all in a hurry to judge what was going on. I sat up here and said: ‘Let’s give him the starts, let’s give him the summer, let’s give him the year, let’s see if he can gain some of the freedom he needs.’“Well, it looked to me this week that he regained that freedom. I watched the body pass the club through the downswing, watched him maintain his spine angle through that process. He hit some monster tee shots, incredible iron shots and the freedom with which he did that we just hadn’t seen.“I still want to give him more events but what I saw this weekend makes me excited it could be incredibly close and that must make him excited. I hope he plays sooner rather than later. I hope he doesn’t go home and just hit golf balls. I want to see him play rounds under tournament conditions and expose himself exactly like he did this weekend. Because he did that and he performed.”To an extent, that is. From the position of making the Sawgrass cut by a stroke, Woods raced to eight under par after 12 third‑round holes. He was firmly in the tournament mix. From there he played a gettable closing stretch in plus one. In the final round another fast start – he was six under on the 13th tee – was offset by the playing of holes 14 to 18 in three over. It seems reasonable to infer that, when Woods tries to press for victory – and he has to, having not been the man to catch at any event on this comeback – shortcomings appear. The same happened at the Arnold Palmer, where Woods pulled a tee shot into a back garden, three holes from home.“He’ll win sometime soon enough,” said Jordan Spieth, who partnered Woods on Sunday. “He’s certainly playing well enough to do so. His game, if I compare it to other guys I’m playing with day to day who are winning tournaments, is right up there.”Woods begins this week having leapt to 80th in the world rankings, with a new name on top. Justin Thomas’s out-performing of Dustin Johnson at the Players means the US PGA champion is the world No 1 for the first time.“It’s not something where I just want to do it once,” Thomas said. “I want to do it for a really long time. I want to have it for a really long time because that means I’m playing better than everybody else for an extended period.”"},{"url":null,"title":"funny cow maxine peake rhona cameron rachel fairburn shappi khorsandi","story":"Rhona Cameron, Rachel Fairburn and Shappi Khorsandi give their verdict on the film in which Peake plays an aspiring comic in a man’s worldFor a long time I felt – like Maxine Peake’s character – that life was easier on stage than off. Funny Cow left me pissed off because I wanted to write that film! But I was moved, too, because so much of its emotional core resonated with me. I couldn’t leave my seat for a while because I was so upset. I felt relieved that someone was finally talking about the seriousness of comedy, through the journey of a working-class female standup.I don’t identify as a “woman comic” or indeed a “woman”. I am Rhona. I’ve always been very non-binary gender in my thinking, feeling and actions. But I did notice, as a younger comic, that an unknown male could go on stage and he’d be given a chance. He was allowed to take his time, to indulge, even. But if you were a woman, you had to be “bang, bang, bang, bang” right away, no breaths. So I thought the scene in the club where she demolishes a fat, drunken, thick guy was very powerful.There’s one line that will stay with me: “It’s fuck all to do with being funny, it’s to do with surviving.” That is so true. A comedian is part-gladiator, part-psychologist, part-preacher, part-actor, part-self-harmer, part-poet, part-clown. If you’re screwed up from life and go out on to this risky tightrope of adulation or hatred – running this extreme gauntlet every night – and then go back to this desolation of self, it takes its toll. That’s what makes comedy the mothership of the arts. It’s so fucking dangerous.It’s every northern cliche rolled into one. The performances are brilliant, but I felt that a lot of the film was stereotypical. You have a female character from the north of England, and it’s like: “Of course she’s northern, she’s beaten by her husband. Of course she’s northern, her dad was an alcoholic.” I’ve never written a film, and I hate slating other people’s work, but I just found it a bit empty.You don’t really see any of the reasons why Peake’s character would want to become a standup. She makes two funny comments as a child – using humour as a defence – but doesn’t come across as particularly witty. I suppose, as a kid, she was an outsider and a bit of a showoff. That was relatable: when I was a kid, I was either showing off or I was really quiet, and I always had a side of me that wanted to perform. But it wasn’t clear why she would have wanted to be a standup, other than suddenly going to a comedy night and enjoying one person’s set. I get fed up of the idea that people do standup because they’ve had a hard time when they were young or that they must be sad really, which the film suggests. It’s not true. There are lots of different reasons why people start performing comedy. This could have been an opportunity to have a female standup character who wrote her own material and was different, and that’s why she is funny. But she just goes on stage and does the exact same jokes that a bloke had done. The older comic, Lenny (played by Alun Armstrong), says to her: “It’s not a job for women women aren’t funny.” She sort of proves his point by then doing his jokes.In one scene, Peake goes on stage and can’t speak, and the audience starts heckling. I’ve never frozen like that, but what made it powerful to watch, as a comic, was knowing how badly she wants it, and then seeing her sabotaged by her own nerves. It’s the personification of every bad gig, every bad feeling that you have when you die on stage. They got that bit beautifully, and that made me feel so proud of all that I’ve been through as a professional comic. I thought: “Yes, babe – being a female comic, I get that.”But Funny Cow is not a film about standup comedy. It’s not a film about a woman making her way in the comedy world. It’s a film about child abuse. In the first few minutes, a child gets brutally, viciously attacked with a chain belt. It wrecked my head, to the point where I got into a fight with a man in the audience who was being rude to some women. It’s not a subtle film about the delicate soul of a standup it’s about a spirited child being broken by her parents. She could have decided that, in order to get out of her head, she wanted to be a cartoonist or a landscape gardener. It doesn’t get into the nitty-gritty of being a comedian. I didn’t find anything nuanced about it. There’s a scene where Paddy Considine’s character, a bookshop owner, takes her out to dinner. They do this whole Educating Rita thing, and he says to her: “Who took away your self-esteem?” It’s like: “I see, what happens is comedians don’t have self-esteem – got it!” It didn’t leave much to the imagination.But what made the film, for me, were the spectacular performances. Kevin Eldon’s brilliant turn, John Bishop’s gorgeous cameo. And I could not take my eyes off Peake. She’s an utter superstar, and I now want to see everything she does."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f64871cf074cbe16b5c67aec7ebd86983c5b01/0_579_1887_1131/master/1887.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2168738c1f84ed8f1f581d08e3ce433b","title":"jetpacks jet propulsion flying to work","story":"It’s not as if the tech hasn’t shown promise, but jet propulsion has never become part of our daily lives. Here’s whyThose of a certain age may remember the opening ceremony of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. As Rafer Johnson lit the eternal flame, a man strapped into a rocket-propelled backpack launched himself across the arena above the ticker tape and balloons, landing gracefully on the track before a TV audience of 2.5 billion.It was a moment of triumph seeming to herald a new age in which, finally, teased for decades by Buck Rogers’ “degravity belt” and King of the Rocketmen, we’d all soon be fizzing off to work with our own personal jetpacks. Even Isaac Asimov confidently predicted that by the turn of the century, they would be “as common as a bicycle”.So what happened? In 2018, shouldn’t we all be flying to work? So called “rocketmen” were not entirely the work of fiction. Russian pilot Aleksandr Andreyev had been working on one as early as 1919. Germany’s second world war rocket whiz Wernher Von Braunallegedly worked on a “jet vest” for the US army after the war, which later became project Grasshopper, aimingto build a “jump belt”.All these attempts fizzled out due to lack of funds. It wasn’t until engineer Wendell Moore’s Bell Rocket Belt was first tested in 1960 that the world witnessed a working jetpack – using a turbo jet rather than a rocket. The US military commissioned Moore and John K Hulbert – a gas turbine specialist – to work on the Jet Belt, or “man rocket”, for possible military use. Moore’s first problem was fuel – anything capable of producing enough thrust burned up in a flash. Moore hit upon using hydrogen peroxide, a compound commonly used as bleach, as a fuel. Two cylinders were attached to a fibreglass frame with another of nitrogen gas. Forced on to a catalyst, this mix explodes into superheated steam, shooting through twin nozzles at 700C.Thrust sorted, they soon encountered the human body’s natural resistance to aerial navigation. The device, which used directional thrusters controlled by hand-operated levers, was extremely tricky to stabilise.Undaunted, Moore flew the first flights himself, but in February 1961 the belt swerved like an unattended firehose, snapped its tether and Moore fell 2.5 metres, breaking his kneecap. After 36 tethered flights in a hangar, the untethered belt, was finally flown outside by Harold “Hal” Graham, a 27-year-old Bell test engineer with no previous flight experience. Amid a cacophony of steam, Graham flew for just 13 seconds, covering over 34 metres (112 feet) at an altitude of 18 inches. During the first public display at Fort Eustis, Virginia, on 8 June 1961, Graham lifted himself to around 4.5 metres, dangled around for 15 seconds and landed, offering a salute.It was a big hit with the public. Graham piloted the device all around the world to great acclaim, but after landing on his head from 6.7 metres at a demo in Florida, he retired. Graham handed over the reins to his friend Bill Suitor, who proved adept at flying the machine. Again, the public loved it, but the US army, who was paying for it, was disappointed. The belt weighed 56.7kg with fuel and consumed 19 litres of expensive hydrogen peroxide during its 30 second flight and required a platoon of service personnel to attend to it. It flew neither high nor low enough to be at a safe height, and it was difficult to fly. In the opinion of the military, the Bell Rocket Belt was more a spectacular toy than an effective means of transport, so it withdrew funding.But by then the idea had caught on. Jetpack enthusiast and engineer Nelson Tyler, approached Suitor with his own belt. Suitor flew the Tyler belt to much acclaim at exhibitions across the US, culminating in the triumph flight at the Olympics in 1984. Stunt pilot Kinnie Gibson was next to fly Tyler’s belt, making himself a millionaire flying as the Rocketman until his passing – from natural causes – in 2015. But it was Gibson’s success that is partly why you haven’t come to work on a rocket pack this morning. Then, in 1992, came the RB2000, a project based on the Bell model, built by Brad Barker, Larry Stanley and Joe Wright. If ever there was a moral reason not to build a rocket belt, this story told in The Rocketbelt Caper by Paul Brown – involving lump hammers, lawsuits, drug smuggling and murder – is it.Fast-forward to the 2010s and jetpacks have become a reality again, if not quite in the form of the personal backpack we thought we would all be dangling from. Water-propelled HydroliftJetlev devices have become a commonplace exotic seaside pursuit, while jetpack enthusiasts build untethered versions for themselves, usually similar to the designs of Wendell Moore at Bell. The big difficulty here is still the scarcity of hydrogen peroxide. Inventor, tech whiz and head of Google’s research laboratory Google X, Astro Teller, says even Google has looked into jetpacks, but at a quarter-mile a gallon and with a motor as loud as a Harley Davidson, decided they weren’t practical.More hopeful is the offering from Jetpack Aviation, who specialise in personal vertical takeoff and landing devices. It demoed its JB10 in Monaco (two minutes aloft) and in London in October (four minutes aloft) last year to some acclaim. The brain power behind it? One Nelson Tyler, who aims to release an electric version in 2019 … yours for £200k.Then there’s Swiss ex-military and commercial pilot Yves “JetMan” Rossy, who straps two 8ft carbon wings and four small kerosene jet engines to his body. Online footage shows Rossy confidently executing loop-the-loops and roaring over the Grand Canyon strapped into his device. Drawback: one must throw oneself out of a plane, which makes for a rather awkward commute. Cost: £190k.Richard Browning, meanwhile, is a British inventor dubbed “Wiltshire’s Iron Man”, whose Daedalus personal flightsuit sees him strap jet engines to his back and hands.Perhaps the most promising development, which is already on the market, is that made by Tecnologia Aeroespacial Mexicana. It’s already sold four of its Tecaeromex Rocket Belts, and a helicopter version is in the works. You can even train to use one using a JetLev. We might soon be able to fly about strapped into jetpacks, but whether we should is another matter. It’s hard to disagree with original rocketman Suitor, who said, after his experiences with Barker and co: “I hope they never become popular. Nobody would be safe.“You’d have people falling out of the air like unwanted Santa Clauses. I’ve had several close shaves myself and almost sliced myself up like a big soft slice of silky cheese. Could you imagine every idiot who could afford one flying about?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9ddb84451d5ac7db8483d666c8baaa82a5aa8b2/0_583_4132_2479/master/4132.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdab52381277ef1a04895aa24c210a11","title":"5 best scenic bike rides in west country dorset devon cornwall","story":"These cycle routes, taking in Dorset, Devon and Cornwall, come from a new book, Lost Lanes West, which reveals some of England’s less-well-known, but no-less-exciting, bywaysDorsetType of ride Cliffs, coast roads, wild swims and a lost villageStartfinish WarehamDistance 45 milesDifficulty Challenging.

It’s a geologist’s paradise, featuring sandy heath, ball clay, chalk downland, oil-bearing shale and hard limestones long prized as building materials. Much of London was rebuilt after the Great Fire with stone from Purbeck quarries. The rich geological layer cake provides a variety of wildlife habitats and the Purbeck hills are home to many species of wild flower.Note that this ride passes through the army’s Lulworth firing range. Whiteways Road (between East Lulworth and Steeple) is open almost all weekends, and all the time during the summer but check ahead on the Ministry of Defence’s website to ensure the road is open.Starting out of the fortified Saxon town of Wareham the route heads east through the heath and coniferous woodland above the largest onshore oil field in Europe. Turning west just outside Swanage, the ride passes the craggy ruins of Corfe Castle en route for the “lost village” of Tyneham: in 1943 the war office evicted its 225 residents and the village is now an open-air museum. It’s then a thrilling descent to Lulworth Cove (and a testing climb back up the same road) before heading inland on quiet lanes via Chaldon Herring to the River Frome at Moreton (there are paddling and swim spots by the ford). The church is worth a look for its engraved windows by Laurence Whistler. TE Lawrence “of Arabia”, who lived nearby, is buried in the graveyard here.

Lanes and a couple of short sections of unsurfaced track.Route mapFrome is a groovy, independent-minded Somerset town blessed with many handsome old buildings and some steep, narrow, cobbled streets. There’s a strong cycling scene, too. The hip bike company Charge is based here, as is the Bicycle Academy, which runs courses in framebuilding.This ride takes in two of the great treasure houses of the West Country: Longleat and Stourhead, making use of cycle paths and bridleways that allow people on bikes privileged access to their grounds. Starting out of Frome on National Cycle Route 24, quiet farm lanes lead to Longleat, the 130-room Elizabethan pile set in 10,000 acres, which includes Britain’s first safari park. It’s a real thrill riding from the house up the broad, tree-lined carriage drive to the imposing gateway.Heading south through rolling countryside on the edge of the Wessex chalk downs, the next stop is Stourhead, a Palladian mansion most famous for its gardens, which were inspired by scenes of the Grand Tour of Europe. The ride takes in a short wooded bridleway – that can get muddy after heavy rains – en route to the grandest of Stourhead’s follies: King Alfred’s Tower tops a hill on the border of Wiltshire and Somerset, reputedly the spot where Alfred the Great rallied his troops in defence of Wessex against Viking invaders. More quiet farm lanes lead to Nunney, a bewitchingly pretty village set around a moated castle. From there it’s just three miles back to Frome.Fooddrink• The Seymour Arms in Witham Friary is a fabulous time-warp of an estate pub.

If you’re getting here by train, the flat and mostly traffic-free Stover Trail connects from Newton Abbot station about four miles away. Any bike ride on Dartmoor is going to be hilly but this ride front-loads the climbing, when the legs are freshest. The first five miles are almost entirely uphill all the way to Haytor Rocks, Dartmoor’s most famous landmark.It’s a long and rewarding descent into Widecombe-in-the-Moor, whose church, known as the Cathedral of the Moor, towers above low-slung granite cottages with thatched roofs. From Widecombe, a sliver of tarmac lane climbs gradually up Challacombe Down. Here the desolate wildness of Dartmoor becomes startlingly apparent. Just short of the summit pass short track on the right leads to the remains of Grimspound, a large bronze age walled settlement. It’s an eerie spot and it is fitting that while researching The Hound of the Baskervilles, Arthur Conan Doyle sheltered in one of the huts to a smoke a pipe. The ride then swaps the wide open expanses of the uplands for the complex topography, patchwork fields and dense woodland of the moorland edge, passing through the lovely villages of North Bovey and Lustleigh. The last two miles follows the new Wray Valley cycleway back to Bovey Tracey.Fooddrinkstay• The Rugglestone Inn inWidecombe-in-the-Moor is an authentic, wisteria-clad Dartmoor inn serving real ale and pub grub, and which has a cottage available for short breaks and week-long stays (from £375 a week).• The Ring of Bells Inn in North Bovey is a smart, recently renovated dining pub with rooms (doubles from £95 B\u0026ampB).DevonType of ride Devon lanes by a majestic riverStartfinish TotnesDistance 25 milesDifficulty Moderate. Short but some steep hills. Lanes and a short section of unsurfaced cyclewayRoute mapQueen Victoria praised the River Dart as “England’s Rhine”, which says as much about her own world view as it does about the Dart. The rivers are actually very different. The Rhine is long, wide and meandering and with a vast lowland delta, while the Dart is short, shallow and fast-flowing until Totnes, where it empties into a tidal flooded river valley. What the tidal Dart does share with the Upper Rhine is scenic grandeur, castles and country houses.This short but deceptively hilly ride begins on the traffic-free path from Totnes along the banks of the Dart towards the Sharpham estate. It’s downhill to Bow Creek, one of the fingers of the Dart and a pair of riverside pubs. The Maltsters Arms was once owned and run by Keith Floyd, the TV chef and gastronome. Over the next hill is Dittisham (pronounced Ditsham), a village that sits high on a spur overlooking the Dart and extends downhill to a little quay. Ring the bell for the tiny clinker-built ferry across the water to Greenway (£3.50 for adult plus bicycle). The childhood home of Sir Walter Raleigh, the estate was later bought as a holiday home by Agatha Christie. It’s now in the possession of the National Trust. Some very quiet lanes lead to Stoke Gabriel, another sleepy riverside village, and back via Littlehempston and over the grand stone bridge Staverton for a final run in to Totnes through the grounds of Dartington Hall.Fooddrinkstay• The Maltsters Arms in Tuckenhay is a large foodie pub overlooking the river, which also has double rooms from £79 B\u0026ampB.• The Anchor Stone Café in Dittisham serves local seafood specials on the quayside.CornwallType of ride Classic Cornwall, from tiny harbours to cliff-top minesStartfinish PenzanceDistance 35 milesDifficulty Moderate.

It outdoes the rest of the county when it comes to archetypal Cornish characteristics: its coastline is wilder, its rocks are richer in ores, its fishermen catch more fish and it has more prehistoric ruins.Starting in Penzance, the ride passes the newly restored art deco saltwater lido. Trawlers mass in Newlyn’s harbour and the quayside fish shops sell the day’s catch. Around the headland is Mousehole, where tightly packed terraces rise from its compact harbour and tiny sandy beach. Heading inland, the route passes Carn Euny, one of the best-preserved prehistoric villages in the West Country (free entry). From St Just, an old mining track rounds the headland. It passes the old copper and tin mines whose chimneys and engine houses perch precariously on cliffs above the Atlantic waves. Some of the seams extended deep underground and up to half a mile out to sea.Back on the tarmac at Pendeen, the coast road east towards Zennor is a pure joy to ride, especially when the prevailing westerly tailwind is blowing. It’s a dramatic, elemental landscape: ancient patchwork fields, dark craggy cliffs on the left and shapely hills rising on the right. DH Lawrence rented a cottage near Zennor and loved it here. “This isn’t merely territory,” he wrote in a letter, “it is a new continent of the soul”. The final leg is on quiet lanes to St Michael’s Mount and then the traffic-free promenade path back to Penzance.Fooddrinkstay• Stock up on picnic provisions at Hole Foods Deli and cafe in Mousehole.• The Tinners Arms in Zennor has stone floors, log fires, low ceilings, good beer and simple, local food.

His militant followers, including the Mahdi army, were responsible for attacks on US and British soldiers, fuelled violent sectarianism against Iraq’s Sunni Muslims, and dabbled in protection rackets and kidnapping.To enable this, his movement effectively exploited the network set up by his father, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr, who was assassinated in 1999 during the period of Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship.In person, his rivals have confided to journalists, Moqtada al-Sadr is not regarded as particularly impressive, with the epithet “firebrand” acting as a cover for instability and the shortcomings in his clerical education.Increasingly, however, it is Sadr’s relationship with Tehran that has come to define his political identity. While his Mahdi army was once regarded as being heavily reliant on Iranian-supplied expertise, Sadr has now positioned himself as an opponent of Iranian influence – at least when his rivals such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani are involved.Like his father, who saw Sistani as an “Iranian” interloper, Sadr is an Iraqi Arab nationalist. The family has long seen themselves as representing a rival Iraqi seat of Shia learning and influence to Tehran. This has recently seen Sadr reach out to Saudi Arabia, reportedly to give reassurance that Iraq will not simply be another client of Iran.The latest reinvention of his image is as populist as ever. In 2015, he formed an alliance with the Iraqi Communist party and secular groups under an umbrella of security and corruption concerns, two issues that have long dogged day-to-day Iraqi life, and his constituency.Several parties, including those following Sadr’s leadership, have committed themselves to a vision of a non-sectarian and technocratic government. But the history of Iraq’s past decade and a half – and Sadr’s disruptive role in it – suggests that only time will tell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6c6fdef8a98d5e7b7b9416228d54e2e167bd9c9/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c493d8b73817e09fdf1b79e375fc41","title":"airline pilot sucked halfway out when cockpit windshield broke","story":"Sichuan Airlines co-pilot was pulled back inside by crew after right windshield blew out at 32,000 feetThe co-pilot of a Sichuan Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing on Monday was “sucked halfway out” of the plane when a cockpit windshield blew out, local media reported citing the aircraft’s captain. Captain Liu Chuanjian – hailed as a hero on social media after having to land the Airbus A319 manually – told the Chengdu Economic Daily his aircraft had just reached a cruising altitude of 32,000ft when a deafening sound tore through the cockpit. There was a sudden loss of pressure and drop in temperature. When he looked over, the right windshield was gone. “There was no warning sign. Suddenly the windshield just cracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I know my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window,” he was quoted as saying. “Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most of the equipment malfunctioned ... and I couldn’t hear the radio. The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges.”The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled back in. He sustained scratches and a sprained wrist, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said, adding that one other cabin crew member was injured in the descent. None of the plane’s 119 passengers were hurt. An investigation is under way. The flight, Sichuan Airlines 3U8633, left the central Chinese municipality of Chongqing on Monday morning and was bound for the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. It made its emergency landing in the south-west city of Chengdu. “The crew were serving us breakfast when the aircraft began to shake,” an unnamed passenger told the government-run China News Service. “We didn’t know what was going on and we panicked. Then the oxygen masks dropped … We experienced a few seconds of free fall before it stabilised again. “I’m still nervous. I don’t dare to take an airplane anymore. But I’m also happy I had a narrow escape.” The windshield shattered about half an hour after the plane took off at 6.25am local time, the Chengdu Economic Daily said. A separate report said the aircraft had accumulated 19,912 flight hours since entering service at Sichuan Airlines in July 2011.Birds or lightning strikes have been known to crack airliners’ windshields before but an entire windshield coming off is rare. In 1990 one of the pilots on British Airways flight 5390 was sucked partially out of the cabin window after its windshield blew out at 23,000 feet.

Kim pledged to close the complex after his historic meeting with South Korean president Moon Jae-in, saying North Korea no longer needed the site. There were reports the site had collapsed and was unusable, but Kim himself reportedly dismissed those claims, saying “we have two more tunnels that are bigger than the existing ones and that they are in good condition”.The new images show key buildings and several smaller sheds have been torn down and a rail line connecting one of the entrances had been removed. Excavation of a new tunnel appears to have stopped in March.“This activity along with the rail removal could be further evidence of an operational shut down,” according to 38 North.North Korea’s plan to close the site has been welcomed by Washington, Seoul and the UN secretary general. “I would imagine that the plan is to sanitize the site to remove any sensitive information about the state of North Korea’s nuclear weapons development, then invite in the journalists and experts to confirm that, yes, the site is now a ghost-town,” Jeffrey Lewis and David Schmerler, both arms control experts, wrote in a separate blog post analysis satellite imagery.North Korea’s foreign ministry has said it will invite foreign journalist to witness the decommissioning of the site at Punggye-ri.

It was a poor return for American backing for the Baghdad government’s drive to extirpate Islamic State and regain lost territory.But the bigger loser may be Iran, whose allies in Iraq’s Shia militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces were pushed into second place by Moqtada al-Sadr, the veteran nationalist. Put simply, Sadr believes Iraqis should run Iraqi affairs – not Washington, not Tehran and not their proxies.The pressing question now, for Iraqis and the wider Arab world, is whether the election marks the high watermark of Iranian influence that has grown steadily across the region since the 2003 US invasion. Recent events have blown large holes in the prevailing narrative of an inexorable Iranian advance. In short, have we reached “peak Iran”? Evidence the tide may be turning emerged last week after Donald Trump, in effect, tore up the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sweeping sanctions.Tehran’s fractured leadership seemed caught off-guard by the full force of the US president’s denunciation. It has failed so far to articulate a clear response.Although European signatories will this week tell Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, they are determined to uphold the pact, this seems an empty promise. Faced with swingeing US treasury sanctions, private companies doing business in Iran will mostly walk away. There is little France, Germany or the EU can do to stop them.By its relative silence, the UK – caught as ever between Washington and Europe – is already acknowledging this reality. Nor can Iran rely on Russia or China, also signatories to the deal, to bail it out. To fund its inefficient state-dominated economy, its ongoing interventions in Syria and Yemen and, for example, its ballistic missile programme, Iran needs the billions of dollars accruing from oil exports. This cash flow is in serious jeopardy.Iran had a significant setback in another regional theatre last week, blundering into an Israeli trap. It began with a minor attack last Tuesday on Iranian military facilities at Kisweh, south of Damascus – the latest of several Israeli hit-and-run raids to which Iran had not until then responded. It proved the last straw.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards commanders opened fire on Israeli positions in the occupied Golan Heights. That gave Israel a looked-for pretext to launch a pre-planned assault on Iranian facilities all across Syria. It was a classic sucker punch. Iran’s troublesome military buildup appears to have been halted, at least for now. Iran, meanwhile, risks being outmanoeuvred diplomatically. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, was in Moscow again last week, aligning his interests in Syria with those of Vladimir Putin. Israel forewarned Russia of last week’s attacks.Such coordination is becoming routine. Viewed from Tehran, Russia, ostensibly Iran’s brother-in-arms in Syria, is increasingly unreliable. Its Saudi foes are greatly encouraged by Trump’s offensive.Iran’s regional leadership pretensions are also under challenge on religious and ideological grounds. Just as many Iraqi voters resent Tehran’s domineering, neocolonial behaviour, Shias around the region appear to be looking again to Najaf, the historical capital of Shiadom, rather than to Qom, the Iranian holy city that usurped its role during Saddam Hussein’s Sunni dictatorship. Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most senior Shia cleric in Iraq, is spiritual grist to Sadr’s nonsectarian mill. In rejecting the Velayat-e faqih, the guiding principle established by Iran’s late Ayatollah Khomeini, Sistani has also rejected the fundamental precept that the “trustworthy jurist” (that is to say, Iran’s supreme leader) has absolute power over the body politic as well as the community of the faithful. Sistani’s authoritative drawing of a line (in western terms) between church and state has appeal inside Iran, too, where domestic unrest this year focused on economic woes but also on the overweening, illiberal power of a corrupt theocracy. Iraq’s mini-rebellion against rule by Iranian proxy may yet prove a turning point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/281a24159d436b5406bbbf04f36ffa614412f6fa/332_0_4980_2988/master/4980.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=848be6e3217f22fd93a08f6128f36482","title":"mexico education reform controversy presidential election","story":"Five years after Enrique Peña Nieto’s ambitions programme to reform education, Mexico still ranks last among 35 OECD countriesIt was a flagship policy of Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto: an ambitious reform programme which would revolutionize the country’s education system, improve standards, tame an all-powerful teachers’ union and crack down on rampant corruption – such as wages for non-existent “ghost teachers”.Five years after it was launched, the plan has barely affected standards: Mexico still ranks last in education among the 35 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.And the ministry which is overseeing the reform has now been plunged into controversy after an investigation by the news website Animal Político revealed that that last year, the public education secretariat (SEP) spent more money on communications than on teacher training.“This undermines the credibility of the reform,” said Marco Fernández, a professor in the school of government at Tecnológico de Monterrey.Fernández added that the SEP did not spend what was budgeted last year for teacher development, but has exceeded its communications budget by a factor of 10 between 2013 and 2017.The controversy has once again implicated the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in a scandal at a time when the educational reform has become an electoral issue ahead of 1 July presidential vote. The current frontrunner Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised to kill the reform as he seeks to secure the support of teachers – important election organisers in rural Mexico where schools are often used as poling stations.He added: “The education of Mexico’s children and young people is one of the main fights of this election.”López Obrador has promised to increase public education spending, provide more stipends to students can study and introduce school lunch programs. He also said any future education policy would be made with input from teachers.Politics and education are intimately intertwined in Mexico, where teachers were sent after the revolution to provide a state presence in remote rural areas and counter the influence of the Catholic church.Just before the education reform was introduced in 2013, the powerful boss the teacher’s union Elba Ester Gordillo was arrested on corruption charges, but she was released to house arrest in December – on the day the PRI forged an electoral alliance with a small party previously controlled by Gordillo and her union.

Already, though, he had been forced to abandon her, propelled over the border into Brazil in search of food, work and, perhaps eventually, a fresh start for his family. “It was so difficult, just imagine,” Guerra said of the decision to leave his child.Guerra’s four marching companions, like him penniless, famished and unshaven, nodded grimly in agreement. “There’s no future in Venezuela,” said José Luis Moya, a 24-year-old from the north-eastern state of Anzoátegui who was making the trek with a gaping hole in his right sole. “We’re escaping because we don’t want to die.”Mired in economic, political and social crisis, Venezuela will hold a presidential election on 20 May – a vote the country’s mainstream opposition will boycott and which much of the international community has condemned as rigged.President Nicolás Maduro, who took power after Hugo Chávez’s death in 2013, rejects such criticism and has pledged to use a second term to bring a “new era of rebirth, hope and renewal” to a country critics say he has brought to its knees.Under the late Hugo Chávez, who ushered in Venezuela’s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.\u0026nbspThis concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts. After Chávez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.\u0026nbspIt also means that the government can’t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.\u0026nbspMaduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions – through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.For the 5,000 Venezuelans reported by the UN to be streaming out of the country each day those are fantastical claims. “Let’s be clear: we have no hope,” said Yorquis Rísquez, a 24-year-old mother who fled into Brazil earlier this year and now lives with her family in a dilapidated squat in the city of Boa Vista. “There’s no such thing as hope in Venezuela under this government. Our hope is bringing our kids here.”More than a million Venezuelans have headed west to Colombia since an exodus some call Latin America’s worst-ever migration crisis began in 2015, fueled by a toxic cocktail of economic strife and rampant violence. But a growing number, like Rísquez and her family, are choosing Brazil, which many see as a safer and, so far, less oversubscribed destination.For those unable to pay a bus fare, that means a grueling odyssey on foot down a road Brazil’s press has dubbed the Rota da Fome or Hunger Highway. The Highway starts just over the border from Venezuela, in the town of Pacaraima, and runs south to the regional capital Boa Vista, through the São Marcos indigenous reserve – a tapestry of sun-scorched settlements that are home to the Macuxi, Taurepang and Wapichana peoples. Media reports have highlighted the growing animosity towards migrants as they flock to this sparsely populated borderland, as well as their exploitation by unscrupulous ranchers. Several towns have seen protests in one a shelter was ransacked. Brazil’s far-right presidential frontrunner, Jair Bolsonaro, fanned those flames during a recent visit to Boa Vista, where thousands of Venezuelans are camped out in public squares, abandoned buildings or army-run shelters. “Nobody wants to show them the red card, load them on to trucks and send them back … But we also can’t carry on like this.”Yet the migrants have also found solidarity and kindness along the BR-174. “Today it’s them, but tomorrow it could be us,” said Oton Guimarães, the deputy tuxaua, or chief, of Vila Três Corações, a Macuxi village about 110km, or two days’ walk, south of Pacaraima. Seated in the shade of a tamarind tree, the softly spoken 67-year-old recalled how his community had opened its arms to Venezuela’s tired, poor and huddled masses, on the condition they obeyed local rules: “No fooling around, no disrespect, no alcohol.” “They show up here with their feet covered in blisters, very weak, dehydrated,” the headman said, adding poetically: “It’s an adventure, a destiny with no address.”Guimarães said dozens of passing migrants were offered free board and lodging in exchange for their work. “They’re trustworthy folk … They do a bit of everything and we are thankful,” he said. For a time, Guimarães even opened his own home to a migrant. “He built this toilet for me,” he remembered, pointing to a breeze-block outhouse nearby. Not all of the Highway’s indigenous communities have been so welcoming. In Entroncamento, village chief Maria Joana da Silva said she pitied the migrants. “But there’s nothing we can do … We don’t want them living here. “Lots of prisoners were released over there in Venezuela,” she added suggestively.In Boca da Mata, another roadside hamlet, chief Leoneide Torres said it was her Christian duty to help the families she often saw splayed out beside the road: “They arrive in a seriously precarious state. It’s hunger, real hunger.”But Torres, 53, was nervous too. “Our biggest worry is that in among them there are traffickers, drugs. We know this is happening. Some of them are coming over the hills back there … they have a detour so they don’t have to pass through the checkpoint.”Despite such suspicions, Efraín Godoy, a restaurant worker from the city of Barcelona, on Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, said he had been humbled by the reception he had received from the Macuxi.Godoy, 29, remembered staggering into Vila Três Corações in February, after three days on the Highway, sunburned, covered in insect bites and so dehydrated he was on the verge of vomiting. Locals offered him a hammock in the malocão – a traditional palm-thatched hut at the heart of their village – and, weeks later, he could be found helping cater for a summit of indigenous teachers that his adoptive home was hosting. “It’s all new to me … new and marvelous,” enthused Godoy, who planned to stay until his application for refugee status is approved and he can start looking for work to help the eight-member family he had left behind. Venezuela was marching backwards but Godoy was determined not to do the same, using his exile to learn Brazil’s language, Portuguese, and study its indigenous traditions. “It’s a unique experience that will stay with me forever.”For Guerra’s ragtag expedition such a reception still lay several days off – and their final destination, Boa Vista, further still. After a 15km slog in searing Amazonian heat they paused at Sorocaima, the first indigenous village south of the border.Guerra slumped to the ground outside a butcher’s shop, too exhausted to speak and apparently suffering from heat stroke. His comrades, though, were defiant, vowing to march on through the night. Moya said the Highway’s hardships paled into comparison with the suffering back home. “I feel happy because I’m moving towards a future,” he said as the men prepared to hit the Highway once again. “In Venezuela I felt dead. At least walking I have hope.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495035.1526319487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish bumblebee population in decline","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA bumblebee feeds on nectar: To address declines in pollinating insects, an All-Ireland Pollinator Plan was launched in 2015.  Photograph: Jane Powers Irish bumblebee populations recorded in 2017 were at the lowest since monitoring began six years ago, with marked losses in critical native species, according the latest monitoring figures.The declines are confirmed by the All-Ireland Bumblebee Monitoring Scheme co-ordinated by Dr Tomás Murray, senior ecologist at the National Bioersity Data Centre in Co Waterford.There are 21 species of bumblebee in Ireland, which are vital pollinators of crops and wild plants. The findings released on Tuesday are based on the past six years of monitoring across more than 100 sites focusing on eight of the most common bumblebee species.“Based on a 2006 ‘red list’ , we already knew that six of our rarer 21 bumblebee species are threatened with extinction from this island,” Dr Murray said. Bumblebees are larger than honey bees and do not cluster in hives.“These include the charismatic great yellow bumblebee now confined to the northwest and the shrill carder bee, with its distinctive buzz, now only found in isolated populations in the west of Ireland,” he noted.Of 98 Irish wild bee species, one-third are threatened with extinction, he confirmed. For the first time, these new findings provide an early-warning signal on how more common bumblebees are faring.The large carder bee is threatened across Europe and, despite Ireland having relatively widespread populations of this species, a 23 per cent decline in the numbers have been seen since 2012, Dr Murray said.A combination of habitat loss, intensification of agriculture, hunger due to a decline in wildflowers, disease, poisoning by pesticides, climate change and imported species has caused bee population decline in Ireland.The overall trend since 2012 is a year-on-year decline of 3.7 per cent leading a total loss of 14.2 per cent. “Given the variability around our estimate, we have to be cautious about not crying wolf, but it is telling that we are detecting moderate declines in widespread species after only six years,” Dr Murray said.The declines were discovered partly due to the efforts of 80 citizen scientist volunteers. They walk a fixed route of one or two kilometres once a month from March to October and count the number and type of each bumblebee they observe using a standardised methodology.“In 2017, we collectively walked 883km over 490 hours, and counted 12,969 bumblebees across 14 species, making this one of the first national citizen science schemes in the world that tracks changes in wild pollinator populations,” Dr Murray said.To address declines in pollinating insects, an All-Ireland Pollinator Plan (AIPP) was launched in 2015. Its implementation is co-ordinated by the National Bioersity Data Centre.Project officer Juanita Browne said it was undeniable that bees are declining. “But the good news is we know exactly what we need to do to help bees, and the actions needed are very doable and will show results almost immediately.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Nearly 4,000 women still waiting for callback from CervicalCheck helplineHere\u0026rsquos how to go about choosing the best course and the right college for youDublin commuters told no trains operating between MalahideHowth and KillesterSix-storey Kilternan block would be followed by offices and more housing, developer saysCouncil hopes move will prompt families to use financial supports and rent independentlyBoard restoration and management review to be part of plan to rebuild public confidence\u0026lsquoI know people get pregnant by rape, but there\u0026rsquos a lot of counselling out there for that\u0026rsquoFour career experts offer advice on what to consider when deciding on your courseEmail shows clinical director regretted any \u0026lsquoperceived lack of clarity\u0026rsquo in cancer reviewInterim HSE chief says top management not told of row between doctors and CervicalCheckTimeline for the remainder of the 2018 college application processOf 98 Irish wild bee species, one-third are threatened with extinction, monitors findIt\u0026rsquos time to review your CAO application so here\u0026rsquos how to get your course choice rightPublic perception of teachers in Ireland is quite different to many other countriesA law degree alone will not make you a barrister or solicitor but it does confer an advantageSarah McInerney writes about her journey from being a DCU undergrad unsure about her course choice to an award-winning journalistNot everyone who wants to work in health sciences chooses to become a doctorMore than just a degree: Opportunities abound in many branches of engineering and technology as creativity and critical skills are increasingly in demandHow to know if a science, technology, engineering and maths course is right for you"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495045.1526320212!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plans for one of ireland s biggest mosques get green light","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWarrenstown mosque: an architect’s view of the complex that An Bord Pleanála has approved for BlanchardstownPlans for one of the largest mosques in Ireland have been given the go-ahead by An Bord Pleanála in spite of local opposition.The planning-appeals board has said the Shuhada Foundation of Ireland can build a four-storey mosque, community centre and primary school on the site of Warrenstown House, a former HSE facility in Blanchardstown, in west Dublin.Dr Taufiq al-Sattar, a Dublin-based neurosurgeon, pledged to build the mosque in memory of his late wife, Shehnila Taufiq, who died along with their daughter Zainab (19) and sons Bilal (17) and Jamal (15) in an arson attack in Leicester, England, in September 2013. Its tapering steel minaret, from where Muslims are called to prayer, will be 29m (95ft) high, the equivalent of seven or eight storeys.The board approved the development after finding that it would not seriously harm local amenities or property or cause a traffic hazard.Fingal County Council approved the plan last year, but it was then appealed by Patrick Regan, a former local resident, on the grounds of noise pollution, traffic congestion and lack of public consultation. A number of other locals lodged observations and a petition they expressed concerns about the visual and aural impacts of minarets excessive scale, overdevelopment and unsustainable development lack of integration with the local community and creation of an exclusive community.The council told the appeals board that the minaret will not be visually obtrusive and that any potential noise disturbance will be controlled by planning conditions. It also said the Shuhada Foundation of Ireland has indicated that the school and community centre will be open to everyone.Plans for the development were first lodged in 2016. They were substantially revised and scaled down last year after the council raised concerns about the scale of the development.“The call to pray can often start as early as 5.30am and the last call to pray at 9pm, causing noise pollution, with up to 150 worshipers attending at any one time during normal day prayers, without the celebration of Ramadan and other social events.”The new mosque will be financed from Dr al-Sattar’s family fund, his life savings and donations from the Muslim community in Leicester. He also plans to raise funds from the medical community in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan."},{"url":null,"title":"barnier on brexit ireland has the full support of all european states","story":"  April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator wants significant progress on problem of Irish Border by June   April 30, 2018DUP leader Arlene Foster says Barnier does not understand unionist culture   April 30, 2018EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator says preparations must be made for no agreement on visit to Border area   May 1, 2018EU\u0026rsquos Brexit negotiator presses British for rapid agreement as DUP raises temperature   May 1, 2018Varadkar and Barnier put further pressure on UK to suggest detailed border solutions   May 7, 2018Key allies back delaying talks on EU-UK deal until withdrawal treaty fully agreed "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3495755.1526371424!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the no side needs to make headway now but it s not happening","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Yes campaign: repealers have taken a softly-softly approach to their pitch to the middle ground.

Photograph: Artur WidakAFPGettyIf there is to be a move in the abortion-referendum campaign, then this is moving week.A slew of polls early in the campaign painted more or less the same picture: a substantial lead for the Yes side, and a pretty solid foundation for that support. That lead is not unassailable, and a dramatic late swing to the No side, of the sort we have seen in other referendum campaigns, could change the outcome.If that is to happen it is likely to happen in the next seven days, as undecided and weakly committed voters begin to make up their minds. If the No side is going to turn it around it needs to make some headway, and fast.It is those middle-ground swing voters whom the No side will have to target in the remaining days of the campaign if the current trajectory is to change. There is little sign that it is doing so with any purpose or success, however. Many of its posters and messages have been more directed at its base, the 30 to 35 per cent of voters who do not want constitutional change, rather than at the chunk in the middle who want change but are not sure if they want it to be to the extent the Government has proposed. It is important to get your base out in any election or referendum, but there are simply not enough in the anti-abortion base to win this referendum.All inidual polls are susceptible to error taken together, dozens of them rarely are. And, combined, all the polling of the past 18 months and before tells us that a settled majority of Irish voters is in favour of liberalising the law on abortion the majorities for legal abortion in the “hard cases” of rape, fatal foetal abnormalities, threats to the health of the woman and so on are huge. They will not change. That is a great advantage to the repealers.The retain side can win only if it convinces enough soft repealers and undecided voters that the Government’s proposal to legalise abortion on request up to the 12th week of pregnancy is a step too far. But those soft repealers are not responsive to the uncompromising abortion-is-murder message that has underpinned much No side campaigning. If you are talking about dead babies you are not talking to the middle ground.A major No side pivot that would see it address the middle ground was expected but has not materialised. Not yet, anyway. Facebook and Google’s decision to restrict and cancel referendum advertising disproportionately affected the No side. It has made the pivot harder.It has also angered No campaigners, feeding their sense that the establishment – the Government and the media – is ranged against them. And when you are angry it’s harder to talk to the middle ground.By contrast the Yes side has been better at taking a softly-softly approach to its pitch to the middle. It has talked about the hard cases, about the realities of women’s lives, about lived experience. It is easier for the repealers to talk to the middle ground, because they have more in common with them. But they have also been better at it than their opponents have. The campaign has by and large cultivated a message discipline and focus largely absent from its early stages (and still wholly absent online, although that may not matter).None of this means there can’t be a change in the campaign as it enters its final stage. But it does mean it is hard to see where it would come from. For now, anyway, it’s advantage repeal.

Photograph: Matt CardyGettySo nostalgic and moleskin-trousered by stereotype, Britain’s Eurosceptic right is actually mesmerised by technology. In the referendum campaign, Leavers espoused the power of digital communication to collapse geographic distance, and make India as viable an export market as France.Now, faced with the riddle of how to leave the customs union without compromising supply chains or peace along the Irish Border, they bank on unspecified inventions to finesse the problem over time.This vein of techno-optimism does not run through Brussels, where “maximum facilitation” has few supporters, or even London, where Theresa May, the prime minister, tries to sell colleagues on a simpler customs partnership with the EU. Such is the minutiae behind an intra-Conservative Party war fought in increasingly public view.The mystery is why, with a hardish Brexit so close, Leavers would choose to die in this particular ditch. The customs partnership would not prevent an independent British trade policy. Britain would have to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU, but this seems a small nuisance next to the prize of exit. And if the technology really does emerge, partnership can be swapped for max fac later on.Yet Boris Johnson, whose survival as foreign secretary is a daily reproach to May’s judgment, calls her idea “crazy”. Jacob Rees-Mogg MP goes with “completely cretinous”. Ministers whom she has asked to war-game the policy will do so with clothes pegs on their noses and expressions of distaste.There is something forced, almost thespian, about their complaints. After all, their dream is near. Why imperil it? Leavers did not just win the referendum, but the interpretation of the result, too. Britain is leaving the customs union and the single market, despite the closeness of the vote and the ambiguity of its meaning. We have lived through the gradual normalisation of a type of exit that was held to be “hard” in the days after the referendum.May has been a gift to the Leavers. As a rookie prime minister, hemmed in by advisers who failed to last the course, it was she who drew the red lines that left little to negotiate with the EU. “Trust me,” she wrote in the Sunday Times last weekend, but they should trust her implicitly by now.Why, then, this struggle among Leavers to take yes for an answer? Perhaps it is sincere, and they read into the difference between max fac and customs partnership a significance that is worth delaying an exit deal for. But with various pressures against them – time, the House of Lords’ enthusiasm for the single market – a passionate Leaver would surely compromise at this stage.Which is why we must entertain a more cynical theory. A good number of Leavers do not want to be associated with the exit deal that Britain eventually strikes with the EU, whatever its content. To that end, they are inventing grievances. Disavowal of the agreement allows them to escape blame if economic life deteriorates after its implementation, or voters feel no compensating thrill of self-government. “If only we had left properly,” would serve as the Leavers’ defence against popular anger.The betrayal narrative writes itself. A cabinet resignation or two would help it along. Johnson’s behaviour is consistent with that of a man who wants to be fired. Having won the referendum as rebels, endorsement of the official deal would turn the Leavers into apologists for a new status quo overnight, with all its imperfections and disappointments. Not just MPs, but newspapers too, would have to explain away the non-materialisation of Shangri-La on British soil. Neither temperament nor experience equips them for life as pragmatic defenders of a flawed but liveable reality. They will do what they can to prevent the change in role.And if their vexatious complaints prevent any deal being agreed, then, for some of them at least, so much the better. A certain kind of Leaver has always loathed the idea of exit talks, as though European permission were needed, and hates even more the prospect of entanglement in budget payments, regulatory agencies and the like.If all this seems implausibly calculated, then remember what the alternative explanation is. You have to believe that people who have devoted their adult lives to the cause of EU exit would, on the brink of their dream’s orderly enactment, become immovable on the details of customs regimes that merited no mention before.I do not believe it. Even their language (“crazy”, “cretinous”) suggests the histrionics of a ham actor.

Photograph: AP British prime minister Theresa May has invited all Conservative backbench MPs to private Brexit briefings in Downing Street on Tuesday, as she tried to stop a row over Britain’s future customs relationship with the EU tearing the party apart. Ms May admitted there were flaws in both the customs models being considered by the government, a view reinforced by Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, at a foreign affairs meeting in Brussels. “So he thinks it’s unnecessary to fight about it, as none of them are realistic, no matter which one they choose.”Ms May is being urged by senior Tories to abandon her support for a so-called “customs partnership” with the EU, with hopes rising in Eurosceptic circles that the prime minister will switch her support to their favoured option.Ms May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell gave Tory MPs what one called “a technical briefing” on the advantages and flaws of the two customs options being considered by ministers and which have split the cabinet.The prime minister has abandoned hopes of resolving the issue this week, but is hoping to finally agree a favoured customs proposal next week. “This is complex stuff,” said one aide. “This was a chance to explain the issues and take questions.”Ms May’s preferred option - a “new customs partnership” under which Britain would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU - was rejected by a majority of her inner Brexit cabinet earlier this month. Boris Johnson called it “crazy”.Pro-Brexit ministers, including Mr Johnson, back a “maximum facilitation” plan that would create a customs border between Britain and the EU, including in Ireland, but use technology and “trusted trader” schemes to smooth trade. The political mood appears to be shifting towards the latter option, even though the EU has warned that it would not address its demand that there should be no hard border in Ireland.Damian Green, Ms May’s former deputy and a close ally for many years, suggested on Sunday that a form of “max fac” could emerge as the preferred option, but that Britain might have to stay in a customs union while the technology was developed.British chancellor Philip Hammond is also said by colleagues to be willing to consider that approach, although he remains worried about the impact of any customs border on British companies trading with the EU. Greg Clark, the pro-European business secretary, paid a visit to Svinesund on the Norway-Sweden border on Monday morning to examine how customs arrangements work there.“Greg wanted to see it to get a proper understanding of how an example of ‘max fac’ could work in practice, and it was definitely not without friction,” said one ally.Meanwhile David Miliband, former Labour foreign secretary, returned to the British political fray on Monday to join a cross-party campaign for a soft Brexit.“Britain is being held to ransom by demands for a hard Brexit, severing links with the customs union and single market,” Mr Miliband said.Mr Miliband shared a platform with Nick Clegg, former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, and Nicky Morgan, Tory chair of the Commons Treasury committee, calling for Britain to retain very close ties to the EU. - Financial Times Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

Here\u0027s all the latest news about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (although perhaps not now including her father Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.

The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd.

The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.Wedding at Windsor CastleThe couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, will walk Ms Markle down the aisle, but may not make a formal speech.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridThe royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleThomas Markle, father of the bride, pulls out of royal wedding ceremony after paparazzi rowGAP \u0026#39extremely sorry\u0026#39 for China map T-shirt which omits Taiwan and the South China SeaWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday, the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyThomas Markle, father of the bride, pulls out of royal wedding ceremony after paparazzi rowGAP \u0026#39extremely sorry\u0026#39 for China map T-shirt which omits Taiwan and the South China SeaSoros foundation to close office in Budapest over Hungarian government\u0026#39s \u0026#39repressive\u0026#39 policiesHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest updatesRamadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranKristen Stewart goes barefoot on Cannes red carpet in rebellion against heels-only policyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

Get out of China if you don\u0027t recognise its borders.Another post said: Resist such a rubbish company! And withdraw this T shirt from all markets.Amid the rising tide of anger, GAP issued a statement on Weibo on Monday evening saying that the company respects China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.We have acknowledged that the design of the Chinese map on a T-shirt in some overseas markets is incorrect. We feel extremely sorry for the unintentional mistake, it added.We are now launching an internal investigation to correct mistakes as soon as possible. This product has been withdrawn from China\u0027s market and destroyed.Chinese officials and Internet users are often quick to lambast companies who fail to recognise on their websites or with their products Beijing\u0027s claims in the South China Sea or over the self-ruled island of Taiwan.The prestigious Man Booker International Prize changed the nationality of a Taiwanese nominee to Chinese on its website after it was pressured by officials from China\u0027s Embassy in the UK. The literary prize eventually backtracked on its decision last month.British Airways also changed its website to list Taiwan as a Chinese territory in its dropdown menus, following German airline Lufthansa in giving in to Beijing\u0027s demands.The White House last week harshly criticised China\u0027s efforts to require foreign airlines to change how they refer to Taiwan and the former British colony of Hong Kong, labelling the effort Orwellian nonsense.Meanwhile, a photo of Chinese tourists wearing T-shirts depicting Beijing\u0027s claims to the disputed South China Sea when they arrived at a Vietnamese airport has sparked online anger in Vietnam.The shirts featured a map of China and its \u0027nine-dash line\u0027, which illustrates the sea boundary which Beijing says proves its claim to most of the waterway, despite partial claims from Vietnam and other nations.Photos of the tourists in their nationalist attire were widely shared on Vietnamese social media, with many posts calling for the party to be deported.Additional reporting by Christine WeiPlease review our commenting policyThomas Markle, father of the bride, pulls out of royal wedding ceremony after paparazzi rowWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

However a last-minute setback has called the couple\u0027s plans into confusion, with Ms Markle\u0027s father – who was to walk the bride down the aisle – revealing on Monday he was no longer planning to attend the ceremony.Thomas Markle had been intending to travel from Mexico to the UK to meet Prince Harry for the first time, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Yet after embarrassing disclosures about his dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, he has changed his plans.Yet the wheels for the wedding are still in motion, with the couple promising a wedding focused on fun, joy and a chance to celebrate with the public.The couple, who became engaged in November last year when the Prince got down on one knee as they cooked a roast chicken at his Kensington Palace home, Nottingham Cottage, have been heavily involved in the planning of the celebration.So what\u0027s in store? Here\u0027s all the latest news about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but Harry and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsThe Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince George and Princess Charlotte look almost certain to be page boy and flower girl. The siblings already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Kensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016Friends including Jessica Mulroney, Misha Noo Lindsay Roth, Benita Litt, Janina Gavankar and Priyanka Chopra are expected to be part of the congregation.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Following the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonIt is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.Wedding at Windsor CastleThe couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father Thomas Markle choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Radlan at the Invictus GamesIn February, one of the five original Spice Girls Mel B hinted that the Spice Girls were expected to reunite for the Royal wedding. The singer, known to fans as Scary Spice, claimed she had received a proper invitation during an appearance on a television chat show.Fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham also appeared to let slip she was attending the big day during an appearance on The Late, Late Show with James Corden earlier in April. Asked if she would be among the guests, she said: I, uh, I, I don\u0027t know...However, it has recently been reported that the Spice Girls have no plans to perform at the wedding, and have not been rehearsing for the event.Victoria and her husband David were invited to the 2011 royal wedding. Prince Harry with the Spice Girls in 1997Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday declared. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridThe royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyThomas Markle, father of the bride, pulls out of royal wedding ceremony after paparazzi rowGAP \u0026#39extremely sorry\u0026#39 for China map T-shirt which omits Taiwan and the South China SeaWhat time does the Royal wedding start?

Mr Orban says Mr Soros is out to undermine Europe\u0027s cultural identity while the billionaire has accused him of running a mafia state.Before the election, Mr Orban\u0027s political campaign vilified Mr Soros, and his activity supporting civil society, on billboards nationwide.Open Society said the campaign had invoked anti-Semitic imagery from World War II. The government has repeatedly denied this.The NGO legislation is expected to be one of the first laws passed by the new parliament.It would allow the interior minister to ban any NGOs active in the immigration field deemed to pose a national security risk.

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday, the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.While we don\u0027t know for sure how long the procession will take, a similar procession in 1999 by Edward and Sophie took 15 minutes.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle: The story of the American actress about to join the Royal familyThomas Markle, father of the bride, pulls out of royal wedding ceremony after paparazzi rowGAP \u0026#39extremely sorry\u0026#39 for China map T-shirt which omits Taiwan and the South China SeaSoros foundation to close office in Budapest over Hungarian government\u0026#39s \u0026#39repressive\u0026#39 policiesHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayPrince Harry and Meghan Markle: Royal wedding details and latest updatesRamadan 2018: How Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranKristen Stewart goes barefoot on Cannes red carpet in rebellion against heels-only policyRoyal wedding guest list: Who has been invited to Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding: How to watch on TVWhat time does the royal wedding church service start?

That viability will be undermined unless the threat of climate change is tackled soon, the researchers say.£1 trillion fund manager pressures firms on ersity, climate change“The nature of climate change is such that either physical damage from weather or radical changes in technology and policy will occur in some combination, so action is needed now,” the report says.It challenges the bank’s record on climate change and says its programme of, in effect, printing billions of pounds to prop up the economy has disproportionately helped carbon-intensive companies that are choking the planet.Under quantitative easing (QE), the bank has bought billions of pounds of debt from companies and the government.This is supposed to increase demand for debt, which in turn lowers interest rates. Cheaper borrowing means more borrowing which is supposed to be used to fund economic activity.But the researchers argue that QE has been actively harmful to efforts to combat climate change because the bank’s own criteria have been skewed towards buying debt from high-carbon sectors like manufacturing and utilities.Pentagon erases ‘climate change’ from report drafted during Obama eraAmericans who believe in conspiracies likely to doubt climate changeUK is ‘first developed economy to examine Paris climate commitments’Climate change could trigger volcanic eruptions across the worldIn the energy sector, for example, the BoE has been restricted to buying debt from oil and gas companies’. It has purchased none from renewable energy providers.The report says the BoE should get rid of those linked to fossil fuels face significant risk if the world rapidly shifts to a low-carbon economy.It also argues that the purchase of hundreds of billions of pounds worth of government bonds (debt) via QE has poured cash into the financial system, pumping up prices of assets such as stocks, but has had little impact on the “real economy”.These bond purchases have also not stimulated public borrowing because the government has been committed to austerity and cutting debt.To have a genuinely powerful, positive impact central banks should instead instigate “green QE”, which prioritises buying sustainable investments, the report suggests. This would directly stimulate activity in green sectors which have the potential to grow rapidly, Positive Money argues.It points out that Swiss, Norwegian, and Dutch central banks already look at environmental, social and governance criteria when considering some investments.Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system.

The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Positive Money also calls for the Bank to look into effectively print money for the government to spend directly on green projects.This method, known as “overt monetary financing”, is controversial but has been advocated in a variety of forms by respected figures including Lord Adair Turner, former head of the UK’s financial regulator.Supporters argue that it simply dispenses with the artificial step of the government issuing debt to the markets in the form of bonds which are then bought up by the central bank.This approach is illegal under the Lisbon Treaty, but the UK will not be bound by this once it leaves the EU.Despite the potential hurdles, the report argues that the BoE could already begin to take sustainability into account in its decision-making without any need for the government to overhaul current laws. The primary aspect of the BoE’s mandate is to maintain stable prices but it must also “support the economic policy of Her Majesty’s government”. That policy already includes sustainability as an aim.In addition, the Treasury should reassess the Bank’s remit to require that it considers how climate change affects financial stability, the report says.Author of the report, Positive Money economist Rob Macquarie, said: “The climate crisis and the low-carbon transition presents a fundamental challenge for finance, changing the context for central banking. Central banks underpin and oversee the financial and monetary system and have enormous resources at their disposal, so must do more to support the green transition.“By focusing solely on climate change as a risk to financial stability, the Bank of England runs the risk of leaving meaningful action until it is too late. Climate change also threatens the long-term viability of the economy, which is of concern to the Bank, but cannot be addressed by looking at financial stability alone.“The Bank of England’s mandate must be hardwired for sustainability and climate change.”The report is set to be launched at an event in Parliament this morning, with a panel featuring the chair of the UK’s Committee on Climate Change, Lord Deben, Shadow Minister for International Climate Change, Barry Gardiner MP, and Liberal Democrat Energy and Climate Change Spokesperson, Baroness Featherstone.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The new handset – which packed new internals into the small body of the iPhone 5 – proved immediately popular, and Apple is said to have been surprised by the scale of the interest in the new phone.Now Apple is rumoured to be updating the two-year-old handset. The sheer quantity of the rumours does appear to suggest that something is on the way – though it\u0027s not clear what exactly that might be.Apple finds technique that could revolutionise how iPhones are madeThe company might simply choose to upgrade the internals so that they are faster and more fresh, without making any major changes to the outside. That was suggested by usually reliable analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who said earlier this year that his sources in the supply chain didn\u0027t appear to be expecting a drastic overhaul that would bring new features like wireless charging or the iPhone 8\u0027s glass back.However, some rumours suggest a far more extreme change. Leaks that claim to have come from the Chinese supply chain have suggested that the company could be preparing an update to the iPhone SE that would make it more like an iPhone X – including that phone\u0027s edge-to-edge display and the trademark notch that cuts into it – though those rumours are far from confirmed.Many of the rumours suggest that the new phone could come sooner rather than later, and that it will launch long before the main updates to the iPhone arrive in September.If the phone does receive a significant upgrade, it is unlikely that the company would reveal it without an event at the same time. There will probably be only one event before the major iPhone reveal in the Autumn – Apple\u0027s Worldwide Developers Conference, where it tends not to reveal new hardware.But if only the insides receive an upgrade to make them faster, then it is possible Apple could release the new phone with a simple press release.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Linda* emptied her refrigerator, packed some clothes, her toothbrush, toothpaste and an iron, and left the house she had lived in for 34 years – for good.“I closed the door, turned my back, started my car and left,” she says. “I had lived there since February 1977. A lot of things, carrying a lot of memories, remained behind that closed door.” The hardest room to leave was her personal library. “It is funny that one can miss the books as much as I do, it’s as if they were part of my blood.”In October 2017, I meet Linda, a regal-looking woman with glasses and silver hair. We sit in the lobby of a hotel in downtown Helsinki, a few blocks from the apartment she lives in today. When she first moved, she bought a bed, a TV and a broken sofa from the previous tenant. She didn’t bother to get any chairs – she didn’t think she’d be there long. It’s been more than six years. The problems with her old house started in 2008, when she began to get fevers and developed issues with her voice. A building company found high levels of mould in her basement. She says that, although she tried to get her house cleaned, the mould seeped its way into all her belongings. She began to feel so ill that she had no choice but to abandon her home. After leaving, her symptoms persisted and her health continued to deteriorate. She tells me she became highly sensitive to other buildings, minuscule levels of mould, and chemicals or smells. When she went to the doctor, she was told these multiple chemical sensitivities couldn’t be related to her mould exposure – she had moved, there was no way she could still be sick. She gave up. “I was so tired I really hoped the next fever would kill me. I didn’t try to find any help any more. In a way, life was over.”Linda has sick building syndrome, or SBS, a controversial condition with many definitions and symptoms and even more proposed explanations. A basic definition is that it’s an illness a person gets from a building they live or work in. Speculated causes have included dust, microbes, carpets, ventilation and, like in Linda’s story, mould. Other researchers have claimed there are psychological forces at play, that SBS is related to anxiety, dissatisfaction at home or work, or other mental conditions. Sick building syndrome was a common term in the 1980s and 1990s. It has since faded out of use in the US, where I live, but continues to be studied and discussed in Nordic countries like Denmark and Finland.Origami-inspired skyscraper designed for disaster zones wins contestI came to Helsinki to meet members of an online SBS community, including Linda. Another member of the group, Jesse*, a slim 17-year-old with dyed blonde hair, tells me that he and his mum also had to leave their home. “I was getting sick every winter and summer when the temperature dropped,” he says. “I got the flu, I got headaches, my legs hurt, my head hurt, rashes on my skin, everything like that.” They found mould growing in the walls of their house and had to desert their clothes, all their furniture. “Everything,” he says. Family photos were salvaged and wrapped in plastic. They are going to make photocopies of them through their coverings. Jesse says he often has reactions at school. Sometimes he has to do his classwork in the hallways, away from other students. His visits to the doctor didn’t yield any help. “Because it wasn’t any sort of flu or any kind of bacteria or virus, we were all right,” he says. The doctors told them there was nothing wrong.In 2013, Linda found a doctor who thought he could help, and through “nutritional therapy” she eventually felt well enough to rejoin the world. She doesn’t think her illness and sensitivity will ever go away, but within months of starting treatment, she managed to go on a skiing trip with her daughter.Others are not so lucky. Maria*, 40, says that doctors in Finland are too quick to label SBS as psychological. In 2012, she got sick from her office where she worked in child services. She would get stomach pains, infections, high blood pressure – all medical issues she had never had before. In 2014, mould was found in the building but, despite loving her work, she had already left the job. By 2015, she wasn’t able to go into other buildings too. But being diagnosed with SBS in Finland does not open up access to support.“When I got sick, there was no place for me to go,” says Maria. “I couldn’t get any money. No sick pay, nothing. No rehabilitation, no retraining in a new profession, no unemployment benefit. I was being left out without any rights at all, with nothing.”There must be a psychosocial element, some research claimed. How else to explain that women are more likely to have SBS than men? Or that employees’ wellbeing could be associated with floor plans and office arrangement, office noise or how much control they had over their environment? Hedge’s own work examined SBS questionnaire answers from thousands of workers in various buildings. “We didn’t find any evidence of an actual syndrome. In other words, no consistent pattern of all of the symptoms.” In the end, he says, they “don’t really know whether it’s the building or it’s the people”.Hedge has had a long career of tackling building-related health problems and says the “building or people” puzzle isn’t easy to solve. In one of his cases, people felt ill only in the mornings between 09.30 and 10.00. When the air was tested (later in the day), nothing unusual was detected. Hedge eventually found a cause that explained the odd timing: carbon monoxide from the morning’s arriving cars was rising into the office through elevator shafts.An office in Montreal with 2,000 employees was on the verge of evacuation because of a bad odour. Hedge says everyone was worried it was a “sick building” and that their health had been affected. He found only a couple of mouldy oranges left in the desk of an employee on vacation. Smelly, but not dangerous. “But the reaction,” he points out, “it was a genuine reaction. You smell something, you don’t know what it is. You’ve heard there is a problem and pretty quickly you can feel bad.” After SBS had peaked, Hedge says he started to hear about another disorder: multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS). People who claim they have it say they can be intolerant to any chemicals or materials in any building. I ask Hedge to apply his standard line of inquiry: is it caused by the buildings or the people?“I have no doubt that they have a problem,” he says diplomatically. “The question is, how much is that problem related to their environment or how much is it related to what they think might be in the environment?” The bigger problem, Hedge says, is that people who suffer from SBS or MCS often get lost in the medical system. They’re shuttled between medical doctors who can’t find anything wrong with them physically and psychiatrists who say their symptoms are imagined. Neither offer treatment. People can end up homeless, broke and feeling cynical about doctors and therapists alike, just like it has played out in Finland.“Over time, these people will find each other,” he says. “And then when they find each other, it’s like the Flat Earth Society. They reinforce each other. These are people who are desperate for an explanation for what’s happening to them. And in the absence of that, all they have is their imagination.”On a frigid morning at a cafe in downtown Helsinki, Anna* orders a hot chocolate. She tells me there are thousands of people in Finland who are sick from indoor mould exposures, who have been told they are crazy, referred to psychiatrists, have lost their jobs, left vacant furnished houses and, in some cases, destroyed their homes. True to Hedge’s advisory, she also belongs to the group of people with SBS and MCS from indoor mould who meet in Helsinki every few months.Her own experience began when she started getting frequent coughs, colds and flu-like symptoms in the summer of 2014. At first, she attributed them to her grandchildren, whom she was babysitting on the weekends. You know kids, she tells me – they always want to “puss”, she says, puckering her lips and miming kisses in the air. But her health steadily got worse. She always felt tired, her voice would disappear and she would cough all the time.Anna is a medical doctor and worked in a hospital at the time. “We had occupational doctors, and I went and said, ‘Something strange is happening to me.’” She wondered whether her immunity had somehow been compromised? Was her thyroid damaged? Did she have HIV?Linda uses a blue light to sterilise her belongings“We took all the tests I suggested and everything was clear. I started to think about very unusual things. I am a doctor, but could not understand.” When she went on sick leave for a week, her voice returned. Back at the hospital, it disappeared again and the coughing returned. That’s when she started to think it was related to the building.Anna tells me that she had heard about mould illness before she got sick, but she didn’t consider that it was happening to her. Until, that is, her technicians found a large mushroom growing in the lab next to her office. Her boss told her that they would renovate, and that when she returned from sick leave she would work in a different office on a different floor, away from the lab. When she went back in January 2015, her symptoms started up again. Doctors told her there was no logical explanation. “They said that I am afraid,” she says. “That I was imagining. It was so offensive.”Her last day at work was in February 2015, when a technician pointed out how strange her breathing sounded. Anna says it was a wake-up call: “I tried with all my efforts,” she says. “I thought that I should overcome, I should stand it. And the technician said to me, ‘No, you are not breathing well.’ And then I looked at myself, and I thought, ‘This is really crazy, I will kill myself.’”Eventually, she found herself in the position of so many people with SBS. She wanted to work, she loved her profession – but how can you have a job without being able to go into a building? Instead, she started to research mould-related illness and its after-effects and to work out her rights.I ask her what she thinks about psychological treatment, which is often turned to in the absence of any confirmed physical cause. Even if their illness wasn’t caused by mental problems, couldn’t someone who has lost everything benefit from therapy? She is adamant in her answer: “Psychiatric therapy? No. They don’t need it. They need new apartments. A place to stay. A place where they can breathe. They are strong people, they have overcome such difficult situations. They don’t need this ‘blah blah blah’. They need real help, real support.” Linda left her former home after developing a mould-related illnessAnna doesn’t strike me as an imaginative hypochondriac. She is level-headed, forceful, clear and has a seemingly perfect memory. There is no doubt in my mind not to believe her, and the debate over mould illness and SBS seems ridiculous. They found a huge mushroom in her office, how could there be any dispute?I continued to think this about pretty much every mould sufferer I met: most had documentation to show me the proof of mould contamination found in their home or office. How could a real mould exposure be considered psychological? But I soon recognised that it wasn’t that initial exposure being contested. It was the continuation of symptoms – the cough and breathing problems that Anna had, even after the mushroom had been removed, the lab renovated and she relocated to a “clean” office. Those were the symptoms that were harder to explain and impossible, according to Anna, for doctors and insurance companies to accept were real and deserving of “real” help and support instead of psychiatric help.Anna says that one of the most upsetting parts of her illness was being disappointed by her own profession. “I was so perplexed because I am a medical doctor, I always wanted to help people,” she tells me. “I was taught I should believe what patients tell me about their illness, I should do my best. And when I was in the position of a patient, nobody really wanted to help me. Why is that?”Eventually, though, like others in her group, she found the one doctor who would believe her symptoms were real.Ville Valtonen, a bald 73-year-old in a pressed coat and a dark cap, waves me over to his car. We’re driving to Helsinki University Central Hospital, where he worked for more than four decades. His SBS history lesson is the same as Hedge’s: the energy crisis led to a change in building practices, and the patients followed. The first ones he saw came in the late 1980s. They would be previously healthy, usually early middle-aged people who had started getting repeated infections. The laboratory was refurbished but still Anna’s symptoms persistedValtonen’s career then was centred on the link between strokes and infection. Now, in his retirement, he is returning to the mystery of those early patients. He is one of the few doctors in Finland who is willing to give mould patients a diagnosis, which he calls Dampness and Mould Hypersensitivity Syndrome.Valtonen defines five stages of the disease. They’re based, he says, on the progression of the syndrome that he’s seen in the hundreds of people he’s treated. First, a history of exposure to mould in water-damaged buildings, then an increase in infections. Third comes SBS, and fourth, MCS. Finally, an enhanced scent sensitivity, meaning a person is extremely sensitive to the smell of moulds, “a hundred-fold more accurate than normal,” he says. In Valtonen’s model, SBS is just one factor of the overall illness. He says there is still hope for a mould-exposed patient with only SBS, because their symptoms will stay away if they avoid any source of mould or chemical that triggers them. “But if the patient has gone forward to this mould and chemical sensitivity, it is almost impossible to cure completely,” he says. “And if you have electromagnetic sensitivity, it’s hopeless.”Although he tells me that many of his patients have it, I’m sceptical of this symptom, as repeated studies have shown that participants cannot tell when they’re being exposed to electromagnetic fields. He says many of his mould patients can no longer use mobile phones. Some develop chronic fatigue syndrome, unable to walk even 10 metres others develop epileptic seizures, but show normal electrical activity in the brain when tested. That’s a lot of different symptoms, I venture, so what does he think is going on? Valtonen says he can’t e into researching the mechanism as deeply as he would like. “I’m 73 and I’m too old to get any grants and do anything, so I’m only going to see those patients I have now,” he tells me. His theory is that the illness involves an immunological reaction that combines with secondary infections. Insurance broker warns toxic mould could become the \u0027new asbestos\u0027Many of his SBS patients describe Valtonen as the doctor they were lucky to find. He was a turning point in their illness, a moment when they could finally get better, because he gave them a diagnosis. But as we talk, I’m struck by how he doesn’t really offer treatment – his advice is simply to avoid any and all triggering exposures. The most valuable thing he provides, I think, is his acceptance of the biological nature of their symptoms.“I can’t be a doctor who doesn’t believe, what is that?” he says as we leave the hospital. “In my 45-year clinical career I’ve very seldom, very seldom seen patients who lied to me.”But as I would soon find, it’s not always as simple as being lied to or told the truth. When I meet Kirsi Vaali, Merja Lindström and Mikko*, they excitedly tell me something that I want to believe: Mikko is a mould patient they have cured. Lindström is a homeopath and Vaali is a biomedical researcher at the University of Helsinki. Before researching mould, Vaali studied food allergies and chronic fatigue syndrome – she has an interest in diseases that others cast off as psychological, she says. She emphatically tells me that mould illness is actually related to mitochondrial damage, and that she has a candidate gene that could predict susceptibility.This is the moment when doubts begin to surface in my mind. It was easier to offer my belief, as Valtonen does, to the patients. Their stories weren’t focused so much on medicine or mechanism, but on life, and the ways it was taken from them when they started to feel sick. Now, faced with the “science” of this disease, I find my faith wavering. In 48 short hours, I’ve been told this illness is an innate immune system problem, an inflammation problem, an autoimmune disorder, a blood-brain barrier issue, an oxidative stress problem, and now mitochondrial damage and a genetic disorder? I have yet to see any data and I want details. Has Vaali taken blood samples from patients? Could they see or measure mitochondrial damage in people with SBS? What, I ask, is the connection between immune system function and mitochondria?Vaali and Mikko start laughing, and I worry I’ve asked a stupid question. In fact, I’ve asked a fundamental one that they have no idea how to answer. Vaali shrugs: “That question is impossible to answer.”In the course of our conversation, Vaali adds to a growing list of putative mechanisms and symptoms, telling me that women are more susceptible because of their hormones, because toxins go into fat stores and because of a lack of liver enzymes, and that mould patients have altered sleep rhythms. Instead of going into scientific detail on these topics, Vaali and Lindström mostly want to talk about how patients could be helped. Using Mikko as a case study, they tell me that through homeopathy and natural supplements, these people can be “rescued”. What are these miracle supplements? Vaali won’t tell me straight away, and neither will Lindström. I ask no less than four times over two hours, tolerating digressions and caveats that for each person it is a little different, or that I probably don’t have the same supplements abroad. At last, Vaali shows me Mikko’s regimen, made up of very basic vitamins and nutrients. Most are supplements that I also currently take. Vitamin B, iron, omega-3, curcumin (the active ingredient in turmeric) and a few blends of fatty lipids. Vaali also advises against eating gluten, and Lindström says only organic food is allowed. Cheese and other mouldy foods are bad, because those can be triggers. Wine is OK, but only organic wines with no additives. Litigation fear over toxic mould invading one in four UK homesI begin to have a gnawing feeling, one I’d suppressed when I heard that Valtonen makes patients better without doing much of anything, or that “nutritional therapy” had turned Linda’s life around. I haven’t yet doubted the illness or its symptoms, but its alleged treatment is stirring up suspicions. If SBS is purely a physiological disease, caused by something as serious as an immune disorder or mitochondrial damage, how can it be “rescued” with vitamin B?Lindström shows me her homeopathic pills that she takes for mould illness, which I look over with raised eyebrows. I try to keep an open mind, but I know that homeopathic medicines have such low concentrations of active ingredients they can’t possibly have any biological effect. I do think that healthy eating and lifestyle can help overall mental and physical health – and the treatment of chronic disease. What I question is their application as a fix-it for a specific pathology, especially one that’s unknown. We have a link between saturated fat and heart disease, but what is the link between gluten-free organic food and decreased sensitivity to chemicals? Biodynamic wine and electrical sensitivity? Homeopathic arsenic tablets and mycotoxins? Mikko senses my scepticism. He tells me he doesn’t believe in this stuff either. He’s a general practitioner and a child psychiatrist, and let the supplements sit in his closet for nine months before trying them. He rejected the homeopathic pills and affectionately calls Lindström a “witch doctor”. But he does believe that the supplements helped make him feel better.Mikko bought a new house in 2003, and his symptoms began in 2007. By the autumn, he was living in a campervan on the street. He says that when all his symptoms – itching, headache, nausea, throat and nose irritation, and eczema – hit at once, it was like “burning in a hell”. He suffered for five years before finding relief with Vaali and Lindström’s treatment. He says it took one or two months to improve at the same time, the ventilation in his house was being cleaned. He attributes his recovery to the combination of both. Mikko has been in psychotherapy for years. He tells me he knows himself very well and is sure this isn’t a psychological disease. “I think different kinds of psychotherapy can help people to stand the hell that they are living,” he says. “But not to cure them from the biological disease that they have.”Later, I get Linda’s list of nutritional therapies. She too is being “cured” with supplements, and I want to compare her regimen. It’s a lot of the same: fatty acids, high doses of B and other vitamins, curcumin, etc. It’s broken down into parts of the day: before breakfast, breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, lunch, after lunch, before dinner… and at least three or four pills each time. Whenever you finish taking your last supplement, you begin gearing up to take the next one.Part of me feels glad she has a solution that works for her, and the same with Mikko. But it also feels like they’re being chained to something else. Whereas the sickness used to control their lives, now it’s the diagnosis and the cure.I take a break for lunch, appreciating the brisk air on my face. As I walk, I think about how much my attitude has changed since I arrived. I’m upset because I feel close to the mould sufferers for reasons I haven’t disclosed to them. That feeling of knowing you’re sick, but being told by doctors that you’re not – I know that feeling.Throughout my life, I’ve regularly gone to the doctor for unexplained symptoms. I’ve gotten scans and painful tests for which, over and over, the results would come back normal. I’ve had three doctors, in different specialities, try to prescribe me antidepressants for physical symptoms. Recently, I struggled with idiopathic dysphagia, meaning I was having trouble swallowing – even choking at times – but there was no reasonable explanation. I had been diagnosed a few years earlier with laryngopharyngeal reflux, a version of acid reflux some gastroenterologists aren’t sure exists because there often isn’t any measurable acid in the throat. I have fallen into natural remedy black holes too, hoping to find the magical supplement that cures me. I go beyond what Vaali and Lindström offer, though never to homeopathy. I add super greens powders to my smoothies, powdered liquorice to help with digestion, digestive enzymes and L-glutamine to help my stomach lining.As a science writer and the child of scientists, I justify a lot of my actions by consulting research. Deep down though, I know that my relationship with my body and the way it feels comes both from how it “really” feels and how I’ve been taught to react to it. In my childhood home, food was labelled for when it would go bad and each person had a hand towel just for them, to control the spread of germs. Going to the doctor, requesting unusual medical tests, searching for something in the body gone wrong – this was the environment I grew up in, a kind of “sick building” in itself. People can end up homeless, broke and feeling cynical about doctors and therapistsA specialist who observed my swallowing, and saw nothing wrong, warned me that if I kept treating my body as if my swallowing was broken, I could, in fact, break it. By not using the muscles in my throat, I could create a weakness and then have a real problem. “No need to create a real issue out of nothing,” she said.Her advice frightened me into eating solid foods again. But I remember thinking: isn’t my issue already “real”?I have always looked at my body as a potential battleground Anna and the others in Helsinki have not. Something clearly happened to them. Could the very real exposure to a toxic mould have pushed them into seeing their body through new eyes? Shown them that this is all it takes for your health to be taken away? That it could be something invisible, growing in the walls, in the air you breathe? It’s such a violation, perhaps other walls start to break down. The wall between emotions and body, thoughts and physical feeling. Perhaps that wall was never there, but they thought it was – and that exposure, that violation, broke the illusion.Risto Vataja, head of the neuropsychiatric clinic at Helsinki University Central Hospital, believes SBS in Finland to be a contagion of ideas rather than a disease. He tells me SBS is so well-known here that it’s common to believe that houses are dangerous, schools and hospitals are dangerous, that any place you go, your health is at risk. He says the media plays a big role in disseminating fear, and he scrutinises my intentions with this story. Later, he will email me to say, “Good luck with your article, and don’t make people sick, you journalists have the power...” Still, he hesitates to call SBS a psychiatric or psychosomatic disorder, instead preferring the word “functional”, which is also used to describe conditions like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. “Functional means that they are not psychiatric,” he emphasises. “Psychology is probably involved in the mechanism, and we know that in patients with functional disorders. So, they are real symptoms, but we just cannot identify any good physiological explanation.”Vataja is an advocate for psychological help, like cognitive behavioural therapy. That advocacy probably explains the trouble he’s had reaching patient groups, who tend to reject any psychological component. “We agree that we are not able to help them enough,” he says. “We agree that the healthcare system has not thought enough about these problems, and that we don’t have enough research. We have lots of common things that we agree on and we should try to build on those.”Vataja thinks that telling patients to avoid all buildings that make them feel sick only furthers the illness. “Some colleagues of mine can increase the burden of these patients,” he says. I had seen Ville Valtonen’s unwavering belief as a source of relief for his patients, but was he at the same time perpetuating the disease? Did they have mould illness before they went to see him, or only after? Valtonen remains convinced that avoidance is the best available treatment – although he accepts that controlled studies to prove this theory would be beneficial.I turn to Juha Pekkanen, head of the Department of Public Health at the University of Helsinki and a researcher at the National Institute for Health and Welfare. He tells me that, according to studies they’ve done comparing European countries, Nordic countries should be less prone to dampness and mould. There’s less humidity and very dry air during their cold winters. There might be a slight chance of more exposure because people spend more time inside, or that dry winter air could add irritation to respiratory systems, but there’s no solid reason why there is more mould illness – except for the fact that people know about it. “We know worry causes symptoms and causes disease,” he says, “so we want to build trust and reduce worry.”He is one of the researchers assigned to set up a governmental programme to provide aid to people with SBS. How? “It’s not obvious yet, but of course we need to help these people. There are people who are living in tents and bad situations. Anybody within a bad situation we should somehow extend a hand and try to help them.”It was encouraging to hear someone affiliated with the government saying this, because some patients had suggested there was little care for their outcomes. Pekkanen says that’s not true, but he thinks a focus on mechanism and diagnosis has clouded the issue. He hopes that whatever they design to help people will be more practical. Jesse and his mother left their home for a new apartment block when he started getting sick“I think we should try to get them back to the society, and not build separate communities somewhere in the woods with no electricity, no chemicals, no nothing. There’s no end to that,” he says. “That’s not going to help these people. If you just focus on making it cleaner and cleaner and cleaner, it stops never.”He doesn’t think they’re “playing sick” though. Why would you pretend to have an illness that is not approved for compensation? He thinks that once a person encounters an issue with indoor air, they get real irritation and respiratory symptoms. But once they have these symptoms, some people begin to expect something more, something more sinister. “For many people, it is likely due to some kind of nocebo effect. You’ve heard about the nocebo effect?” he asks me. “Basically, expectation. I don’t like this categorisation between physical and psychological, I think it’s been shown we’re one whole, our psyche and self are intertwined, inseparable.”The placebo effect pervades much of the history of medicine, and explains why in the past some remedies, surgeries and treatments appeared to work despite our now knowing they are inert. More recently, attention has turned to nocebo, the reverse effect. The two aspects of nocebo effects are negative expectations and conditioning. Negative expectations are when you assume an outcome will be bad and then perceive it to be so. This has been shown in studies where patients experience side-effects to sham treatments only because they were warned about those side-effects in advance. Conditioning can occur when you associate a certain activity, place, drug (or anything) with a feeling or symptom. Studies of positive conditioning have shown that patients can find relief from allergic rhinitis symptoms through conditioning with a flavoured drink, can have conditioned immunosuppression and conditioned growth hormone increase. It’s been speculated that some of the negative side-effects of chemotherapy can be attributed to negative conditioning. But calling something placebo or nocebo doesn’t mean it’s not real or physical. “Neuroscientific investigations from the last 15 years have shown that the placebo effect is in fact a real biological phenomenon due to the psychosocial context of the patient and the therapy,” authors of a 2013 review wrote. Nocebo effects are associated with changes in several brain areas, neurotransmitters and hormones.Keith Petrie, a professor of health psychology at the University of Auckland, has studied how nocebo effects can stem from the idea that the environment, medicine, architecture and technological advances in food are causes of poor health. In 2001, the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry had announced they would be spraying insecticide to eradicate an invasive moth species, the painted apple moth. Petrie surveyed 292 residents about their current health symptoms and any health worries they had, then followed up after spraying. Higher levels of worry were associated with a higher number of symptoms attributed to the spray programme.“If people believe that they’re sensitive about a particular stimulus and then they’re exposed to it, then they report symptoms,” he says.When I ask him how Finland’s mould patients could possibly feel better from natural supplements, or from seeing a doctor who doesn’t give them medicine, Petrie says: “The good thing about treatment, any kind of treatment, is it shifts your perceptions. You go to somebody with a problem and say you’ve got the flu or a cold – you’re focused on how terrible you feel and your headache and your cough. You go to see someone and they give you a treatment and the way you’re viewing your illness shifts immediately. Instead of looking at how sick you are, you look for signs of recovery.” But it can go the other way too. Research has shown that placebo and nocebo effects can also be triggered by interactions with a doctor, even if your doctor tries to empathise with you. A 2015 review concluded that “reassuring patients that there is nothing physically wrong with them, when they are in a great deal of pain, can leave them feeling misunderstood and delegitimised”. Another study looked at doctor-patient interactions in patients who complained of symptoms but had no diagnosis. They were assigned to two groups, one where the doctor said they didn’t know what was wrong and another where the patient was given a firm diagnosis and reassured they would be better in a few days. After two weeks, 64 per cent of the patients in the group with a diagnosis reported getting better while only 39 per cent of those in the group without did. If there’s one thing common to all the mould patients, it’s being dismissed by doctors and being told their symptoms were unexplained. After reading these findings, I wonder if their true toxic exposure was to this uncertainty. It seems it can be harmful to your health to hear that what’s taking place in your body is a mystery. There are researchers who haven’t given up on this mystery and are hunting for a biological explanation. Thomas Dantoft, at the Centre for Clinical Research and Prevention in Denmark, is looking for biomarkers: differences somewhere in the body between people with MCS or other functional disorders and those without. He is also project coordinator for the Danish study of Functional Disorders (DanFunD), the first large, coordinated epidemiological study focusing exclusively on functional disorders.The cohort includes 9,656 men and women who were surveyed for fibromyalgia, whiplash-associated disorder, MCS, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and bodily distress syndrome. The study includes interviews and personality tests and collects plasma, DNA, urine, gut bacteria and more. Participants will be followed until 2020 and hopefully will provide some much-needed epidemiological information. Because it isn’t just the sufferers who have numerous conflicting hypotheses about the cause of their illness. I spent weeks reading different papers – ning decades of research – on biological causes of MCS. Several implicated the immune system, validating one of the theories I was told in Helsinki, but other work contradicted them. One of Valtonen’s stages of the disease is an increased sense of smell, but Dantoft says that his and other studies have shown that isn’t true. What about psychological factors? Dantoft says he isn’t sure either way. He says functional disorder patients live in dire conditions and it would be incredible if they didn’t get depressed. “All studies working with MCS and other sorts of disorders, whatever you want to call them, show that there is higher risk of anxiety and depression,” he says. “But we don’t really know what comes first, and that also doesn’t mean that they are making it up. Maybe people who are at higher risk of getting depressed also have a higher risk of getting MCS? But that doesn’t mean you can cure MCS by treating the depression, necessarily.”Dantoft thinks mental help could be offered not as a fix, but as a stand-in until more is known. “The big issue is that the patients and the clinicians aren’t being honest with each other,” he says. “Because the fact is we have absolutely no efficient treatment to offer these people.” Is the building sick, or are the people? I’m frustrated that I’m no closer to answering this question. I also feel guilt. Guilt that my reporting led me to question the experiences of the people I met in Helsinki, and for my nagging intuition that there is more going on than just mould exposure. Faced with the option of building or people, real or not real, I still can’t settle on one.When I ask Linus Andersson, a cognitive scientist at Umeå University in Sweden, he tells me why: it’s been the wrong question all along. He is collaborating with chemist Anna-Sara Claeson, and together they are doing the most comprehensive work that I could find on mould and toxin exposure in people who report that they have MCS. “I have felt pushed towards choosing whether or not I would follow psychological or medicalbiological lines of work,” he says. “But I came to the conclusion that it’s not even a real question. Or, there is an answer: it is always both.”For the past decade, Claeson and Andersson have been exposing people to different compounds and measuring any effects on blood flow using brain scans, inflammatory markers in the mucus from the upper airways and, recently, gene expression. Over Skype, they show me their exposure chamber, which looks a bit like a phone booth – only with no phone. In this tiny room is where most of their experiments take place. In an experiment published in 2015, they exposed participants with MCS (along with controls) to a compound called n-butanol, which they chose because people find it hard to decide whether it smells good or bad. For the first ten minutes there was nothing, then the n-butanol increased to a set level and plateaued. MCS participants, compared with controls, reported greater perceived odour intensities, more unpleasantness from the exposure, and increasing symptoms over time. The MCS group also reported more symptoms in the 10 minutes before they were exposed to anything. Andersson thinks this could be associated with nocebo-like expectations, but he also says that to him, expectations producing symptoms doesn’t mean that an illness is imagined.He tells me that people often have allergic reactions without a “real” exposure. In a 2007 study on food allergies, it was found that children could have reactions to placebos: more than one in 10 of the food challenges produced false positives. The symptoms were real: intense bodily responses like rashes, hives, diarrhoea and vomiting. Claeson and Andersson say this shows that the body is very good at predicting and defending itself from what it thinks will be damaging, which should make researchers cautious when interpreting nocebo and placebo results. In a 2017 paper, Claeson and Andersson describe exposing people with chemical intolerance (along with controls) to the chemical acrolein. Chemicals are detected in the upper airways by the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. The olfactory nerves are involved in smell, while the trigeminal nerves can evoke irritation or pain. They found that people with MCS reported greater irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, even when acrolein’s smell was masked. Because their aggravated symptoms didn’t require them to be smelling the chemical, Andersson and Claeson think perhaps people with MCS could have altered trigeminal reactivity, and will continue to look into that.No study they’ve done yet has offered the mechanism of MCS on a silver platter. Andersson says their goal is to find some kind of exposure that separates an MCS sufferer from a control. It doesn’t matter what it is if they can find it, he thinks it would lead to a better understanding of how and why these patients respond differently. What does he think about natural supplements or homeopathy “curing” MCS? “My answer to this question is basically the same as for that pertaining to explanatory theories – the claims need to be backed up with data,” he replies. “When, or if, homeopathic treatment regimens would actually fulfil scientific criteria, then I would not be against it per se. I have yet to see such studies, however. So, my question for everyone who makes theories and statements of how MCS can be treated is – where’s the structured data?”I asked Vaali and Lindström so many times to tell me about their supplements, and their lack of data pushed me away from their cause rather than towards it. But while Andersson and Claeson’s mindset and careful research are refreshing, it’s all still exploratory. Unlike Vaali and Lindström, their work doesn’t offer an easy solution someone can take today, right now. It doesn’t allow patients to move from the world of the sick to the world of the well. What Andersson and Claeson can provide now is relief from all those dichotomies: building or person sick or well organic or made up. I can’t tell you if SBS or MCS or mould illness is “real”, but I know now that our definition of real is flawed. The split between psychological and physical is flawed the idea that psychological isn’t real is flawed the notion that psychological is not inherently physiological is flawed. These isions are what led to this health crisis in Finland, not abnormal levels of mould. I went to Helsinki and was asked to believe. And I do. I believe that Anna’s symptoms are real. I believe that Maria was mistreated by doctors and by her employers, that Jesse and his mother felt alone, and that Linda was neglected by her housing company. I believe that they should be helped. But I have one belief that I worry disqualifies all the others. I also believe that, after an initial mould exposure has been resolved, understanding the continuation of any symptoms must include a consideration of the mind. It pains me to know that the people I interviewed in Helsinki, who so graciously shared their stories, time and vulnerability with me, will probably be displeased with my version of their story. This is not the exposé they were hoping for, not a condemnation of the Finnish government nor the uncovering of a plot to keep mould patients quiet to avoid the costs of rebuilding and social security. People at the hospitals and National Institute for Health and Welfare sounded seriously concerned and are implementing programmes like the one Pekkanen mentioned to try to bridge the gap between officials and patient groups who feel wronged. Claeson says that while researchers can’t yet give people a cure, they can do their best to keep looking, keep trying to help. That in itself is a kind of belief. It’s not exactly like Valtonen’s, but it’s belief all the same.“I think it’s important to take the people that are suffering, to take them seriously,” she says. “I think that if we do research, that means that it’s a ‘real’ problem. And I think that is something that we can offer.”* Some names have been changed in this article.This piece was first published on Mosaic by Wellcome and is republished here under a Creative Commons licence.A 2006 study used data from the Whitehall II study to explore the role of the work environment in explaining sick building syndrome.In an article published in 2017, Ville Valtonen describes how sick building syndrome is one of five clinical criteria he uses to diagnose Dampness and Mould Hypersensitivity Syndrome.Research published in 1987 looked at the effects of GPs using a “positive” or “non-positive” manner with their patients.This 2007 paper describes children’s allergic reactions to placebo.The Danish study of Functional Disorders was described in a 2017 paper.Some of Linus Andersson and Anna-Sara Claeson’s research can be found in papers from the study using n-butanol and the study using acroleinor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In fact, the strangeness of our own universe might better be explained by an undiscovered natural law, they said.The idea of the multiverse comes about because in physics terms, our universe is very lucky to exist at all.Scientists launch huge survey to find alien lifeCurrent theories predict there should be much more dark energy inside of our own universe than there is. That is a problem because adding more dark energy would lead it to expand so quickly that any matter would be diluted before it could form the stars or planets that we need to live.In response to that, some have suggested that we might in fact be living inside of a multiverse. There are in fact lots of different universes – many of which will have more dark energy and so could not host life – and we simply live inside one that worked out in the right way.But the new study suggests that we might have been overstating how lucky we are. It might actually be possible for stars and planets to form even if there is much more dark energy.“We asked ourselves how much dark energy can there be before life is impossible?” said Pascal Elahi, a research fellow at the University of Western Australia. ”Our simulations showed that the accelerated expansion driven by dark energy has hardly any impact on the birth of stars, and hence places for life to arise. Even increasing dark energy many hundreds of times might not be enough to make a dead universe.”It is still true that our universe could be very special. But it does not need to be quite so special, the researchers showed.“The multiverse was previously thought to explain the observed value of dark energy as a lottery – we have a lucky ticket and live in the Universe that forms beautiful galaxies which permit life as we know it,” said Luke Barnes, a John Templeton research fellow at Western Sydney University.“Our work shows that our ticket seems a little too lucky, so to speak. It’s more special than it needs to be for life. This is a problem for the multiverse a puzzle remains.”That puzzling fact might suggest that the multiverse theory is not true in the first place. The study does not rule out the idea but does suggest that the small amount of dark energy in our universe would be better explained by a law of nature that we do not yet know about.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Negotiations on the future with the UK have no started yet. We have had first exploratory discussions.”Ms May had tried to steady nerves about her approach with an article on Sunday, in which she asked the British public to “trust me” on Brexit.Her supporters hoped it would draw a line under public spats on customs. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt even issued a “belt up” message to foreign secretary Boris Johnson after he called the “partnership” model – thought to be favoured by the PM – “crazy” last week.Jeremy Hunt: Brexit debates should happen in private“What we need to do is, as she said, come out of the customs union in such a way as to enable us to have frictionless trade with no hard border in Northern Ireland and to do unhindered, unimpeded free trade deals with the rest of the world. We think that is possible, she thinks that is possible, so that is the way forward.”Theresa May wants our ‘trust’ over Brexit.

Close aides of Ms May have also called it “intellectually perfect”.But Downing Street has been privately warned that the customs partnership proposal could collapse the government, with the Brexit-backing European Research Group having organised a critical report backed by 60 MPs.The group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called the proposal “cretinous” and “deeply unsatisfactory”, and argued that it would “not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for”.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The other option, a “streamlined arrangement”, is viewed more favourably by Brexiteers in both the cabinet and on the back benches.It is known as “maximum facilitation”, or “max fac”, and would see the UK outside any customs union, but with some controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Backers say a “trusted trader” scheme and remote monitoring of the border would limit physical infrastructure.But it would still essentially mean a hard border on the island of Ireland. Critics claim this would break the Good Friday Agreement, risking peace in Northern Ireland.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This goes beyond party politics – it’s more important than party politics.”The House of Lords voted to make keeping the UK inside the European Economic Area (EEA), and therefore the single market, a negotiating priority – throwing the decision back to MPs.But Labour remains opposed, while vowing to negotiate a “strong single market relationship that hardwires the benefits”, without explaining how that will be possible outside the trading bloc.Mr Miliband was speaking ahead of sharing a platform with Nicky Morgan, the former Conservative education secretary, and Nick Clegg, the former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The trio are warning that Britain is being “held to ransom” by hardline Tories hell-bent on a hard Brexit, in the starkest evidence yet that party allegiances are breaking down as battle rages over departure from the EU.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Miliband dismissed chatter about a new centrist party, saying his campaign was pushing for “cross-party working, not for creating a new party”.Bitter cabinet splits made it a “national crisis”, he warned, adding: “The UK has no negotiating position on the fundamental issues that face the country as it contemplates its post-Brexit relationship with the European Union.”Britain to ‘lose influence’ in global security operations after BrexitMay faces deadlock over Brexit customs rules as both options rubbishedMay urges public to ‘trust me’ to deliver Brexit amid cabinet rowsEU set to push for six-month extension to Brexit transition periodNurses from EU face annual £600 fee for own NHS costs after BrexitHe predicted an “enormous sigh of relief in Europe” if Britain stayed in the single market, because the EU “don’t want a weakened Britain, because they think it will weaken Europe”.The “Norway option” was now “on the table”, after that country’s prime minister made clear it would welcome the UK staying in the EEA.Mr Miliband, who runs a UN charity in New York, said he was also seeing at close quarters how the US, under Donald Trump, was turning away from Europe. “We have to take that into account,” he said.And he rejected Brexiteer protests that revolts in parliament weakened Britain’s negotiating hand, arguing: “What’s more destructive for a government position than having no position?”The three prominent politicians are calling on MPs to stand up to “the hardest of Brexits”, which they characterise as “a fantasy island” of “economic pain” and diminished standing.“Over the coming months, MPs will have the chance to table amendments to bills – and vote for those amendments – which can prevent the country from suffering the long-term damage that a hard Brexit will cause,” they wrote at the weekend.“The pro-Brexit press will angrily protest, but what is the role of MPs if not to improve and protect the lives of their constituents?”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sufficient care and rest during musth “will be ensured”the forests committee will meet at least twice a year – once just before festival season, when all violators should be reported “so that necessary steps are taken for ensuring the safety of the animals as well as that of the public”another meeting will be just after the season to take stock of implementation of the rules Wildlife wardens and forest chiefs discussed the problems at a meeting before issuing the new orders.Kerala has the highest number of festival elephants in India – thought to be about 500. Action for Elephants UK (AfE) has branded the state “ground zero for elephant torture”, and has called their illegal treatment “the worst case of animal cruelty in the world”. The plight of the 150 captive elephants in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is feared to be just as bad.For the six-month festival season, they are forced to walk for miles in searing temperatures on hot, stinging tar roads and ridden into noisy processions with fireworks. Some are carted from one festival to another – up to hundreds of miles – while still chained. Animal advocates say elephants are sensitive, intelligent and sociable creatures and rarely survive the “unrelenting neglect and torture” for a natural life. In the past seven years, 350 captive elephants have died.

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. So excited for the ceremony and proud of all the Embassy staff who worked so hard to make this event happen. Eternally grateful to President Trump for his courage and vision. pic.twitterpGVENzJlBtAbsorption Ministry spokeswoman Elisheva Cohen told the paper: “The ministry is working together in full cooperation with the relevant bodies in order to find an appropriate solution for the residents of the Diplomat compound and will make sure that no new immigrant will be left without a housing solution following June 20, 2020.”Meanwhile, the new embassy is inviting people to watch Monday’s opening ceremony live on its Facebook page. And Mr Friedman, visiting the site, tweeted: “Eternally grateful to President Trump for his courage and vision.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Pass muster with flying colours                REVEALED: This is the reason why bullfinches mate for life But since 2000 they have been increasing nationally according to the Breeding Bird Survey conducted annually by the BTO, RSPB and Joint Nature Conservation Committee.And the 11,000 volunteer members of the BTO\u0026rsquos Garden BirdWatch scheme, who send in weekly records of sightings, have confirmed the upward trend.Last month (April) bullfinches were recorded in 19 per cent of the GBW gardens, nearly double the 20 year average.Over the whole of last year there was a 16 per cent increase in the percentage of gardens reporting them.But the BTO said there is no clear explanation for their apparent recovery.Bullfinches eat fleshy fruits and flower buds and sometimes take sunflower seeds from feeders.In spring, when the male makes his \u0026ldquopew call, they also feed their young insects.Their decline has been blamed on intensive farming and a reduction in food availabilityAnd next month is when the annual peak in sightings occurs as adults bring their newly fledged young to feeders.GBW volunteers also recorded a 15 per cent rise last year in sightings of song thrushes - another bird which has suffered long term declines.Claire Boothby, the BTO GBW Development Officer, said \u0026ldquo2017 saw record reports of Bullfinches from October-December and this year we are on track for the highest-ever records. Will this be the case? We need your help to find out.Kate Risely, Garden BirdWatch Organiser at the British Trust for Ornithology, said \u0026ldquoNot only was 2017 a great year to see Bullfinches, we also recorded more Pied Wagtails (32 per cent more gardens per week), Song Thrushes (+15 per cent), Goldcrests (+11 per cent), and Goldfinches (+5 per cent) in gardens than we did in 2016."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/May-959621.jpg","title":"brexit news uk eu customs union theresa may conservative party mps private meetings","story":"                Rees-Mogg uses HILARIOUS cricket analogy for Theresa May                Kinnock outlines plan to STOP \u0027fantasy island Brexiteers\u0027 running UKDetails of the rival plans for a custom partnership - the option backed by the Prime Minister but rejected by most Euro-sceptic ministers - and the alternative maximum facilitation model involving looser links with Brussels.One Brexit-supporting Tory MP said: I cannot understand why the Prime Minister is still pushing the customs partnership idea. I thought it was dead.In a sign of continuing tensions in the customs debate, one Cabinet minister urged Boris Johnson to stop speaking out in public about the row.The Foreign Secretary angered pro-Brussels ministers last week by denouncing the customs partnership idea as crazy.Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed the EU\u0027s negotiating team was looking to exploit isions within the Government.Mrs May led some of the meetings herself while others were led by senior aidesI do think that it is important that we have these debates in private. Not just because of collective responsibility, which is what democracy depends on, but also because this is a negotiation.On the EU side, if they see isions in the open, they will exploit that, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.Referring to the Foreign Secretary, the Health Secretary added: I actually think he has a very important role to play in the Government and he is the architect of the whole Brexit campaign and we are listening to what he says and we are doing what he wants.But I think we have to recognise that we are not the only people who read the papers in Britain and we need to give Theresa May some space.If we are going to have these lively debates, we should have them in private because that will strengthen Theresa May\u0027s negotiating hand.Asked if his message to Mr Johnson was to belt up, Mr Hunt said: You could say that. I\u0027d say he is a marvellous Foreign Secretary but let\u0027s work as a team.On Sunday evening, the Prime Minister\u0027s former Cabinet ally Damian Green suggested the customs partnership plan was unlikely to work.He claimed the current customs union may have to be extended until a more long-term solution can be thrashed out.Mr Green told Radio 4\u0027s The Westminster Hour: This is not the time for members of the Cabinet or anyone else inside the Conservative Party to indulge in ideology.I think the most likely endpoint will be some of what\u0027s called the maximum facilitation, some variant of that.I, personally, am not yet convinced that you could have that in place by the end of 2020, at the end of the implementation period, and, therefore, you might need to bolt on to that another period, a sort of transition period into that, so that we know not only that it works, but that it works from day one.That\u0027s really important, and I think that\u0027s more important than any ideological posturing that seems to be going on over this."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Harry-and-meghan-959640.jpg","title":"royal wedding prince harry meghan markle feature new stamps","story":"The Royal Mail has produced a special set of four stamps showing Harry and MeghanThe images for the souvenir miniature sheet were taken by New York-based photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Frogmore House in Windsor in December.Lubomirski, who has described the couple as being so deliciously in love, has also been chosen by Harry and Ms Markle as their official wedding photographer.The stamps will be released on the morning of the wedding, which takes place this Saturday at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle.Harry and Ms Markle personally approved the set, as did the prince\u0027s grandmother, the Queen, who had the final say.The 1st class stamp shows the couple sitting together holding hands on the steps of Frogmore House, where they will have their evening reception.

Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She needs to solve the housing crisis.The number of people renting in their 30s, 40s, and 50s has nearly doubled in the past decade. Home ownership is at a 30-year low.The average home costs almost eight times average earnings, 11 in London.Brickies and nurses need six- figure deposits to get on the ladder.New Housing Secretary James Brokenshire needs to get radical to solve the issue.The Treasury should find the cash to unleash a building programme.Archaic planning laws need to be scrapped, too. The housing crisis cannot be fixed without building on some of the Green Belt.Construction firms who sit on land to keep supply low and prices high should also be fined to force them to build.The Government was right to slash stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it needs shaking up across the board. Cutting it would encourage older people to downsize and help families upsize.Most people under 40 are not socialists, just smitten by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of freebies. They are aspirational hard-workers, who want a home to call their own. Many are the people Mrs May once called those “Just About Managing”.House reforms are vital for the future of the Tory Party. Next to Brexit, it is the most important thing for them to fix.Mrs May once said it was her mission to solve the housing crisis.Well, PM, what happened?SEXISM has no place in the workplace.Yet almost a third of women say they have been ordered to dress provocatively by bosses, against their wishes.The Government has issued guidelines to stamp this out.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account. Our country is all the better for it.No one who values liberty would have it any other way.BRITISH politics has lost one of its good guys.The outpouring of tributes for Tessa Jowell highlights how widely she was admired as a politician and, more importantly, as a person.

They will help you feel calm and happy.“Read a book, play on your computer, Xbox, PlayStation, play a board game, watch some films whatever you enjoy doing most, try and find some time to do that before Monday.The weather for the weekend looks good. Get yourself outside for a game of football, cricket or whatever sport your enjoy.“Go for a walk or run, climb a tree anything that will get your heart pumping a little.“Remember that exercise lowers your stress levels, makes you feel happy and more alert.He went on to put the SATs results into perspective and told they children he wanted them to do as well as they could.Mr Frost continued: The results you get will not change how wonderful you are, how much family and friends love you or what you are capable of in the future.”Ending the letter he said: Remember that SATs do not test the following qualities: compassion, creativity, happiness, love, generosity, confidence, kindness, faith, bravery and many more things that are far more important in life than long division and adverbial phrases.Parents said that they had sat down with their children and read the letter out together with their children in an age when most communication with schools was online.A similar positive thinking exercise was carried out at the Lakeside Primary School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.Lakeside’s reassuring letter, send out earlier last week, read: Next week you will sit your SATs tests for maths, reading, spelling, grammar and punctuation. We know how hard you have worked, but there is something very important you must know….The SATs tests do not assess all of what makes each of you exceptional and unique. The people who create these tests and score them do not know each of you the way that we do and certainly not in the way your families do.They do not know that some of you speak two languages or that you love to draw and paint. They have not seen your natural talent for acting or playing the ukulele. They do not know that you have entered story writing competitions or street dance competitions.They do not know that you have represented our school at Young Voices. They do not know that your friends can count on you to be there for them, that your laughter can brighten the darkest day or that your face turns red when you feel shy.They do not know that you participate in the school football team, the school netball team or the school cross country team.They do not know that you are obsessed with Harry Potter or Michael Rosen or flossing. They do not know that you wonder about your future, or sometimes help your brother or sister.They do not know that you are kind, trustworthy and thoughtful and that every day you try to be your very best.The outcomes you will get from these tests will tell you something, but they will not tell you everything. There are many ways of being smart. You are smart! So while you are preparing for the tests and in the midst of it all, remember that there is no way to test all of the amazing and awesome things that make you, YOU!This weekend please rest, sleep and believe, because you CAN!”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/15888359obj-js4095873.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dr vaishnavy laxman decapitated baby mum childbirth","story":"A medical tribunal heard Dr Vaishnavy Laxman continued with a bungled delivery despite her colleagues warning of this baby is going to die.The 41-year-old, a consultant gynaecologist at Dundee Hospital at the time, pulled on the breeched babys legs until the head was detached and stuck in the mums womb, the hearing was told.Two other doctors then had to remove the infants head before it was sewed back onto his body so his mother could hold him and say goodbye.Dr Shmaila Siddiki told the hearing: I was so shocked at what was happening. I just said it’s dead, this baby is going to die.I had no confirmation of this as I wasn’t stood near to see, but I just knew. The baby’s heartbeat had dropped.I saw the baby’s legs coming out of the vagina, then she delivered up to the chest, it happened very quickly.”The tragic death happened on March 16, 2014, after the womans waters had broken early.It is alleged Dr Laxman should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section at the hospital in Dundee, as the baby was in a breech position.The hearing previously saw another doctor break down in tears as she recounted having to remove the babys head from his mothers uterus, saying: (It) is the most horrific experience anybody could have and it has haunted me so much.Dr Siddiki told the Manchester tribunal: “If she was fully dilated, the baby could be delivered vaginally but she never communicated with the patient about doing a vaginal delivery.We were set up for a C-section, she had a prolapsed cord and she was 25 plus 6 weeks gestated.I was under the impression we were going to do a C-section and this caused us a delay - I didn’t know what she was planning.After that I saw the feet coming out of the vagina. I admit I didn’t tell her to stop and I saw her pull on the legs.She added: Dr Laxman was encouraging the patient to push and she was pulling the baby down - this was not what I was expecting.I was speaking to another doctor who said how is she going to do it - how is she going to deliver the head.She told the hearing the attempt to pull the baby out last for about 15-20 minutes.Dr Laxman who faces being struck off denies contributing to the death of the baby.Lawyers for the General Medical Council said she should have performed a Caesarean instead of a natural delivery arguing a fragile baby like the infant who died would suffer a lot more damage if pulled or twisted.The tribunal had previously heard from the mother, known as Patient A, who said she had been assured she would be given a C-section in the event of a breech birth.Speaking to the distraught mother Dr Laxmans lawyer Gerard Boyle QC told her: “Dr Laxman has asked me to say she is so very sorry and deeply saddened for the outcome of your baby.The hearing continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406170601.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"common cold cure","story":"UK researchers have identified a key protein in the body that allows the multiple viruses that cause a cold to spread through cells.The new treatment developed at London’s Imperial College blocks the protein, cutting off the infection at an early stage.In lab tests it worked within minutes on human lung cells.

Your actions are being reported to higher authorities.”Eventually after an hour or so the Spanish ship sails away but it comes just days after Gibraltar’s Deputy Chief Minister Dr Joseph Garcia told Members of the United States Congress that he will not cede an inch of its sovereignty, jurisdiction and control as the Rock prepares to leave the European Union.He also pointed to the danger of Spain challenging the status quo by redrawing the borders of Europe at a time of so much uncertainty and instability on the continent.In response to questions about the impact of Brexit, Dr Garcia explained that as the UK prepares to leave the European Union it is engaged in discussions with a number of Member States, including Spain, about Gibraltar.The Government of Gibraltar says it is directly involved in those meetings that are relevant to Gibraltar, positively seeking solutions which do not cross its red lines.“It remains to be seen whether Spain can find the political goodwill to move forward with solutions that do not impact on sovereignty. We welcome such solutions but we will not give an inch on sovereignty, jurisdiction and control. It is clearly not just about sovereignty but about the attributes of sovereignty as well,” Dr Garcia has reiterated.Earlier this year The Sun revealed how the National Anthem God Save The Queen was broadcast after another Spanish vessel was chased off by the Royal Navy following another incursion.In April 2017 The Sun launched its Hands off Our Rock campaign in response to Spain’s muscle flexing bully boy tactics.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I really don’t know what they were thinking. Exploiting animal for entertainment at parties — that time has passed. We know better we’ve been educated.”Mr Magill said he saw the tiger’s ears move to the side of its head, or flat back, both of which aren’t good signs.He added: “That’s what we call helicopter mode. It’s how we read cats.”Officials at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals also blasted the decision, saying wild animals aren’t supposed to serve as prom decorations.A PETA official told NBC News: Displaying a tiger in a tiny cage and allowing students to handle lemurs is cruel to the animals and dangerous for the students, and it sends the harmful message that living beings are props to be used for human amusement.The school’s principal David Pugh has apologised for the tiger’s appearance and said he understood why some people were offended.School officials will now take a look at policies and procedures for events moving forward.Mr Pugh added: “We all have learned a great deal from this experience."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004042801581.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle dad thomas pull out royal wedding","story":"Thomas Markle has instead backed his ex-wife Doria Ragland to walk their daughter down the aisle as the fallout continues after it was revealed he was paid to pose for paparazzi pictures sold to news outlets worldwide.TMZ reported that the father of the bride now intends on checking back into hospital after suffering more chest pains, and that he hasnt been able to speak to the star since his decision not to be by her side for the wedding of the year.Thomas, 73, who also said he had a heart attack a week ago, insisted he will not walk Meghan down the aisle for fear of embarrassing her or the royals over the paparazzi deal.Prince Harry is said to be blaming himself over the last-minute hitch - with Meghan pleading with her dad to change his mind.A source told The Sun: “Meghan is devastated and wants her father to be there. They’re trying to work this out so he will come after all.”Thomas no-show revelation, just four days before the wedding at Windsor’s St George’s Chapel, caught the Palace completely by surprise - throwing its plans into chaos.Kensington Palace said last night: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding.“She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.”Thomas, who lives in Rosarito, Mexico, was supposed to be flying to London this week to meet the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, Wills and Kate at a lunch ahead of the ceremony.It is understood Meghan, 36, had already asked her to be on standby in case Thomas was too unwell to come to the UK.Thomas admitted in an interview with US website TMZ that he did a deal with a photo agency to take pictures of him, saying he meant “no harm.”The photographs showed him in Rosarito reading a book on British history, working out with weights, being measured for a wedding suit and looking up Harry and Meghan at an internet café.The pictures were sold around the world — before the Mail On Sunday revealed they had been staged.His confession is embarrassing for Kensington Palace, which had issued strong legal letters in an attempt to protect Thomas’s privacy.He admitted in the interview that the staged paparazzi pictures looked “stupid and hammy.”A source said: “Tom was really upset when he was photographed looking unkempt and dishevelled earlier this year.“He thought they made him look like a lush and he wanted a more positive image of him out there.“So that’s why he colluded with the picture agency and photographer to do better shots.”Thomas admitted accepting money from agency Coleman Rayner for the pictures.He also said he had suffered a heart attack last Tuesday and had checked himself out of hospital so he could attend the wedding.The chaos has also hit Prince Harry hard, with a pal telling the Daily Mail: The couple have been doing everything they can to help him.This is not what she wants. She obviously wants her dad there. And the idea of contemplating him not being there now is not something that she wants to have to do.He [Harry] is devastated.

It was not for money.”She said she had no idea if he had been paid but added: “If he was it would have been a pittance. I’m entirely the culprit.I said to him to show the world ‘I’m getting in shape and getting healthy’ so I suggested it to benefit him and the Royal family.”Thomas’s grandson Tyler Dooley, 25, yesterday said his granddad had suggested only on Sunday that he would be at the wedding. He said: “My grandfather is in pieces – he is broken. He is not doing well.“He is a very reclusive guy — he has been in the spotlight his entire life behind the cameras and now he has been thrusted into all this with the Royals.“It is overwhelming. My grandfather just wants to be left alone — he wants the peace and the quiet back.”Tyler, a debt recovery worker, said of his Sunday discussion with Thomas: “He emailed me and I emailed him back.“He said he’s had some serious complications because of the stress, anxiety and pressure. I was also told that he had a heart attack. He had a pretty big health scare.“He told me that he loves me very much and he’s sorry about everything that’s happening.“He said plans to get the care and the help he needs after the wedding — which told me that he was going.”Tyler said he believes that Thomas will change his mind again and go to the ceremony — because he loves Meghan so much.He added: “There is no way he is not going to go to that wedding. That is his daughter and she loves him more than anything in the world.“I couldn’t be more proud of Meghan — she is everything to me.“She knows she has a big support base behind her and that’s all she needs to know.”If Thomas does not turn up, Doria will be the bride’s only immediate relative at Saturday’s wedding.But Tracey Dooley, estranged wife of Meghan’s brother Thomas Jr, is already in London with her two sons despite not having an invite.The three are set to appear on Good Morning Britain as part of the show’s Royal wedding coverage."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004042801581.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle father thomas photo deal","story":"The 73-year-old was caught up in controversy after he posed for paparazzi photographs in the run-up to his daughters big day this Saturday, with the snaps reportedly being sold to news outlets around the world for £100,000.Prince Harry and Meghan have appealed for understanding and respect to be given to the American actress father after he told TMZ that he has pulled out of the royal wedding.The celeb website has also claimed that Mr Markle did not strike the deal with a photo agency for money.He has said that the photos were stupid but were not done for the money.Instead he was keen to re-cast his public image ahead of the big day so the public would think of him in a more positive manner.A Kensington Palace spokesman said: This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding.She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.Meghans half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.The bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault.The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family.We had no idea he would be taken advantage of.

Web-based services like Netflix and BBC iPlayer are the norm for younger people, but a switch would leave the elderly and people in rural areas without their favourite shows, the Social Mobility Foundation said. The BBC is only obliged to provide broadcast programming until 2027, when its current charter runs out. The report said: “Given the current rate at which consumption is shifting, we forecast the next charter period will see at least the start of the BBC’s move to online-only distribution of content.” But almost 40% of households with a single adult over 65 have no internet access, according to the Office for National Statistics.  The SMF said any switch-off of TV signals should only happen after extensive consultations and an improvement in broadband availability. SMF economist Scott Corfe said: “Many people rely on conventional broadcast TV signals and any move to switch them off should only be done slowly, carefully and when people are happy with it.

One in three kids now leaves primary school too fat - with the poorest faring worst. Being too heavy raises later chances of type 2 diabetes, heart, liver disease and several common cancers. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Obesity also warned pressure on the NHS from the next obese generation of youngsters would be “unsustainable” if more is not done to tackle the crisis. MPs and peers backed Jamie Oliver’s calls for a 9pm watershed on junk food ads, and demanded a national obesity strategy to “ensure children are protected from junk food”.  A survey by the APPG also found that nearly 90% of obese people have suffered abuse because of their size. The research also found that 94% of all respondents believe that there is not enough understanding about the causes of obesity. Four in 10 obese people did not feel comfortable talking to their GP about their weight, the survey showed. And more than a third of obese Brits said they had not accessed any lifestyle or prevention services. The APPG demanded new measures to ensure everyone has access to advice and treatment. In a statement, it said: “Access to effective obesity services is currently a postcode lottery, with decisions on funding for obesity services being made by local commissioners. “A whole-system approach with government backing, they said, would make action more likely.” "},{"url":null,"title":"smiling mps remember tessa jowells","story":"NewsSmiling MPs remember Tessa Jowell\u0027s firm view on sex at the Olympics in affectionate Commons tributesPoliticians set aside their differences as they remembered the popular ex-Cabinet Minister after she died aged 70 from cancer\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor19:02, 14 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMPs smiled and laughed gently tonight as they shared their memories of “remarkable” Tessa Jowell after her death from a brain tumour. Politicians from across the parliamentary divide set aside their differences as they remembered the popular ex-Cabinet Minister, who died on the weekend aged 70. Theresa May led Commons tributes to the former Labour Culture Secretary, who played a key role in bringing the 2012 Olympics to London. MPs chuckled as the Prime Minister hailed Baroness Jowell’s sense of humour, adding: “For many years after London won that Olympic bid, the screensaver on her phone was a photo of her and David Beckham after the announcement, hugging. “As she said, you can be a feminist, but still be susceptible to a David Beckham moment.” Labour former frontbencher Yvette Cooper told MPs: “I can’t help keeping remembering a meeting before the London Olympics where she briefed us in some detail, with great frankness, on her plans to distribute condoms throughout the Olympic Village.  “She said to us, ‘There are going to be all of these athletes with their beautiful bodies and when they’ve finished their races they’re going to have a lot of sex, and we have a responsibility to keep them safe’. “With a twinkle in her eye, that was Tessa - completely down-to-earth, completely practical, had no qualms, no squeamishness about all aspects of people’s lives. “That was also what made her so remarkable.”  Labour MP Peter Kyle told of Baroness Jowell’s meeting with then PM Tony Blair over the Games.  The Hove MP said: “At the end of the meeting she turned informally to him and said, ‘Do you want to be the Prime Minister that had the Olympics within your grasp and chose to turn away?’ “That for me was Tessa because she had learned to weaponise the male ego and woe betide any big beast that stood between her and one of her political objectives.”  Labour backbencher Bary Sheerman said: “She brought fun into his place. “Sometimes we’re a bit dreary in these chambers - if Tessa walked in or was in the room it was a feeling of a bit of joy coming through the door.”  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn remembered a “warm and compassionate person”.   SNP MP Pete Wishart branded her “one of the great parliamentarians of the past 30 years”, saying she was “determined, feisty but always personable and charming”.  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt hailed her “unique” and “inspiring” gift for “bringing people together and breaking down barriers”. Mr Hunt, a former Culture Secretary, admitted he had the “terrifying responsibility” of Baroness Jowell’s Olympics dream come true.  “Faced with Tessa, I never dared put a foot wrong,” he said. Earlier, the peer’s daughter, Jess Mills, revealed her mum’s last moments were “incredibly peaceful” time, surrounded by her family. “It is the greatest honour of my life to be her daughter. The way that she was until the last moment was just so courageous and brave,” Ms Mills told the BBC. “Just the day before she had her haemorrhage, her and dad were just walking down the beloved lane that we have outside our house. “She was in the most wonderful spirits, smiling and laughing with dad and just having the most special time. We were with her every single moment. “We didn’t let her go for the whole of the last couple of days that she was very, very, very ill. “We literally laid with her, next to her, kissing her, holding her, telling her how much we loved her and it was the honour of our lives to be her family. “It was an incredibly peaceful time. Until the last moment she was the magnificent person, mother that we all know and just adore.” Dame Tessa Jowell, who has died of cancer aged 70, enjoyed a political career spanning almost 50 years that began soon before Labour entered its wilderness years. Born in London in 1947, she was brought up in Aberdeen, where her father worked at the medical school, before returning to the capital to train as a social worker. She reputedly stood as a Camden councillor in 1970 assuming she\u0027d lose - only to win and then chair the social services committee aged 25. The political bug bit her and she stood in marginal Ilford North in 1978 and 1979. But like many Labour hopefuls, she lost to a wave of support for Margaret Thatcher. It was another 13 years before she finally won the Dulwich seat in 1992, holding it for 23 years. She was one of the 101 female MPs - dubbed the \u0027Blair Babes\u0027 in less self-aware times - who coasted into Parliament on Tony Blair\u0027s 1997 landslide. And Dame Tessa was the firmest Blair ally you could ask for. She once said she\u0027d jump under a bus for the ex-PM, and held dinners with other leading female allies including Margaret Hodge and Harriet Harman.   Rewarded for her talent and loyalty, Dame Tessa had a string of frontbench jobs in health, women\u0027s rights before joining the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in 2001. It was that role that would make her. She tirelessly championed London\u0027s bid to host the Olympic games - and won it in 2005 in the face of Civil Service and Cabinet scepticism. The victory was tinged with tragedy. A day later, four men with rucksacks killed 52 people in the 7/7 London terror attacks. And later, the great recession would strike. In 2008, as the Olympics cost billions while thousands lost their jobs, Dame Tessa said: Had we known what we know now, would we have bid for the Olympics? Almost certainly not. Dame Tessa lost her Cabinet post in Gordon Brown\u0027s 2007 reshuffle, but remained Olympic minister and oversaw every stage of the games, from initial bid to competition. Ed Miliband, who was Labour leader during the games, said at the time she had left an enormous legacy and that the country owed her a debt of gratitude. Dame Tessa also served as employment minister and minister for women, and remained on Mr Miliband\u0027s frontbench in opposition before stepping down from the Commons in 2015. She was made Dame Tessa in the 2012 Birthday Honours for political and charitable services, partly for her Olympics work.   And she was a sure bet for a peerage - being made Baroness Jowell of Brixton after her retirement as an MP in 2015. She later stood to be Labour\u0027s candidate for mayor of London in 2016 but, with party feeling swinging away from the politics of Tony Blair, she lost the nomination to Sadiq Khan. Her career was not without controversy. Early on, she was forced to defend the exemption of Formula One at the time from a ban on tobacco ads. Later, as Culture Secretary, she met controversy over plans for flexible drinking hours and for Britain\u0027s first super-casino. But by far the most well-known controversy was her high-profile split from her lawyer husband David Mills in 2006. Dame Tessa admitted being unaware he had paid off part of their mortgage with \u0026pound350,000 at the centre of a bribery case involving former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Mr Mills was charged along with Mr Berlusconi with corruption in Milan and was convicted in his absence in February 2009, before being acquitted by the Italian Supreme Court under Italy\u0027s statute of limitations a year later.   The couple, who married in 1979 after Dame Tessa split from her first husband Sir Roger Jowell, parted after it was said to be damaging Dame Tessa\u0027s career, but they were later reconciled. Mr Mills accompanied her, along with their children Jess and Matthew, to Buckingham Palace when she was invested with her damehood in January 2013. The speed of her late physical decline was dramatic. On May 24 last year she had two seizures in a taxi as she made her way to a talk in east London. Two days later she was told she was suffering from a rare type of brain tumour, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). She devoted her last months to an emotional campaign for more cancer treatments to be available through the NHS, including meeting PM Theresa May who called her an inspiration. And she was trying treatments herself, wearing a \u0026pound240,000 electronic skull cap. In February her daughter, Jess Mills, said she was seriously optimistic. Dame Tessa\u0027s final legacy will be her emotional January 2018 speech in the Lords in which she called for more wide-ranging and better-funded cancer care. She received a standing ovation as she told peers: In the end, what gives a life meaning is not only how it is lived, but how it draws to a close. I hope this debate will give hope to other cancer patients like me. So that we can live well with cancer, not just be dying of it."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa cannot turn blind eye","story":"NewsopinionTheresa May cannot turn a blind eye to the bloodshed in Gaza: Mirror Politics morning briefingTheresa May is under pressure to issue a forthright condemnation of Israel for the slaughter in Gaza\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics08:47, 15 MAY 2018NewsopinionThe Prime Minister is under pressure to condemn the violence in Gaza (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Today Theresa May will host Turkey’s Recep Erdogan in Downing Street.

Robert Mugabe, Nicolae Ceaușescu and, most recently, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman have all been bestowed state visits.      But there is a growing fear the consequences of Brexit mean we will have to sacrifice more of our moral authority on the altar of economic deal-making.   We have already seen the spectacle of Liam Fox claiming Britain had “shared values” with Rodrigo Duterte, the brutal leader of the Philippines.   It is especially rich that those Brexiteers who twisted the threat of Turkey’s potential membership of the EU to win referendum are now happy to kow-tow before Erdogan on his visit to London.   Boris Johnson, who played on fears about Turkey’s during the campaign and insulted Erdogan in a lewd poem , has since suggested we can do a “new jumbo free trade deal” with the country.   Mrs May’s press conference with Erdogan this afternoon could prove uncomfortable.   Will the Prime Minister dare to challenge the Turkish President on his human rights record?   And will she join Erdogan in condemning the slaughter in Gaza?   He has accused Israel of “genocide” and said the US shared responsibility with Israel for a “vile massacre.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"devastated parents say university student","story":"News\"He seemed disconnected\": Devastated parents claim student son, 21, killed himself after online gaming obsession left him feeling \u0027isolated\u0027\u0027Sensitive\u0027 gamer Matthew Beaumont\u0027s dad said frequently playing games such as Assassin\u0027s Creed and FIFA left his son \u0027disconnected from reality\u0027 after he was found hanged in his room by a flatmate\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKevin Shoesmith08:56, 15 MAY 2018Updated09:08, 15 MAY 2018NewsMatthew\u0027s death came as a complete shock to his mum and dad (Image: Hull Daily Mail / MEN Media)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe parents of a young man who took his own life fear online gaming could have led their sensitive son to become isolated and depressed. University of Hull student Matthew Beaumont, 21, was found hanged in his room at Ashcourt student accommodation in north Hull, on November 29 last year by a flatmate.  His parents, who described him as an absolute joy to bring up, said Matthew was a big gamer and his death came as a complete shock, the Hull Daily Mail reports.  We had absolutely no idea that he was anywhere near that state of mind, said Matthew\u0027s father, Stephen Beaumont. Matthew was a big gamer. He loved playing a game called Assassin\u0027s Creed. He loved his FIFA games, too. Gaming causes isolation and disconnection from reality. That\u0027s a real problem.  An inquest into his death on Monday at Hull Coroner\u0027s Court heard Matthew had spoken to his mother, Linda, just two days before his death. She said Matthew sounded tired and frustrated on the telephone. I said, \u0027I love you Matt\u0027, and he said, \u0027I love you, too\u0027, she said. There was nothing about the phone call that made me think he was desperate. Frustrated, yes. But not desperate. Matthew was an absolute joy to bring up. He was so sensitive to how others felt. Tests after his death showed a small amount of cannabis was in Matthew\u0027s blood, and his friend told the hearing Matthew would often smoke the drug in communal areas of their flat, as well as in the shower in his room. Pathologist Dr Lorenzo Karsai gave hanging as the medical cause of death, but said cannabis could have impaired cognitive functions.

Robbie Goldsmith was so lonely during his nearly 30-year career that he hurled thousands of bottles containing notes into the ocean. Using a variety of containers that floated, the 73-year-old says he would chuck as many as 12 messages into the water every week. Each one explained where the bottle had come from, and asked the finder to let Robbie know when and where it had been found. Robbie, who lives in St Peter Port on Guernsey, spent most of his working life in the Trinity House Lighthouse Service at Hanois lighthouse.  Based a mile off the channel island, his messages floated away on tidal streams to far flung destinations including Florida, US. And one of them came into the possession of a German woman. Robbie was 50 when he received a reply from the woman, called Jutta, who was living in France at the time. The pair soon became pen pals. But over the coming months, they developed a romantic connection. One woman in France found one of my letters and wrote to me, recalled Robbie, who would spend more than a month on his own at a time. I got transferred to Alderney light house and while I was there she came over and visited me. She was divorced and I was divorced so we struck up a relationship. That was good, she was from France but she was a German lady.  I was 50 at the time, she was 42 or 43. She had auburn hair and was very good looking. It was the sort of thing I would have dreamed about as a younger man. You could say that. During a break in his casual relationship with Jutta, Robbie ended up getting engaged to a former partner. He continued: Later on when I was back on land I got married to an older girlfriend so I had to break it off. But when I got divorced 10 years later she got in touch and she came over and she spent Christmas with me but the magic had gone. I was young and handsome then, I\u0027m old and ugly now. Robbie used to spend 56 days at a time living a solitary existence in his lighthouse - maintaining the lights and keeping watch for ships.  To quell his boredom, he began throwing bottles into the sea. Over his 27 years in the job, he says he hurled thousands of bottles into the water, each containing a similar, simple message. He claims he received hundreds of replies. I just thought one day let\u0027s stick a message in a bottle and see what happens, he said. After a month I got one reply, and I thought this is a good idea. It was a good way to contact people, being on a lighthouse is quite lonely. I used to put 10 or 12 in a week, I would use any sort of bottle, plastic, glass, mustard jars, and marble tin containers, anything that floated. I’d probably get prosecuted now. The note I had written in it was quite simple.  The message read, \u0027this bottle was thrown into sea from the Hanois lighthouse, which is one mile of the south-west coast of Guernsey, if you find it please let me know when and where you found it\u0027. Although Robbie has fond memories of his time in the lighthouse service, he also experienced tragedy when his teenage son drowned. The then-lighthouse keeper was on Guernsey when the 19-year-old fisherman, Paul, got into trouble in nearby waters while alone. He drowned right by the lighthouse, said Robbie. I was ashore at the time when it happened, he was only 19. He was a fisherman and was in his boat and it sank. We don\u0027t know what happened, he was on his own so we don\u0027t know for sure. Although Robbie left the lighthouse service around 20 years ago, some of his messages are still being found.

Cliveden House Hotel, on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate in Taplow, Berkshire, boasts of its 350-year history and of hosting debaucherous parties and scandalous affairs. The American Suits star will stay with her mother Doria Ragland at the luxury accommodation, where a deluxe suite costs from \u0026pound1,195 a night. And a stay in its three-bedroom Spring Cottage, complete with Aga, is priced from \u0026pound2,055. In 1961 the hotel took centre stage in the early days of one of the most infamous scandals ever to rock British politics. It was there that then-secretary of state for war John Profumo first spotted 19-year-old Christine Keeler skinny dipping in an outdoor pool at Cliveden House.  They went on to to have an illicit affair and Profumo was forced to quit his job amid great political scandal following lurid disclosures of high-society sex parties and claims he had shared his mistress with a Soviet defence attache. The hotel\u0027s spa has in the past offered nail polishes named Scandal and Profumo. Built in 1666 by the 2nd Duke of Buckingham as a gift to his mistress, the privately owned Grade-I listed stately home is surrounded by 376 acres of National Trust grounds. Prince Harry will spend the night 15 miles away at the Dorchester Collection\u0027s Coworth Park in Ascot, with his best man and brother the Duke of Cambridge, Kensington Palace revealed.  The prince and the duke know the hotel well and play regularly on Coworth Park\u0027s world class polo grounds, managed by Guards Polo Club, and last year Ms Markle watched Harry compete. Coworth Park is owned by the Dorchester Collection hotel group, which is part of the Brunei Investment Agency, which controls some of Brunei\u0027s sovereign wealth. The hotel group faced a boycott in 2014 when the Sultan of Brunei announced a law to punish gay people with death by stoning, with Stephen Fry among those who cancelled a stay at Coworth Park. The hotel describes itself as the scenic route to five-star bliss offering an oasis of calm, so it would appear Harry could be having a sedate night before his wedding.

Thomas Markle Snr is still in North America - with Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s nuptials in the UK just five days away. He was expected to walk her down the aisle on Saturday, but last night it was claimed he no longer plans to travel to the UK to give her away after he admitted staging photos for the paparazzi.  The 73-year-old father of the bride told TMZ he\u0027s been popping Valium to ease his chest pains after suffering a heart attack, and he could return to hospital as early as Monday night.   Mr Markle told the website he suffered a heart attack six days ago and his new chest pains have been triggered by emotional upset. He also called out his oldest daughter, Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle, who has criticised the Suits actress and claimed she was to blame for the paparazzi photos that he was paid for. He added: I\u0027ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter.    He told TMZ he hasn\u0027t heard from Meghan, 36, since reports surfaced that he has decided not to attend the wedding to spare her and her 33-year-old husband-to-be from further embarrassment.  Mr Markle suggested his ex-wife, Doria Ragland, should walk the American actress down the aisle during the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle.  Mr Markle said he checked out of a charity hospital in Mexico a few days ago, but feels he needs to go to another hospital soon.  The pensioner, who lives in the Pacific coastal city of Rosarito, Mexico, fears he will suffer a third heart attack, it was claimed. Bookmaker Ladbrokes, meanwhile, are offering odds of 4.6 that Meghan\u0027s mother will walk her down the aisle. Future father-in-law Prince Charles is rated as a 2/1 chance to step in and take over the role.  Piers Morgan lashed out at Samantha Markle for being a media vulture in a furious tirade on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday. He was left fuming when Meghan\u0027s sister tried to blame the media for her father\u0027s troubles. Mr Markle allegedly sold the paparazzi snaps - showing him going to shops and fast food restaurants - for \u0026pound100,000, and admitted to TMZ that he was paid for the images. It was claimed Harry is blaming himself after Mr Markle, a former Hollywood lighting director, reportedly pulled out of the wedding.

Thomas Markle fears he will suffer another heart attack due to the emotional distress from the fallout over his deal with a paparazzi agency. The 73-year-old made the shock decision to pull out of the royal wedding on Monday after he was caught staging photographs. He is believed to have been experiencing new chest pains after suffering a heart attack six days ago.  Thomas reportedly told TMZ that the pains have been triggered by emotional upset, and specifically mentioned his oldest daughter, Samantha Grant. Samantha had a very public falling out with Meghan in the lead up to the wedding and has claimed the paparazzi stunt was her idea.  Thomas told TMZ : I\u0027ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter. Thomas pulled out of the big day on Saturday amid fears his presence at the ceremony would cause his daughter and the Royal Family major embarrassment. The news will have thrown Meghan into turmoil, her half-brother Thomas Markle Junior has said last night. A friend of Meghan and her fianc\u0026eacute, said Meghan obviously wants her dad there and she was standing by her father and pleaded for understanding, saying he was not in a good place and are begging for people to give him some space. Harry, 33, is reportedly blaming himself, with the friend telling the Daily Mail : He feels that anyone who gets associated with his life – this is the price they have to pay. Follow our latest updates on the wedding countdown here .  Kensington Palace had insisted on Sunday that Thomas would be walking Meghan down the aisle before she tied the knot with Prince Harry at Windsor Castle, despite the pictures scam. And he claimed he suffered a heart attack last Tuesday but checked himself out of the hospital for the wedding. Reports in the US said last night he did not catch the flight he was due on to London today. Son Thomas Jr, 51, told the Daily Mirror: “Meg will be frantic, she’ll want to know how he is. I’m deeply concerned about him.  As much as he was dreading all eyes being on him he will not want to cause any embarrassment or deflect attention away from Meghan and Harry’s day. “He’ll be devastated not to be going but also relieved.” A friend said: This is not what she wants. She obviously wants her dad there. And the idea of contemplating him not being there now is not something that she wants to have to do. He is clearly feeling under immense pressure. The concern for him is real and genuine. \u0027He is a proud man who wants to be a father and not be taken care of, but it\u0027s quite difficult. Everyone needs to pause and think what this is doing to them and, more importantly, to him.  The friend also said Harry was devastated at the situation, adding: He feels like this is another thing in the wake of him... the problems he causes. He wants to protect her and this is really difficult for him to swallow. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: “This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.”  Thomas had vowed to apologise to Meghan, 36, and the royals over the staged photos with US-based British photographer Jeff Rayner. The shots came after he claimed he had been harassed by snappers. Reports in America said Thomas admitted the shots, near his home in Rosarito, Mexico, look “stupid and hammy” and he “deeply regrets” the episode. The pictures included ones of him looking at internet photos of Meghan and Harry, 33, and being measured for his wedding suit.

Charlie Woodhead\u0027s commute to university is taking a lot longer than it should - and he says Manchester is one of the worst cities for accessibilities.  The 20-year-old, born with a form of albinism, is partially-sighted and uses a walking stick.   Bus drivers are expected to shout out the number and destination of their service when they see him, but many are failing to do so, the Manchester Evening News reports.  When a reporter joined him at his stop on Friday just one driver in 20 stopped and spoke to him.  Charlie, who is unable to drive, recorded video of a recent commute - from Oxford Road to Portland Street, China Town - when a number of services passed by before he finally caught a bus. First Manchester has since apologised while Stagecoach said it was striving to ensure passenger journeys were stress-free. Charlie wears sunglasses in all weather and holds a fluorescent orange bus pass indicating his disability. But he also stands in the designated blue disability area of the stop when possible - often to no avail.  Charlie, who’s studying law at Manchester politan, said: “It’s a big problem in Manchester as it is everywhere. I rarely have a good experience. “On the day I filmed my bus came within 30 seconds but I missed it because it stopped beyond the stop and the driver didn’t help me. “I ended up waiting half-an-hour. By then, four buses had passed that could have taken me home. I nearly missed a train as a result.” Sick of missing his buses, Charlie decided to record video of his journey from Portland Street to near his home on Chester Street.  And his findings - with 39 buses either passing by without stopping or failing to alert him - were shocking even to him. Of those, four were going Charlie’s way. But three - the 101, 102 or 103 - stopped short or long of the stop with no shout-out and one didn’t stop at all. A further 10 buses that weren’t going in his direction but use the same stop failed to alert Charlie. Of the total number of drivers who failed to stop or shout out, 28 were with Stagecoach, nine with First and two with Arriva. In all, four drivers - all Stagecoach - did stop and shout out the number. But none of them were his bus.

A huge swarm was spotted in Newcastle\u0027s St James’ Park on Sunday and tried their best to ruin alfresco lunches for those who wanted to make the most of Monday’s warm weather. With social media full of posts complaining about the greenfly ‘plague’, Dr Gordon Port from Newcastle University’s School of Natural Environmental Sciences explained why there are so many greenflies in the skies. It’s because of the weather  Dr Port told Chronicle Live that the light winds, warm temperatures and rapid onset of spring have combined to cause the greenfly plague.  “Every year greenfly feed on plants at the start of their life cycle, as plants come into leaf in the spring.   Swarms of bloodsucking flies that leave huge blisters and groin swelling set to cause havoc in hot weather  In most years the weather is more varied, but we’ve had a spell of really nice, warm conditions over the last week, causing the number of greenfly to go up and up. They’re mating and thinking, ‘we need to find some new food now’.” Light winds mean the greenflies are not scattering “They’re weak flies. They take off and let the wind carry them where it can and see if they can land near the right food,” Dr Port said.  And usually, this method let\u0027s them hitch a ride on the wind to find new sources of foods. However, the wind has not been very strong, so the greenflies have not blown across the country. So they are concentrated in bigger groups, all searching for food across a smaller area. Dr Port added: “In average weather conditions they get blown away quickly, but when it’s relatively still and warm, like this, we tend to notice them.” The flies you’re seeing today are sycamore aphids "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry invites afghanistan veteran","story":"NewsPrince Harry invites Afghanistan veteran and Invictus Games gold medallist to entire weddingJohn-James Chalmers, 31, will be in St George’s Chapel with wife Kornelia and they will also attend the two receptions after the ceremony\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByVictoria MurphyRoyal correspondent22:06, 14 MAY 2018Updated22:58, 14 MAY 2018NewsJohn-James Chalmers in hospital after IED blast in 2011\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email An Invictus Games gold medallist who met Prince Harry just four years ago has been invited to all three parts of his wedding day.  John-James Chalmers, 31, who suffered facial and arm injuries in an IED blast in Afghanistan in 2011, will be in St George’s Chapel with wife Kornelia and they will also attend the two receptions after the ceremony.  It will be in stark contrast to the last royal wedding , when JJ listened on a wind-up radio in Afghanistan as Prince William took his vows.  JJ, who was a Lance Corporal with the Royal Marines, met Harry in June 2014 at a rehabilitation triathlon. The prince persuaded him to enter the first Invictus Games that September and JJ won gold in a cycling event.  Since then, he has found himself gradually welcomed into Harry’s inner circle. JJ, who has a daughter, said: “I’m just happy my friend is settling down with somebody. So many of our other friends are all settled down and have kids, so he needs to catch up. “It’s fantastic to see that he’s been able to find someone, because I’ve been able to see what his life is like over the last four years and he works extremely hard, it’s very hectic.” JJ said he would be pinching himself when he is in the chapel as the world watches. He said: “I’ll be thinking about the fact that seven years previously, at the last wedding, I was listening to it on a wind-up radio in Afghanistan.

When she stepped out the carriage and walked up St Paul\u0027s Cathedral\u0027s stairs with the huge train behind her, the world was in awe of its beauty. But there was one person who wasn’t happy when she first saw the dress - the woman who designed and made it. Elizabeth Emanuel and her husband spent months creating the stunning ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown. The dress reportedly cost \u0026pound9,000 at the time, and featured puffed sleeves and more then 10,000 pearls.  Speaking during ITV\u0027s Invitation to the Royal Wedding, Elizabeth admitted being horrified when she saw how creased Diana\u0027s dress had become. She said: We did know it would crease a bit but when I saw her arrive at St Paul\u0027s and we saw the creasing I actually felt faint. I was horrified, really, because it was quite a lot of creasing.  It was a lot more than we thought. They had done a dress rehearsal but using a different material, and it wasn\u0027t anywhere near as bad. But she now says that looking back, that moment was actually her favourite shot of the Princess in the dress, comparing it to a caterpillar coming out of a cocoon and becoming a butterfly.

Val Smith avoided disaster when her clever border collie Bonnie acted on natural instincts and raced to get help.  The 75-year-old owner had got tangled up in brambles on a walk in the woods, the Plymouth Herald reports.  Val was out for the day walking in Widey Woods, Plymouth, when she took a few wrong turns, ended up on a different path and got overwhelmed by thick, gnarly shrubs. Stressed, disorientated and lost, Val didn\u0027t know what to do. And the panic set in further as she watched her eight-year-old border collie race off out of sight - while her other dog Snoopy circled in distress.  Val feared she\u0027d lost Bonnie forever. But what happened next was truly amazing. Bonnie encountered two local teachers who happened to be out walking, who sensed something was wrong as soon as they saw her. They followed Bonnie down winding paths before leading them to Val - who was astonished her beloved pet had returned - and with help in tow. Val sadly didn\u0027t grab the names of the teachers who saved her. But she\u0027s overwhelmed by what they did, not to mention astonished by the heroic actions of her dog. Val said: When my Collie vanished I thought, \u0027oh God, someone will pinch her\u0027. But then after a while I heard some voices. I tried to break away at the branches that were all tied up around me.

A 60 Minutes investigation by Nine News in Australia that aired tonight features a panel of aviation experts working to determine what brought the plane down. Since March 2014 the world has questioned how a Boeing 777 carrying 239 people vanished into thin air en route from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Most of the wreckage has never been found but now but now experts say they finally have the answers. Larry Vance, former senior investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told the Australian current affairs programme he was confident he knows what happened to the aircraft.  “I think the general public can take comfort in the fact that there is a growing consensus on the plane’s final moments,” he said. The panel believe that the man in the cockpit, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was responsible. They all agree the pilot “was killing himself” and took the plane to the most remote spot he could so it would “disappear”.  Boeing 777 pilot and instructor Simon Hardy said Captain Zaharie avoided detection of the plane by either Malaysian or Thai military radar by flying along the border, crossing in and out of each nation\u0027s airspace. Mr Hard told the programme: “As the aircraft went across Thailand and Malaysia, it runs down the border, which is wiggling underneath, meaning it\u0027s going in and out of those two countries, which is where their jurisdictions are.  “So both of the controllers aren\u0027t bothered about this mysterious aircraft. Cause it\u0027s, \u0027Oh, it\u0027s gone. It\u0027s not in our space anymore\u0027. “If you were commissioning me to do this operation and try and make a 777 disappear, I would do exactly the same thing. “As far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s very accurate flying because think it did the job and we know, as a fact, that the military did not come and intercept the aircraft.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grisly coincidence written stars one","story":"NewsGrisly coincidence or written in the stars?

Criminologists have long known that many murderers share the same personality characteristics. But do those murderers also share the same star sign? David Jester, the British author, spent two years researching the zodiac signs of some of the most prolific or notorious serial killers on both sides of the pond to find out.  Jester, whose new thriller The Clinic hits the shelves this week, found that more killers on his list were Taureans - born between April 20 and May 20 - than any other star sign.  He also discovered that April 24 and February 18 stand out as two of the days on which the most killers were born. We’ll leave it to you to decide if there really is a connection or if birthdays and star signs are just a co-incidence. But if you have a Taurean friend acting a little suspiciously…keep an eye on them. Serial killers, broken down by birthdays, are: Aquarius (born January 20 to February 18)  Aquarians don’t like broken promises. It can anger them when someone promises one thing and delivers another. They have a severe distaste for people who are boring and they are always looking for excitement. Might this explain those killers who lash out and kill for fun? Aquarian serial killers include:  Gary Ridgway (Born February 18, 1949): One of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, with a kill count that is said to be the country’s highest. Also known as the Green River Killer.  Lee Boyd Malvo (Born February 18, 1985)  David Birnie (Born February 16, 1951)  Joel Rifkin (Born January 20, 1959)  John Bodkin Adams (Born January 21, 1899)  Luis Alfredo Garavito (Born January 25, 1957): Known as “The Beast”, Garavito is one of the most prolific serial killers in history, admitting to the rare, torture and murder of nearly 150 boys and suspected of killing over 400.  Pisces (born February 19 to March 20)  Pisceans don’t like being alone and hate being criticised. They are compassionate and artistic, but the same has been said for many serial killers. So, which serial killers have the Pisces zodiac sign? Let’s take a look:  Aileen Wuornos (Born February 29, 1956): An angry woman who had many issues in her past. She killed several men, seemingly without remorse.  John Wayne Gacy (Born March 17, 1942): A killer who dressed as a clown. He certainly seemed to be artistic, but compassionate he was not.  Dennis Radar (Born March 9, 1945): A family man who got away with his crimes for many years. He was caught because of his desire to be infamous and to toy with police. Also known as BTK, or “Bind. Torture. Kill.”  Stephen Port (Born February 22, 1975)  Robert Napper (Born February 25, 1966)  Colin Ireland (Born March 16, 1954) Peter Manuel (Born March 13, 1927): A Scottish serial killer.  Doug Clark (Born March 10, 1948)  Aries (born March 21 to April 19)  They are determined and confident, but they can also be short-temper and impulsive. They are leaders who enjoy challenges and may see themselves as the strongest, best and most capable, traits that can be very useful and can lead to success in all walks of life, but ones that can also have a dark side. Arians on this list include:  Alexander Pichushkin (Born April 9, 1974): A Russian serial killer who is said to have killed as many as 60 people.  John Reginald Christie (Born April 8, 1899): An infamous serial killer who was active during the 1940s and 1950s.  Herbert Mullin (Born April 18, 1947)  Henri Desire Landru (Born April 12, 1869)  Judy Buenoana (Born April 4, 1943)  Taurus (born April 20 to May 20)  Although reliable, Taureans can also be stubborn and possessive. They don’t like anything too complicated, they despise insecurities and they don’t do well with changes. They are devoted, patient and hard-working, traits which can make for a great personality in someone who is stable and good-natured, and an evil manipulator in someone who is not.  H. H. Holmes (Born May 16, 1861): Said to be America’s first modern serial killer, Holmes created a murder castle and was almost ingenious in his unspeakable evil. An intelligent, devious man who chased money more than anything else.  Michael Ryan (Born May 18, 1960): The man behind The Hungerford Massacre. He armed himself with assault rifles and launched an attack on his sleepy, suburban community, before killing himself.  David Copeland (Born May 15, 1976): Known as the London Nail Bomber, Copeland was your average Neo-Nazi scum who made it his mission to kill and maim anyone who wasn’t as white and as crazy as he was.  Karla Homolka (Born May 4, 1970): A Canadian serial killer who raped and murdered several children along with her husband.  Albert Fish (Born May 19, 1870): One of the most well-known serial killers in the US, his nicknames included The Gray Man and Werewolf of Wysteria. A real-life Bogey Man, Fish was a child rapist and a cannibal. If this serial killer birthday matches yours, then you’re entitled to feel a little sick right now.  Levi Bellfield (Born May 17, 1968): A child killer and rapist in the United Kingdom.  Orville Lynn Majors (Born April 24 1961):  Robert Black (Born April 21, 1947): A Scottish serial killer and paedophile.  Steve Wright (Born April 24 1958): An English serial killer who raped and murdered several women.  Martha Beck (Born, May 6, 1920)  Gemini (born May 21 to June 20)  The Gemini is thought to be nervous and gentle, traits you wouldn’t expect to see in a serial killer. Far from being loners, they tend not to like being alone. They also hate being confined and don’t work well with routine, always seeking something different. Their adaptability can help them to fit into any new environment and social circle, which means they can hide any dark side better than most.  David Berkowitz (Born June 1, 1953): Also known as the Son of Sam. A loner who shot multiple people, apparently because he worshipped Satan, but mainly because he had a few screws loose.  Jeffrey Dahmer (Born May 21, 1960): The stereotypical serial killer. He was a loner, he abused animals as a child, and he performed unspeakable acts on living and dead victims.  Peter Sutcliffe (Born June 2, 1946): Better known as The Yorkshire Ripper. He killed prostitutes in 1970s England because of what was described as a “severe distaste for women”.  Richard Chase (Born May 23, 1950)  Ted Kaczynski (Born May 22, 1942): Also known as the Unabomber, an American terrorist.  Trevor Hardy (Born June 11, 1945)  Cancer (born June 21 to July 22)  Cancerians do not like it when someone criticizes them or the ones they love. They can also be very moody and tenacious. This makes them more prone to lashing out. If you believe in astrology then you might expect this to be one of the main zodiac signs for serial killers. However, we could find very few that serial killers with Cancer as a zodiac sign, none of which were particularly infamous or well known.  Robert Maudsley (Born June 26, 1953): Responsible for the death of 4 people, three of which he killed while he was in prison for the first murder.  Leo (born July 23 to August 22)  We often see serial killers as arrogant, struggling to grasp reality. They don’t like being treated like they are not the most important person in the room. Well, these are also traits that you will find associated with Leo. So, does that mean this is a zodiac sign that many serial killers have?  Myra Hindley (Born July 23, 1942): One of the most infamous female serial killers in the history of the UK.  Raymond Morris (Born August 13, 1929)  John George Haigh (Born July 24, 1909)  Anatoly Onoprienko (Born July 25, 1959): Active in Ukraine and known as Citizen O. One of the world’s worst serial killers based on the number of victims he claimed.  Virgo (born August 23 to September 22)  Many serial killers begin by torturing animals, but one of the traits of Virgo is a love of animals. However, they are also known to be rude and they dislike asking for help, believing that they can go it alone. There is a certain perfectionism associated with them as well, which is something that we often see portrayed in serial killers on the silver screen and in books. But what about real life? Is this one of the main zodiac signs of serial killers?  Ed Gein (Born August 26, 1906): A loner who the Psycho film was based on. He kept skin from his victims and used it to adorn his home and create a suit of skin.  Henry Lee Lucas (Born August 23, 1936): Convicted of around a dozen, confessed to many more, but is known to have lied about the majority of these.  Peter Tobin (Born August 27, 1946): A convicted serial killer and sex offender who was active between 1991 and 2006. He was born in Johnstone, Scotland, and was imprisoned in Edinburgh.  Rodney Alcala (Born August 23, 1943): Was convicted of killing five people in California during the 1970s.  Albert DeSalvo (Born September 3, 1931): Better known as the Boston Strangler, he is one of the better-known serial killers in the United States. Hs confession was disputed, and many believed he didn’t do it, but a DNA test performed in 2013 found that there was a 99.9% chance he did. DeSalvo escaped prison the first time and after being caught and taken to a maximum-security prison, he was murdered by another inmate.  Libra (born September 23 to October 22)  Often considered gentle and caring, with a severe distaste for violence, the Libra does not look like someone who would kill, let alone kill multiple times. So, if there was any connection between zodiac signs and serial killers then this would be a good astrological sign to research.  Fred West (Born September 29, 1941): A man who murdered alongside his wife and was known to torture and kill young girls, including his own children. One of the worst serial killers, ever.  Beverley Allitt (Born October 4, 1968)  Scorpio (born October 23 to November 21)  Seen as truthful but stubborn, Scorpios can also get very jealous. They are brave, but they can be violent, resourceful and secretive, which are traits you wouldn’t be surprised to find in serial killers.  Moses Sithole (Born November 17, 1964): A deranged serial killer, he was definitely violent and secretive.  Robert Pickton (Born October 24, 1949)  Fritz Haarman (Born October 25, 1879)  Sagittarius (born November 22 to December 21)  Sagittarians like to be free. They love to travel, see the world. But the same could be said for many killers who have done their bidding in far off corners of the globe. Their love of outdoors can make them strong and independent, while their distaste for clingy people could make them a little less compassionate and empathetic.  Dennis Nilsen (Born November 23, 1945): A British serial killer who targeted young gay men he knew no one would miss, before burning or flushing his victims.  Ted Bundy (Born November 24, 1946): A charismatic serial killer who killed many young women and then defended himself in court. He was sentenced to death for his crimes.  Rose West (Born November 29, 1953): The wife of Fred West, a woman who mirrored his sickening evil and helped him to kill young girls.  Derrick Bird (Born November 27, 1957)  Edward Kemper (Born December 18, 1948)  Ray Fernandez (Born December 17, 1914)  Capricorn (born December 22 to January 19) "},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin open europes longest","story":"NewsVladimir Putin to open Europe\u0027s longest bridge as Russia joins itself to annexed and controversial peninsula of CrimeaA massive security effort will be in place as the Russian President opens the controversial bridge\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByWill Stewart07:56, 15 MAY 2018Updated09:32, 15 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVladimir Putin will open the longest and most controversial bridge in Europe today that will connect Russia with the annexed Crimean peninsula. The Russian President will be protected by a huge security operation spearheaded by the FSB security services amid fears of attacks by Ukrainian nationalists. The leader of the Kremlin has said that the 12-mile link was a dream of the tsars and Stalin but has only happened under his rule. However, the project, which has cost a staggering \u0026pound2.75 billion has led to a wave of sanctions from the EU and US. After the inspection today, the first regular traffic will cross the Crimea Bridge at 5.30 am tomorrow.  Ukraine has slammed the construction by the “the Russian occupation forces”. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 after the toppling of pro-Moscow Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych in Kiev. The bridge spans a treacherous strait between the Black and Azov seas, and gives a key link to the Russian mainland. A rail crossing is due to be completed late next year. Putin said previously of the “mighty” bridge: This is a project that they tried to achieve back under the tsar.  “Then in the 1930s they tried to do it -- they also couldn\u0027t. And they tried later -- nothing worked out. “But we managed it. That\u0027s great.” He added it is “a unique structure not just for our country but I think that in the whole world there are few similar”. Heavy vehicles have already been driven across the bridge in preparation for Putin\u0027s arrival, although approach highways are not yet complete.  However, there is still a concern in Russia over security. Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov has warned: “We are constantly expecting provocations from Ukraine but believe me, we are highly ready to resist any attacks.”  He vowed: “The professional readiness of the FSB, police, and Russian National Guards is high. “Nothing can be excluded with this kind of power in Kiev. “They are fully dependent on Americans, they do not think about consequences for Ukraine. “At first they said that there won’t be any Crimean bridge, now they are talking some nonsense that they will block the movement on the bridge.” Ukrainian businessman Lenur Islyamov called for all cars using the bridge to be logged and sanctions imposed on each driver. “I do not know how to do it but I am convinced that if Ukraine cannot stop the movement on the bridge, at least all transport should be registered that goes from Russia to occupied Crimea. “Everyone must be located, name by name.  “They are no different from any others who are illegally cross the border between countries.” The bridge will cope with 40,000 cars a a day on four lanes between the mainland and Crimea which is a popular Russian holiday destination.

group","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United could become part of a multi-club organisation if and when a long-awaited takeover goes through this summer.Work on a deal that should see American owners take charge is at a crucial stage.And it could reach a conclusion in the next few weeks.Their identity remains under wraps, but it’s understood United could be one of as many as five clubs worldwide they take control of.How much they are willing to invest at Tannadice is also unclear, but a sum running into seven figures will be required to meet the cost of the planned squad revamp alone.Meanwhile, United chairman Mike Martin, who is set to remain at the helm under the new owners, has apologised to Arabs for failure to get back to the Premiership for a second year running.And he’s promised fans they will begin seeing the results of the “root and branch” review of the Tangerines he’s undertaken since becoming chairman in March.“Like every United fan, I am bitterly disappointed with the outcome of Friday’s game and the prospect of another year in the Championship,” he said in a statement released on Saturday.“Thank you once again for your continued support and I am truly sorry that we haven’t delivered for you this season.”Martin has given his backing to manager Csaba Laszlo and his plans to rebuild the team for next season.And he’s promised fans will see the results of his planned revamp of the off-field side of the club in the near future.“When I was appointed as chairman 10 weeks ago, I said I would undertake a root and branch review at the club and much has subsequently happened behind the scenes,” he said.“Over the next few weeks, we will gradually roll out resultant changes, starting immediately.We will improve every aspect of the club — all in an effort to bring back the United way.”The biggest change will be to the ownership but that will not necessarily mean a clear-out of the current directors.Local businessman Jimmy Fyffe joined the board back in December and has invested a considerable sum to help meet the cost of this season.He looks certain to remain a big part of the decision-making process at the new

to go elsewhere to recycle if a new location for the recycling bins can’t be found.Brian Gordon, a councillor for the North East ward, said he was “very disappointed” by the proposal.He said: “I don’t understand the logic here. I’m pretty sure that instead of reducing the fly-tipping by removing the recycling bins completely it’s only going to add to the problem.”A letter from the city council’s neighbourhood services committee informing residents of the proposed move said: “You will be aware that the recycling point serving the area was recently relocated to a site on Eriskay Drive.“Unfortunately, the incidents of fly-tipping that blighted the previous site have continued with complaints coming in to the department on a frequent basis.“Therefore, with regret, we are recommending the removal of the site but would appreciate your views and input ahead of any action taken.“Unfortunately, from discussions held at previous Mill o’ Mains Tenants and Residents Association meetings, an alternative location within the development is unavailable.”Mr Gordon said: “To my mind this is the wrong move. I appreciate that fly-tipping is a major issue.“However, surely by removing the bins we are only going to make the situation a lot worse. People will continue to fly-tip but there just won’t be any bins available for any rubbish at all.“I am asking for residents to come to the MOMTRA meeting on May 23 to give their feelings on the removal of their recycling centre.”The council has yet to respond to requests for comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/30738828_2099954330021673_4382604420967003771_n-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people community gets behind rock hunt started by local child minder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIf you\u0026#8217re wandering through Invergowrie Village and come across a painted rock squirrelled away somewhere, you\u0026#8217ve unwittingly become part of a community-wide treasure hunt.Local childminder Audra Mckay first suggested the game in March after a friend told her of a similar activity in Broughty Ferry \u0026#8211  and the idea has since taken off.The premise is simple: find or buy a small rock or stone, paint it using acrylic paint, hide it somewhere in the village and wait for someone to find it \u0026#8211 with that person taking a photo of themselves with the rock before hiding it again somewhere else.While it\u0026#8217s hard to tell just how many painted rocks are now scattered around the village, dozens of photos of excited children and adults with the rocks they\u0026#8217ve found have been posted in the Invergowrie Village Facebook group.Audra said it was great that the idea had taken off."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people dundee music teacher miss budge didnt let being blind hold her back says former pupil","story":"\t\t\t\t\tShe may have been blind, but Dundee music teacher Miss Budge didn\u0026#8217t let that hold her back.A former student, Neil Sinclair, said he had fond memories of Miss Budge when she was his teacher at Balerno Primary school in Douglas, Dundee.\u0026#8220The amazing thing about her was she was blind, her disability never held her back,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220I used to be her guide if we went to concerts, I.e at the Caird Hall.\u0026#8220I tried to contact her a few years back through Tayside House but due to the data protection act, unfortunately I could not.He said she was one of the nicest people he ever met.\u0026#8220I hope she is still alive and well and maybe if so through this could meet her again, as I was only 10 or 12 at the time around early 1970s,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220She coached me for the Leng medal.\u0026#8220I’m sure many will remember her if mentioned.He also remembered Hugh McMichael, his PE teacher at Craig High School, as a true gentleman.\u0026#8220It wouldn\u0026#8217t be right not to mention him,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220God bless, sadly he has passed away.\u0026#8220I had The pleasure of meeting up with him and his wife through work in the early 1980s,\u0026#8220He was hard as nails but installed great discipline, and through his values, had a great influence on me, having being orphaned at the age of five, had some great stories about his rugby days.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Professor-Robert-Steele-10-760x950-451x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people dundee professor named fellow of academy of medical sciences","story":"\t\t\t\t\tProfessor Bob Steele, of the University of Dundee, has been elected to join the prestigious Fellowship of the Academy of Medical Sciences.The Academy of Medical Sciences is the independent body in the UK representing the diversity of medical science.

Government is increasing last year\u0027 \u0026pound28.8 million investment to \u0026pound40.1 million in 2018-19. That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Tuesday 15 May 2018 9:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04092000/04092368.jpg","title":"Demand for tougher A82 safety measures","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCampaigners have warned that pedestrians or cyclists could die unnecessarily because there is currently only one set of traffic lights on the entire, busy stretch between the West Link and the Ness Bridge \u0026ndash at the Kenneth Street junction.Despite years of community pressure for safer crossings, a lengthy review by roads agency Transport Scotland has concluded that cosmetic change is ample.It has pinpointed several locations for more prominent road islands, road redesign and new signposts. The details were aired at a meeting with ward councillors.Inverness West SNP councillor Bill Boyd, Ballifeary Community Council chairwoman Zosia Fraser and Murdo Campbell, who owns Loanfern Guest House in Glenurquhart Road, consider the response inadequate.The agency was praised by Cllr Boyd and ward colleague Graham Ross for listening and a public consultation will follow in the next few months.But Mrs Fraser said: \u0026ldquoFrankly, are we waiting for someone to be killed or seriously injured on Glenurqhart Road?\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove seen kids trying to get across the road to the Co-op, to stock up for the day, and they\u0026rsquore taking their life in their hands to get across that road. It\u0027 a great worry. I don\u0026rsquot know how mums with small children cope with the traffic.Mr Campbell said: \u0026ldquoA cont-rolled crossing is the only way to improve safety. Glenurquhart Road is busy with very dangerous crossroads.\u0026ldquoThe new (West Link) bridge has taken a lot of traffic off the road but that\u0027 made it faster because the traffic now moves more freely. There\u0027 a greater risk of accidents.Agency representatives acknowledged that there had been one fatal accident involving a pedestrian and 14 other collisions \u0026ndash three of them \u0026ldquoserious \u0026ndash involving pedestrians or cyclists along the city stretch of A82 between 2013 and 2017.The proposed upgrades would be in Longman Road, Kenneth Street, the Tomnahurich Street-Planefield Road junction, the Glenurquhart Road-Park Ro-ad-Bishops Road junction, and at the West Link roundabout.The agency envisages \u0026ldquowidened pavements and islands to shorten the crossing distance at various locations, additional pedestrian crossing facilities at the A82 Kenneth Street-Tomnahurich Street junction signals and a shared footway and cycleway facility between Longman and Telford roundabouts.A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll present draft options to the public at an information day where we\u0026rsquoll seek their feedback.Cllr Boyd said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll keep the pressure on.Tuesday 15 May 2018 9:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04003000/04003573.jpg","title":"Help offered to Highland Council is the business","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspInverness Chamber of Commerce has offered to host a summit on the key issues.The invitation follows a rallying call for the public to \u0026ldquohelp themselves by lobbying MPs and MSPs on the council\u0027 behalf, to highlight the need for extra revenue to protect and strengthen services.The independent-led minority administration also urged anyone with novel ideas for boosting the local authority\u0027 finances to make contact.The Scottish Government disputes it, but council convener Bill Lobban insists that council funding has been \u0026ldquocut, in real terms, by 9.6 percent since 2010.Administration leaders are preparing a document for Scottish Government ministers explaining why Highland is a \u0026ldquospecial case due to its vast geography.The council has been proactive in reviewing its entire work practices through a cross-party \u0026ldquoredesign board with a mission to be more business-like. The chamber is now on board.Its chief executive Stewart Nicol said: \u0026ldquoTo do everything we can to support this new endeavour by the council, I\u0026rsquove written to council leader Margaret Davidson and offered to organise a joint symposium where our 420 members can provide ideas and feedback.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure our members will be glad to hear of this initiative from the council and of having a platform to contribute to its success.The council\u0027 latest annual accounts show annual spending of \u0026pound749 million and income of \u0026pound208 million.
