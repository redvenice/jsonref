Photograph: iStockIf you buy a plane ticket and your flight is cancelled, you are protected under European law. The airline has to either give you a refund or reroute you on a flight of your choosing. If you are overseas when the cancellation happens, the airline has to look after you until it can bring you home. And if it – rather than, for example, the weather, war or a pandemic – is to blame for the delay, then you might be able to get some compensation too.If you buy something in a shop and it breaks before you get it home, or is otherwise not fit for purpose, or not as advertised, the place you bought it has to look after you with a refund or a repair or a replacement with the bottom line being you should not be left out of pocket if it fails to live up to its side of the contract, or if it overpromises and underdelivers.But when it comes to matters of the heart, many of the protections we take for granted seem to vanish, or at least that was the experience of a reader by the name of Paula.Last summer she signed up to a matchmaking service and paid about €1,000 to go on the company’s books. And what did she get for her money? Obviously a successful relationship is not something that any agency could have promised, but she was promised that suitable introductions would be arranged between her and other agency clients.And Paula was happy enough with that. But she didn’t get her happy ever after. Or even happy for a few weeks.So, what happened to get her to that point?Well, Paula joined the dating agency last summer and paid the pretty hefty joining fee. “Once they took my money, I didn’t hear anything so I contacted them in September. They told me they were very busy so I gave them the benefit of the doubt, they then found a match a week later. I had not one thing in common with this person.”Paula says this was in spite of promises made at the outset that matches would be based on a particular set of elements to ensure a certain level of compatibility. “They claimed they put a lot of effort into the matches, which was not my experience.”More time passed and “again I heard nothing from them, so I contacted them again at the start of December. They told me they don’t contact people unless they have a match and told me to read the terms and conditions. I said one bad match in over four months isn’t a very good service.”A few days she heard back from the company to say it had a match, and Paula said okay.Then she heard the new match “was away and I would have to wait till the new year. I replied to say that wasn’t good enough and they said it had been a match, so they had fulfilled their contract.”“The company said it would ‘do me the courtesy’ of arranging another match with another man who was more polar opposite than the first one. Again I heard nothing from them and contacted them at the start of March, eight months on from when I signed up, for them to tell me they had fulfilled their contract of three introductions and it wasn’t their fault that one was unavailable.Paula says she was told that the company had “found you three matches so far, and I understand that it was not up to you that one was unavailable, but it is also not our fault as we cannot control when people are and aren’t free”.Well we had not come across this before so we contacted the the CCPC to find out what, if any, protections Paula and people like her had in circumstances like this. After all, €1,000 is a lot of money to part with without any comeback on behalf of the purchaser.ResponseThe CCPC said that under Irish law Paula had the right to expect that the service was “carried out with proper care and attention” and that the “business providing the service has the appropriate skills to do the job”.A spokeswoman for the commission said that if someone believes a service provider did not meet these standards, “for example, if they felt that the proper care and attention in finding suitable matches was not given, the consumer is entitled to go back to the business and negotiate a suitable redress option. Depending on the circumstances, this could either be a full or partial refund of the service fee or an alternative option that the consumer would be happy to accept.”The spokeswoman noted that Paula had already been in touch with the business and said that “in such circumstances, we would suggest that the consumer sends a formal written complaint to the business, outlining the difficulties they are experiencing and include the above information in relation to their statutory rights under the Sale of Goods \u0026amp Supply of Services Act. They should also clearly set out how they would like the matter to be resolved.”Unfortunately, the law does not specify what a consumer is entitled to in such cases, so it’s up to the consumer to negotiate a suitable redress option with the business directly.“We suggest referencing any specific sections in the T\u0026ampCs that may support their case for redress and outline how they would like the issue to be resolved,” the spokeswoman said.Elaine Fahy felt she had no choice but to make contact with Pricewatch over the “terrible time” her father has been having with Virgin Media. She says that despite the fact the company was unable to provide him with much by way of service over the course of the lockdowns – a time when he, like the rest of us, needed a decent way to communicate with the outside world – he kept paying his bill, and even after he moved out of his home following the death of his wife, he kept paying the bills.The last came in the form of a text from the company to him demanding a further payment.“I am a 76-year-old pensioner and recently a widower living alone and am blind in one eye,” his letter to the company started.“I now no longer live there. I lost phone and internet reception during lockdown and contacted Virgin Media – without much success. After several further phone calls, long holds, much cost and highly confusing attempts to reroute me to platforms I do not understand, I called to notify that I was leaving Virgin Media.”His letter says that he has “not been able to live in the house since then for a variety of health and other reasons. I had notified Virgin Media that I had no reception for a very long time and that I was unable to deal with such woeful customer service at such a difficult point in my life, in addition to lockdown. I have not received any bills or statements of account from Virgin Media since August 2019 but kept on paying nonetheless over the years €108 per month regularly without fail, which I regret very much, thereby accepting the disgraceful, unaccountable and non-transparent customer service of Virgin Media.”In January he received the text message looking for payment. “I am disgusted to be sent such a demand as the letter of January 21st, 2022. I am shocked also to be treated this way and will not pay any threatening letter accusing me of wrongdoing. I hereby request a refund of all services since August 2019. Please note I am hereby notifying the relevant regulator and will go on social media to expose this threatening and upsetting behaviour and failure to provide customer service. I will not be held liable for the woeful customer service of Virgin Media under any circumstances.”We contacted Virgin who immediately started looking into the matter for our reader. But in the meantime he got a letter from a debt collection agency demanding immediate payment of just less than €400.“We’ve been attempting to engage with you in an attempt to arrange payment of the outstanding amount you owe Virgin Media,” the correspondence started. “Unfortunately our attempts have been unsuccessful and so we’re considering legal action to recover the balance.“The next step involves passing your account to our solicitor for legal action. Any claim that is issued will be for the full outstanding amount in addition to any additional interest that is still to be added under the terms of your loan agreement. We’ll also seek to recover all costs, and any approved court legal costs. The result of this will be an increase in the amount which you’re required to pay.”ResponseWe contacted the company who investigated the matter and subsequently confirmed that it has been resolved “on good terms with our former customer. The account has been cleared, there are no monies owed and debt collection has been cancelled. Most importantly we have apologised for the length of time it took us to respond and correct this.“I have a query about a television that I purchased three years ago,” starts a mail from a reader called PJ.The television was bought in November 2018 and just after Christmas this year it started to malfunction. “I went to the shop where I bought the television to find out what they could do for me.“They said I did not purchase an extended warranty and there was nothing they could do for me as they only have a two-year limit on fixing problems that arise. I was looking on the consumer website and on this they said it was six-year period over which a problem could be raised. I informed them about this and was told they would get back to me. I had to go back three times and talk to three different people over a three-week period before I got an answer.”And what was the answer? He was told that “they could not do anything for me as it would cost them money to fix the problem. I was told that I could go to the small claims court and I would more than likely win the case but that is all they wouldcould do.“This seems like a lot of wasted time and more expense to me when they think they will lose the claim.”So, what PJ wants to know is if there is a six-year limit to bring a problem to their attention in which they need to fix the problem? If so, do they need to fix the problem free of charge? Who does he need to contact to get the problem resolved?Well, under EU law consumers across Europe have the right to seek redress when a good is faulty for a period of up to two years. It is better if you live in the Republic of Ireland. Under Irish law, the limitation period is actually six years.If a fault arises within the first six months of purchase, it is presumed to have existed at the time of delivery and it is up to the seller to prove otherwise or provide remedies. After six months, the consumer may be requested to show that the lack of conformity (for example, a hidden defect) already existed at the time of delivery. The seller should first offer a repair or replacement (liaising with the manufacturer if necessary) and provide this free of charge. If this is not possible or fails to correct the problem, then the consumer may request a refund.But that six years depends on multiple factors. The amount you pay for a product and the reasonable expectations as to how long it lasts are key here. If you spend €3,000 on a sofa and it falls apart after three years through no fault of your own, you can most likely seek redress under the Sale of Goods Act. Similarly, if you spend €1,000 on a smart phone that just stops working after 14 months, you can seek redress. If the digital watch you bought for a fiver in a discount store breaks after five years, 11 months and 29 days and you wander in looking for a refund, you can most likely whistle for it.So, it depends on how much PJ paid for the telly. He would not be entitled to a free repair or a replacement. And as with many products, it might end up costing more to repair the television than it is actually worth. But at the very least he should expect a significant percentage of the price of the television to be knocked off the purchase of a new television.A reader called Sinéad contacted us after dealing with a particular company took a heavy toll on her.“I have recently had a miserable experience attempting to resolve an erroneous request for payment and fixed penalty arising from the M50 eFlow toll,” her email began.“I am currently resident in the UK, and drove my GB-registered car to Ireland in October 2021 to visit my family for the first time since March 2020. In the course of my stay, I passed under the M50 electronic toll sensor three times. For each trip, my partner paid the toll online within 24 hours, as per the terms and conditions, and we thought no more about it.”That is not, obviously, where her story ends, as she made clear when she contacted us last week. “Last Saturday, I received a standard payment request from eFlow stating that I owed the toll fee for all three journeys along with an STR penalty for unpaid fees, to be paid to Euro Parking PLC, which is apparently their preferred UK debt collector.”Sinéad “naively” thought that this would be easily cleared up once she forwarded payment confirmation. “However, after four days of circular online chat ‘help’ and emails bouncing back from their only complaints point of contact, I am not so sure. I have written a formal complaint, and will make one to their governing body TII, but there are multiple tales of woe online, especially for company cars, rental vehicles and non-Irish registration plates.”She says that surely the main functions of an electronic toll system “are to accurately identify the registration number of vehicles using their service, and correctly correspond the recorded journeys and payment references. The amount of time spent trying to resolve the issue has been infuriating, but I am not inclined to pay a fine I did not incur.”ResponseWe contacted the company and received the following statement: “eFlow is aware of recent payment and service difficulties experienced by an M50 eFlow user. The user correctly paid for their eFlow journey upon completion and within the required timeframe. However, due to an isolated system error, the payment was not registered correctly which led to the user being issued a fine.“When the user queried this fine with eFlow customer service, they did not receive a satisfactory resolution or customer experience in line with our service expectations. eFlow has addressed the user’s issue and has apologised to the customer for the inconvenience caused. Customer service is a top priority for eFlow, and we are committed to continuously working and improving to benefit our service users.”Next up we have a reader called Susan who was fortunate enough to receive several gift vouchers for Christmas for various high-end restaurants and a spa hotel.She says she was “delighted with life until I tried to use them”.She tried to make restaurant bookings but was told by one place that it was fully booked for the next six months and the system had been closed for new bookings until June. She said that even then she would be lucky as the online booking system was a lottery.Then she comes to the spa hotel. “My daughter is getting married in April and was planning to do a spa break,” she writes. She says the spa hotel advertises “lovely packages” including dinner and treatments for €335 for two nights.“I have a voucher purchased in December for €500, so happy days,” she writes. Not so fast. Susan has been online in recent weeks trying to book a stay but can’t find availability.“I emailed the hotel and was told that it was best to call as they often have cancellations. So I called the hotel today and looked to book a package of some sort, even the midweek B\u0026ampB and dinner rate, but I would have preferred the spa package. The only option I was given was a date midweek in April, B\u0026ampB only at €169 per person, with no packages available until next year.”She spoke to a manager but came away from the conversation unsatisfied.“So much for me hoping in my 60th year I would get to enjoy the so-called finer things in life. Think from now on I’ll stick to my local cafes and bars. Rant over. I hope my stress levels return to normal soon as it is only a first-world problem I know, with all that’s going on, but it still upsets me.”It is an interesting issue and raises a question as to whether or not priority in bookings should be given to voucher holders who have – effectively – already paid for the hotel or restaurant. It is not something that is covered in law but, from a moral perspective, it would seem like the right thing to do. While we understand that demand for popular restaurants can be high, it surely is not beyond them to even set aside a percentage of tables when bookings open for those with vouchers to ensure no one is left feeling hard done by."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"In Richard Nairn\u0026rsquos second book on the Irish coastline, he has bad news to shareStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid cases surge 63 954 cases reported in last five days","story":"Paul Reid said it was expected that levels of the virus in the community would rise after holiday weekends.

Removing the mask requirement in congregated settings particularly with poor ventilation, is clearly having a detrimental impact in our hospitals.” She also criticised the lack of ventilation in hospital pointing out in the week beween Feburary 28th and March 6th a total of 129 Covid-19 outbreaks were detected of whom 116 were in healthcare facilities. “Air hygiene in hospitals is poor, Covid is an airborne pathogen and despite all the evidence the HSE has attached very little urgency, to the very real need for the introduction of hospital-wide air filtration and measurement systems,” she said. Speaking on Monday Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris aid: “I think it’s very clear what we’re seeing in relation to the numbers of people who are getting Covid in our country and in terms of the number of people in hospital with Covid 19… it is very clear that Covid hasn’t gone away.“This is a pandemic that we’re likely to be living with for the foreseeable future. This is a virus that we know continues to morph and evolve and the best and brightest brains in our scientific and medical community are working around the clock to try and keep ahead of it.‘Very different situation’“But we are in a very different situation. We are living in a country where people have had three vaccines and in some cases four, and we’re seeing the real benefit of that in terms of protecting people’s health and in terms of protecting people’s lives.“So I do think we’re now very much in a place where we’d have to continue to live, live our lives in a world where Covid is present. And I think we’re all very aware after two, two and half years of talking about the various things that we can all do to try and keep each other safe.“There’s no current proposal before government in that regard (mask use) to the very best of my knowledge. This is about people being vigilant in relation to their own situation.”On Sunday Tánaiste Leo Varadkar had cautioned that approximately half of those who have been admitted to hospital and have tested positive for Covid-19 have been admitted for something else. He also said Ireland was entering a second wave of the Omicron virus, but it was unlikely to see the re-imposition of restrictions. Speaking at Sunday’s national day of commemoration for those who had died from Covid-19, Mr Varadkar said while the current case numbers are “a cause for concern” they are “not a cause for panic”. “We are monitoring the situation very tightly.”He said the Government is considering whether a fourth vaccine dose needs to be started for those who are elderly or medically vulnerable. He said the expectation is that a fourth dose would be recommended to commence “around the middle of the year” rather than closer to the end of the year.The number of people in ICU remains stable throughout the second surge of Omicron. There were 49 people in ICU on Monday morning, an increase of one.Meanwhile, the HSE’s director general Paul Reid has called on the 700,000 people who are now eligible for their booster vaccination (ie their third dose in most cases) to do so.Mr Reid also urged the public to “make their own judgement” and to continue to wear masks in congregated settings, on public transport and in care home settings.There had been a “significant increase” in the last 14 days in the numbers being hospitalised. “We are still dealing with a highly transmissible virus.” A high percentage of patients were aged over 75 which led to further problems as there were fewer places in nursing homes because of Covid outbreaks.The health system was under pressure, he said.While the Omicron variant had a less severe impact, hospitals still had to implement infection controls which put pressure on spaces. Some hospitals had to cancel elective surgeries, but private hospitals were being utilised for elective care.The situation would continue to be monitored, he added. “It all revolves around bed capacity.”The higher levels of Omicron in the community had also led to increased levels of staff being absent – 4,200 last week. At the peak between 6,000 to 7,000 were not at work because of Covid. A further 900 staff at nursing homes were also absent because of the virus, he said.It was not an unusual occurrence for some people to be reinfected in March having had the virus in January, said Mr Reid. After holiday weekends it was expected that levels of the virus in the community would rise, he added and that was also likely following the longer St Patrick’s weekend.Mr Reid also encouraged parents to have their children vaccinated as only 25 percent of children aged five to 11 had received their first vaccine and only 18 percent had received their second vaccine. This was very important especially at a time when transmission levels in the community were so high. The more people who were boosted, the more protection there was for everyone.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"british and irish relationship should be based on equal respect says starmer","story":"Labour leader Keir Starmer speaks to the Labour Party Irish Society Annual St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"myanmar army committed genocide against rohingya says us","story":"Rohingya refugees walk through a shallow canal after crossing the Naf River as they flee violence in Myanmar to reach Bangladesh in Palongkhali near Ukhia in 2017. Photograph: Munir Uz ZamanAFP via Getty The United States formally determined that Myanmar’s army committed genocide and crimes against humanity in its violence against the Rohingya minority, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Monday, warning that as long as a military junta was in power nobody in the country would be safe.Announcing the decision, Mr Blinken said the attacks against Rohingya were “widespread and systematic” and that evidence pointed to a clear intent to destroy the mainly Muslim minority.The determination could bolster efforts to hold the Myanmar generals accountable and help prevent further atrocities, US officials believe. Activists welcomed the move, but called for concrete actions like tougher sanctions on the junta.In his speech at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the top American diplomat read out tragic and chilling accounts of victims, who had been shot in the head, raped and tortured.Myanmar’s armed forces launched a military operation in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh. In 2021, Myanmar’s military seized power in a coup.“Since the coup, we have seen the Burmese military use many of the same tactics. Only now the military is targeting anyone in Burma it sees as opposing or undermining its repressive rule,” Blinken said.“For those who did not realize it before the coup, the brutal violence unleashed by the military since February 2021 has made clear that no one in Burma will be safe from atrocities so long as it is in power,” he added.‘Ethnic cleansing’Days after US president Joe Biden took office, Myanmar generals led by commander in chief Min Aung Hlaing seized power on February 1st, 2021, after complaining of fraud in a November 2020 general election won by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi’s party. Election monitoring groups found no evidence of mass fraud.The armed forces crushed an uprising against their coup, killing more than 1,600 people and detaining nearly 10,000, including civilian leaders such as Suu Kyi, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group, and setting off an insurgency.Mr Blinken’s recognition comes after two earlier State Department examinations failed to produce a determination on the atrocities, which US officials had only referred to as “ethnic cleansing” until now.“There is no doubt that being allowed to get away with genocide of the Rohingya encouraged the military to think it could get away with holding a coup as well,” said Tun Khin, a Rohingya activist who heads the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK and attended Blinken’s address.“Accountability for Rohingya genocide will not just help protect the Rohingya, it will help protect all the people of Burma.”In response to the coup, the United States and Western allies sanctioned the junta and its business interests, but have been unable to persuade the generals to restore civilian rule after they received military and diplomatic support from Russia and China.Advocates say Monday’s declaration, which does not automatically unleash any punitive measures but carries political weight, could help judicial efforts worldwide to hold the junta accountable, but say more action needs to follow.Washington should work through UN bodies to push for accountability while also extending sanctions to target the foreign currency reserves Myanmar’s junta gathers from oil and gas revenues, said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.“The Myanmar military will continue to commit atrocities so long as other governments fail to impose measures to hold them accountable,” Mr Sifton said.FundingMr Blinken on Monday announced $1 million in new funding for a UN investigation on Myanmar and said the United States has shared information with Gambia connected to its case at the International Court of Justice, where it has accused Myanmar of genocide.Monday’s announcement comes after more than four years of examinations by the State Department, including a 2018 report prepared with outside lawyers that surveyed more than 1,000 Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh.Three-quarters of those surveyed had witnessed the military kill someone and more than half witnessed acts of sexual violence, Blinken said, adding the findings “demonstrate that these abuses were not isolated cases.”Mr Blinken also recalled the experience of his stepfather, Samuel Pisar, who was sent to the Nazis’ first concentration camp at Dachau a dozen years after it was built – an example of how the groundwork for genocide is laid over years or even decades.An exhibit at the museum showed how Rohingya had their rights and citizenship “methodically stripped away” over many years, Mr Blinken said. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"the russians were hunting us down they had a list of names","story":"A Ukrainian serviceman guards his position in Mariupol on Saturday. Photograph: Mstyslav ChernovAPA team of Associated Press journalists documented the agony of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol from inside the city centre when they learned their names were on a Russian list.Here, one of them tells his story of their rescue by Ukrainian soldiers as the Russian forces closed in on a hospital treating the wounded.The first-person account of the siege of Mariupol comes from Associated Press (AP) video journalist Mstyslav Chernov, as told to correspondent Lori Hinnant.He and his colleague Evgeniy Maloletka escaped the city on March 15th.And the hospital? It has been taken over by Russian soldiers.Here is Mstyslav Chernov’s account of the siege of Mariupol:“The Russians were hunting us down. They had a list of names, including ours, and they were closing in.We had been documenting the siege of the Ukrainian city by Russian troops for more than two weeks and were the only international journalists left in the city. We were reporting inside the hospital when gunmen began stalking the corridors. Surgeons gave us white scrubs to wear as camouflage.Suddenly at dawn, a dozen soldiers burst in: “Where are the journalists, for f***’s sake?”I looked at their armbands, blue for Ukraine, and tried to calculate the odds that they were Russians in disguise. I stepped forward to identify myself. “We’re here to get you out,” they said.The walls of the surgery shook from artillery and machine gun fire outside, and it seemed safer to stay inside. But the Ukrainian soldiers were under orders to take us with them.“We ran into the street, abandoning the doctors who had sheltered us, the pregnant women who had been shelled and the people who slept in the hallways because they had nowhere else to go. I felt terrible leaving them all behind.“Nine minutes, maybe 10, an eternity through roads and bombed-out apartment buildings. As shells crashed nearby, we dropped to the ground. Time was measured from one shell to the next, our bodies tense and breath held. Shockwave after shockwave jolted my chest, and my hands went cold.“We reached an entryway, and armoured cars whisked us to a darkened basement. Only then did we learn from a policeman we knew why the Ukrainians had risked the lives of soldiers to extract us from the hospital.“If they catch you, they will get you on camera and they will make you say that everything you filmed is a lie,” he said. “All your efforts and everything you have done in Mariupol will be in vain.”The officer, who had once begged us to show the world his dying city, now pleaded with us to go. He nudged us toward the thousands of battered cars preparing to leave Mariupol.It was March 15th. We had no idea if we would make it out alive.“As a teenager growing up in Ukraine in the city of Kharkiv, just 20 miles from the Russian border, I learned how to handle a gun as part of the school curriculum. It seemed pointless. Ukraine, I reasoned, was surrounded by friends.I have since covered wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh, trying to show the world the devastation first-hand. But when the Americans and then the Europeans evacuated their embassy staffs from the city of Kyiv this winter, and when I pored over maps of the Russian troop build-up just across from my home town, my only thought was, “My poor country.”In the first few days of the war, the Russians bombed the enormous Freedom Square in Kharkiv, where I had hung out until my 20s.I knew Russian forces would see the eastern port city of Mariupol as a strategic prize because of its location on the Sea of Azov. So on the evening of February 23, I headed there with my long-time colleague Evgeniy Maloletka, a Ukrainian photographer for the Associated Press, in his white Volkswagen van.On the way, we started worrying about spare tyres, and found online a man nearby willing to sell to us in the middle of the night. We explained to him and to a cashier at the all-night grocery store that we were preparing for war. They looked at us like we were crazy.We pulled into Mariupol at 3.30am. The war started an hour later.About a quarter of Mariupol’s 430,000 residents left in those first days, while they still could. But few people believed a war was coming, and by the time most realised their mistake, it was too late.One bomb at a time, the Russians cut electricity, water, food supplies and finally, crucially, the mobile phone, radio and television towers. The few other journalists in the city got out before the last connections were gone and a full blockade settled in.The absence of information in a blockade accomplishes two goals.Chaos is the first. People don’t know what’s going on, and they panic. At first I couldn’t understand why Mariupol fell apart so quickly. Now I know it was because of the lack of communication.Impunity is the second goal. With no information coming out of a city, no pictures of demolished buildings and dying children, the Russian forces could do whatever they wanted. If not for us, there would be nothing.That’s why we took such risks to be able to send the world what we saw, and that’s what made Russia angry enough to hunt us down.I have never, ever felt that breaking the silence was so important.“The deaths came fast. On February 27th, we watched as a doctor tried to save a little girl hit by shrapnel. She died.A second child died, then a third. Ambulances stopped picking up the wounded because people couldn’t call them without a signal, and they couldn’t navigate the bombed-out streets.The doctors pleaded with us to film families bringing in their own dead and wounded, and let us use their dwindling generator power for our cameras. No-one knows what’s going on in our city, they said.Shelling hit the hospital and the houses around. It shattered the windows of our van, blew a hole into its side and punctured a tyre. Sometimes we would run out to film a burning house and then run back amid the explosions.There was still one place in the city to get a steady connection, outside a looted grocery store on Buel’nykiv Avenue. Once a day, we drove there and crouched beneath the stairs to upload photos and video to the world. The stairs wouldn’t have done much to protect us, but it felt safer than being out in the open.The signal vanished by March 3rd. We tried to send our video from the seventh-floor windows of the hospital. It was from there that we saw the last shreds of the solid middle-class city of Mariupol come apart.The Port City superstore was being looted, and we headed that way through artillery and machine gunfire. Dozens of people ran and pushed shopping carts loaded with electronics, food, clothes.A shell exploded on the roof of the store, throwing me to the ground outside. I tensed, awaiting a second hit, and cursed myself a hundred times because my camera wasn’t on to record it.And there it was, another shell hitting the apartment building next to me with a terrible whoosh. I shrank behind a corner for cover.A teenager passed by rolling an office chair loaded with electronics, boxes tumbling off the sides. “My friends were there and the shell hit 10 metres from us,” he told me. “I have no idea what happened to them.”We raced back to the hospital. Within 20 minutes, the injured came in, some of them scooped into shopping carts.For several days, the only link we had to the outside world was through a satellite phone. And the only spot where that phone worked was out in the open, right next to a shell crater. I would sit down, make myself small and try to catch the connection.Everybody was asking, please tell us when the war will be over. I had no answer.Every single day, there would be a rumour that the Ukrainian army was going to come to break through the siege. But no-one came.- “By this time I had witnessed deaths at the hospital, corpses in the streets, dozens of bodies shoved into a mass grave. I had seen so much death that I was filming almost without taking it in.On March 9, twin air strikes shredded the plastic taped over our van’s windows. I saw the fireball just a heartbeat before pain pierced my inner ear, my skin, my face.We watched smoke rise from a maternity hospital. When we arrived, emergency workers were still pulling bloodied pregnant women from the ruins.Our batteries were almost out of juice, and we had no connection to send the images. Curfew was minutes away. A police officer overheard us talking about how to get news of the hospital bombing out.“This will change the course of the war,” he said. He took us to a power source and an internet connection.We had recorded so many dead people and dead children, an endless line. I didn’t understand why he thought still more deaths could change anything.In the dark, we sent the images by lining up three mobile phones with the video file split into three parts to speed the process up. It took hours, well beyond curfew. The shelling continued, but the officers assigned to escort us through the city waited patiently.Then our link to the world outside Mariupol was again severed.We went back to an empty hotel basement with an aquarium now filled with dead goldfish. In our isolation, we knew nothing about a growing Russian disinformation campaign to discredit our work.The Russian embassy in London put out two tweets calling the AP photos fake and claiming a pregnant woman was an actress. The Russian ambassador held up copies of the photos at a UN Security Council meeting and repeated lies about the attack on the maternity hospital.In the meantime, in Mariupol, we were inundated with people asking us for the latest news from the war. So many people came to me and said, please film me so my family outside the city will know I’m alive.By this time, no Ukrainian radio or TV signal was working in Mariupol. The only radio you could catch broadcast twisted Russian lies – that Ukrainians were holding Mariupol hostage, shooting at buildings, developing chemical weapons. The propaganda was so strong that some people we talked to believed it despite the evidence of their own eyes.The message was constantly repeated, in Soviet style: Mariupol is surrounded. Surrender your weapons.On March 11th, in a brief call without details, our editor asked if we could find the women who survived the maternity hospital air strike to prove their existence. I realised the footage must have been powerful enough to provoke a response from the Russian government.We found them at a hospital on the front line, some with babies and others in labour. We also learned that one woman had lost her baby and then her own life.We went up to the seventh floor to send the video from the tenuous internet link. From there, I watched as tank after tank rolled up alongside the hospital compound, each marked with the letter Z that had become the Russian emblem for the war.We were surrounded: Dozens of doctors, hundreds of patients, and us.“The Ukrainian soldiers who had been protecting the hospital had vanished. And the path to our van, with our food, water and equipment, was covered by a Russian sniper who had already struck a medic venturing outside.Hours passed in darkness, as we listened to the explosions outside. That’s when the soldiers came to get us, shouting in Ukrainian.It didn’t feel like a rescue. It felt like we were just being moved from one danger to another. By this time, nowhere in Mariupol was safe, and there was no relief. You could die at any moment.I felt amazingly grateful to the soldiers, but also numb. And ashamed that I was leaving.We crammed into a Hyundai with a family of three and pulled into a five-kilometre-long traffic jam out of the city. Around 30,000 people made it out of Mariupol that day – so many that Russian soldiers had no time to look closely into cars with windows covered with flapping bits of plastic.People were nervous. They were fighting, screaming at each other. Every minute there was an airplane or air strike. The ground shook.We crossed 15 Russian checkpoints. At each, the mother sitting in the front of our car would pray furiously, loud enough for us to hear.As we drove through them – the third, the tenth, the 15th, all manned with soldiers with heavy weapons – my hopes that Mariupol was going to survive were fading. I understood that just to reach the city, the Ukrainian army would have to break through so much ground. And it wasn’t going to happen.At sunset, we came to a bridge destroyed by the Ukrainians to stop the Russian advance. A Red Cross convoy of about 20 cars was stuck there already. We all turned off the road together into fields and back lanes.The guards at checkpoint No 15 spoke Russian in the rough accent of the Caucasus. They ordered the whole convoy to cut the headlights to conceal the arms and equipment parked on the roadside. I could barely make out the white Z painted on the vehicles.As we pulled up to the 16th checkpoint, we heard voices. Ukrainian voices. I felt an overwhelming relief. The mother in the front of the car burst into tears. We were out.We were the last journalists in Mariupol. Now there are none.We are still flooded by messages from people wanting to learn the fate of loved ones we photographed and filmed. They write to us desperately and intimately, as though we are not strangers, as though we can help them.When a Russian air strike hit a theatre where hundreds of people had taken shelter late last week, I could pinpoint exactly where we should go to learn about survivors, to hear first hand what it was like to be trapped for endless hours beneath piles of rubble. I know that building and the destroyed homes around it. I know people who are trapped underneath it.And on Sunday, Ukrainian authorities said Russia had bombed an art school with about 400 people in it in Mariupol.But we can no longer get there. – APStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"maureen dowd while putin shrinks zelenskiy soars","story":" Babushka dolls depicting Russian president Vladimir Putin  on sale in Athens, Greece. Photograph: Orestis PanagiotouEPAMyron Cohen, a garment district silk salesman turned popular comedian in the Ed Sullivan era, loved to tell this chestnut: Picture a skinny little guy, a shrimp, a nothing. He walks into a lumber camp looking for a job. The foreman is sceptical, so the shrimp steps up and fells a towering oak in 90 seconds. “Where’d you learn that?” says the foreman. “In the Sahara Forest,” replies the guy. “You mean the Sahara Desert,” the foreman corrects. “Sure, now,” the guy says. Hubris guided Vladimir Putin’s malevolent and maladroit invasion of Ukraine. As the Associated Press pointed out, US military officials assumed Russia would deploy electronic and cyber warfare to blind and paralyse Ukrainian air defences and communications. But the Russians did not take control of Ukrainian air space when they launched their attack.Putin was cocksure, dismissing Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a shrimp, a nothing. But Zelenskiy has shown the world what true stature is. Putin has always had a Napoleon complex, puffing out his bare chest on horseback fishing shirtless in Siberia winning staged judo and hockey displays. But Zelenskiy understands that stature is not about phoney macho photo shoots. Stature is a physical quality, but, more important, it is a human and moral quality. Keats was barely over 5 feet, but look at his spiritual size. Our military leaders have lately been quoting Napoleon, who said, “The moral is to the physical as three to one.” We have seen this with the Ukrainians, who are not only courageously resisting the Russians but also launching counteroffensives.Parking tanksAs the New York Times reported, the number of Russian casualties has hurt morale our intelligence reports have described Russian soldiers simply parking their tanks and wandering into the woods. Putin doesn’t realise what the world knows: You don’t show your muscularity by razing cities, by bombing a maternity hospital, a boarding school for the visually impaired, a bread line, a community centre and a shelter painted with a message in Russian pleading that children are inside. What kind of monster treats the word “CHILDREN” as an invitation to kill? This just proves that the Russian dictator is, as President Joe Biden and his secretary of state contended, a war criminal.You don’t show your power by starting a war that reveals how weak and mediocre your army is and strengthens European bonds when your goal is to ide and weaken Europe. No matter what happens in Ukraine, Putin will be a loser with no moral stature and Zelenskiy will have towering moral stature.Donald Trump, who called Putin’s barbaric strategy “genius” and “savvy” after spending four years legitimising that malefactor, also comes out a loser. Trump is stuck on the fringe of his party, sharing the wrong side of a moral ide with Tucker Carlson, JD Vance, Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump and Putin, what a pair, shrinking in stature in the eyes of the world. Tiny, tiny Trump and cruel fool Putin. The corrupt, paranoid germaphobes love surrounding themselves with sycophants, conjuring delusional worlds and giving unhinged rants.Putin let loose on those who question his misbegotten war: “Any people, and even more so the Russian people, will be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a midge that accidentally flew into their mouths. Spit out on the pavement.”He even went after his pals, the oligarchs, “who can’t do without foie gras, oysters or the so-called gender freedoms” in Miami or the French Riviera. Sowing seedsTrump and Putin sowed the seeds of their own destruction. They wanted all of the attention and credit. Now they deserve all of the blame. Grandiosity and fantasy worlds will trip up these poisonous authoritarians. Neither man has a democratic bone in his body. And both think they know better than anyone else. “When you have an autocrat who’s been in power for too long, they don’t listen to people anymore, and this war was afflicted by very bad decision making,” Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a historian who teaches at New York University, said on MSNBC. This has left Putin vulnerable and humiliated before Russian elites and the world, she said. But it has also, parlously, left him without an off-ramp “because autocrats don’t negotiate”.Stephen Kotkin, a professor of history and international affairs at Princeton, told the New Yorker’s David Remnick that the Russians have a fractured identity. Culturally and scientifically, they are a world-class power. But economically and politically, they have a hard time matching the West, so “they resort to coercion”.“The worst part of this dynamic in Russian history is the conflation of the Russian state with some personal ruler,” Kotkin said. “Instead of getting the strong state that they want to manage the gulf with the West, they instead get a personalist regime. They get a dictatorship, which usually becomes a despotism.”Zelenskiy spoke to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, comparing the terror in Ukrainian skies to the death hailed down from the skies on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and on New York and Washington on 911. He also showed a devastating video that brought tears to lawmakers’ eyes.Underlining his role as David to Putin’s Goliath, Zelenskiy said, “Strong doesn’t mean big.” Strong means supporting human rights and freedom and demanding the right to die when “your time comes and not when it’s wanted by someone else, by your neighbour”. – This article originally appeared in The New York TimesFull coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"gangs apes use slang study finds vocabulary not fixed fluid","story":"Small gangs of apes pick up slang terms which embed themselves into their vocabulary, a new study has found.Roughly 70 orangutans living in six different social groups in Borneo and Sumatra were studied by researchers at the University of Warwick, and their vocalisations recorded.Some of the groups were very sociable, regularly interacting with one another in close proximity, while others were more laid back and spread out.In the high-density groups, scientists identified a large number of original calls, with iniduals using novel sounds that are rapidly picked up, but just as quickly discarded, much like school children going through fads where certain phrases suddenly become popular before just as quickly becoming grossly uncool.But in the smaller, more relaxed groups of apes, the animals use more traditional calls and are less prone to experimenting with new sounds.However, if a new call is introduced, it is more likely to stick around and become part of the permanent primate vernacular.“Orangutans living in low densities have indeed a rich ‘slang’, that is, a collection of calls that they recurrently use and gradually build upon,” study author Dr Adriano Lameira, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Warwick, told The .“Whereas vocal communication by orangutans in high densities is like a cacophony. In these populations, it seems that novelty is at a premium.”The research, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, is the first to show the vocabulary of apes is not fixed, but is fluid and subject to ongoing group dynamics.“Our study shows that an inidual\u0027s social community moulds how that inidual communicates, as is the case with any human learning a language,” Dr Lameira said.“What was unknown was that these vocabularies differ or vary according to the type of social community an orangutan lives in.“This disproves the long-standing idea that great apes have automatic, hard-wired, reflexive and immutable calls all their lives.”More from News Russia-Ukraine latest news: Russian troops open fire on protesters in occupied city of Kherson‘This should have happened six years ago’: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe questions the five foreign secretaries it took to free herSir David Amess murder suspect plotted to assassinate Michael Gove while out jogging, court toldPoland described as ‘most evil, vulgar and shrill critic of Russia’ in thinly veiled threatEco-protesters accused of \u0026#39terrorism\u0026#39 after emptying six million baguettes\u0026#39 worth of wheat from wrong trainRed tape delays arrival of Ukrainian child refugees in the UKMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"take military spending treasurys hands","story":"Across Europe, leaders facing grim economic headwinds are meeting the threat posed by Putin’s Russia head on. In Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, Romania, Sweden and France, leaders have responded to the invasion of Ukraine by pledging to increase defence spending. There is however one notable exception: here in Britain the Chancellor is signalling that no such increase will occur. The Armed Forces will instead proceed with planned cuts to their headcount.The Government argues that the decrease in manpower will be compensated by increased spending on equipment, allowing us to do more with fewer people. But the procurement programmes central to this vision are already running badly behind schedule, and last year’s cash uplift to the defence budget is being eroded by spiralling inflation. Under these circumstances, a further boost to spending as Nato seeks to bolster its eastern flank ought to be a relatively easy decision.This analysis reckons without the Treasury. As keeper of the Government purse the department holds enormous power, which it exercises in line with its own objectives. The central pillars of the Treasury View are that deficits should be kept low, that it is better to dismantle state capacity than to borrow or tax, and that the present takes priority over the future. It is this mindset that leads ministers to scrap the electrification of railways in dire need of improvement, to insist on selling the UK’s vaccine manufacturing centre to recoup costs, and on flogging historic embassy buildings to pay for solar panels.Taken to its logical conclusion, the Treasury View can become almost anti-prosperity. It too easily forgets that the bedrock of Britain’s prosperity is its security, and the security of Europe as a whole. Refusing to raise defence spending may improve the Treasury’s balance sheet in the short term, but this is somewhat moot if our national wealth is then expropriated by the Golden Horde’s tax collectors.Treasury officials may point to headline figures showing Britain consistently meeting its Nato commitment of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, or to the MoD’s failed procurement. But this has been met by an accounting trick shifting pensions into the calculation, and it is possible to simultaneously make improvements to procurement while also acknowledging a need to spend more to make up for past mistakes.Predictable and sufficient defence spending should not be at the mercy of short-term fluctuations in the fiscal outlook or immediate electoral concerns. Austerity has already left a significant dent in British capabilities, while the long-term expansion of the welfare state was paid for by cuts to defence.The best way of securing a long-term perspective on the nation\u0027s security is to take the budget out of the Treasury’s hands. Legislative commitments, made years in advance – whether that be via meeting a percentage of GDP or maintaining specific capabilities – would short-circuit political objections to necessary spending.If, instead, the Treasury gets its way, Britain may be in for an unpleasant shock. We are used to seeing ourselves as an international defence leader, better equipped and more capable than our European neighbours. A transition to just another military would be a bitter pill to swallow for a state that has quietly used its military influence to great effect in European affairs. More from News Russia-Ukraine latest news: Russian troops open fire on protesters in occupied city of Kherson‘This should have happened six years ago’: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe questions the five foreign secretaries it took to free herSir David Amess murder suspect plotted to assassinate Michael Gove while out jogging, court toldPoland described as ‘most evil, vulgar and shrill critic of Russia’ in thinly veiled threatEco-protesters accused of \u0026#39terrorism\u0026#39 after emptying six million baguettes\u0026#39 worth of wheat from wrong trainRed tape delays arrival of Ukrainian child refugees in the UKMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"zaghari ratcliffes sat hand in hand cameras divided one crucial","story":"If you glanced at Richard and Nazanin, hand-in-hand, surrounded by cameras, and had to guess which one had been kidnapped by the Iranians for six years, you might get it wrong.He looked exhausted (a hunger strike will do that to you). She looked beautiful and poised. They glanced at each other constantly, as if to be sure the other was really there, and when she couldn’t answer a question, because the memory was too awful, she whispered “sorry”.“It doesn’t matter,” he replied.In an ideal world it really wouldn’t: the Zaghari-Ratcliffes would be left alone to rebuild their lives. But the Government spent almost £400 million to bring Nazanin home, and politics is in play – hence Tulip Siddiq, the local MP, clung to her constituent almost as proudly as Richard did, giving every impression that she’d swung into Tehran like Indiana Jones and rescued her herself. As for the journalists, we wanted to know what she thought of the UK Government, Boris in particular, which was where husband and wife parted company.“I don’t really agree with him on that level,” said Nazanin. It must be nice to be in a country where you can publicly contradict the Government and your husband in the same breath.The word “ungrateful” trended on Twitter after the press conference, which is ridiculous. Nazanin has been imprisoned for six years, unable to see her daughter for two, and the woman is in trauma – with a “black hole” in her heart. Her questions were fair. Why did it take so long to pay this ancient debt to the Iranians? Why did it take five foreign secretaries? The answer might be that not all of them were very good, that it takes on average three ministers to change a light bulb (one to stick it in, two to turn him around), and the turnover can be explained by having had so many changes of government in that time – a handicap Iran hasn’t had to deal with since 1979.The Iranians are “tricksy”, said Richard, though ruder words come to mind. When GB News asked if it was wise to pay off blackmailers, he acknowledged that the move posed a “moral hazard” – but then he can afford to be philosophical because, as he admitted, this was his “retirement day” from activism. Nazanin, one imagines, will be imprisoned permanently by memory, a private agony we cannot imagine and have no right to try.As for the future, Nazanin said her daughter told her: “You are very famous, and then it’s me and then it’s daddy.” It’s not good to be famous, mummy warned her. “Oh you’re not going to be famous forever,” said the little girl: “Maximum, a week.”That’s seven days of questions, including: can she imagine returning to Iran at some point? “It took me six years to get back,” she replied with a smile. “So I think I would be very cautious about booking a ticket.”More from News‘This should have happened six years ago’: Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe questions the five foreign secretaries it took to free herSir David Amess murder suspect plotted to assassinate Michael Gove while out jogging, court toldPoland described as ‘most evil, vulgar and shrill critic of Russia’ in thinly veiled threatEco-protesters accused of \u0026#39terrorism\u0026#39 after emptying six million baguettes\u0026#39 worth of wheat from wrong train Russia-Ukraine latest news: Russian troops open fire on protesters in occupied city of KhersonRed tape delays arrival of Ukrainian child refugees in the UKMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer says england should","story":"Keir Starmer says England should make it illegal for parents to smack their childrenThe Labour leader and former Director of Public Prosecutions spoke out after Wales and Scotland brought in a legal smacking ban, ending the previous defence of reasonable punishmentI would like to see the rest of the UK step into line here, said Keir Starmer Image: PAByGeraldine ScottBronwen WeatherbyDan Bloom:,  Mar |commentsKeir Starmer today called for England to outlaw the smacking of children. Wales today made it illegal for parents to hit kids, meaning any type of corporal punishment - including smacking, slapping and shaking, has been made illegal. Scotland had already brought brought in a ban in November . But parents in England and Northern Ireland still have a defence of “reasonable punishment” , for example, they do not leave a red mark or use an implement like a cane or belt. Critics of Wales’ law change have said it will criminalise parents, but the Welsh Government has insisted the move is about protecting childrenaposs rights. And today Sir Keir - a former Director of Public Prosecutions - called for other areas to follow suit. Speaking on a visit to Stevenage, Sir Keir said the move was welcome.  What it does is give children the protection that adults already have, and that is the right thing, he told reporters.I would like to see the rest of the UK step into line here, because I think, well, Welsh Labour have taken a lead here and theyaposre absolutely right to protect children in the way that they now have.In England and Northern Ireland smacking is unlawful, but such an assault is allowed as long as it constitutes reasonable punishment. Whether the defence is accepted depends on the circumstances of each case. It takes into consideration factors such as the age of the child and the nature of the contact, including whether it left a red mark or was carried out with a fist or implement such as a cane or belt. Wales’ smacking ban, as it is known, was brought in under the Children Act . It means children will get the same protection from assault as adults, and the law will apply to everyone, even those visiting Wales - as is the case with all Welsh laws.  Parents or anyone who is responsible for a child while the parents are absent can now face criminal or civil chargesthey are found to have physically disciplined a young person in any way. Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford said: The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it clear that children have the right to be protected from harm and from being hurt and this includes physical punishment. That right is now enshrined in Welsh law. No more grey areas. No more aposdefence of reasonable punishmentapos. That is all in the past. He added: There is no place for physical punishment in a modern Wales. Deputy minister for social services Julie Morgan called the day a historic moment for children and their rights in Wales. Viv Laing, from NSPCC Cymru Wales, said: Until now, children were the only group in our society who it was acceptable to strike in certain circumstances. We donapost allow the physical punishment of adults or animals, so it is absurd that we have for so long with children. NSPCC Cymru Wales has long been clear on this, and now, at last, the law is too. Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners Wales, Dr Rowena Christmas, said: The evidence is absolutely compelling that physically punishing a child can be harmful to the wellbeing of both child and parent. It offers no benefit that cannot be gained from another method of discipline but is associated with a broad range of harms that can last a letime. Stephen Thomas, headteacher of Ysgol y Bryn Llanelli, said: Physical punishment has no place in raising children. Providing consistency, good routines and being role models for our children in the values we would like them to display creates good people.

Crowds chanted no to PO and shame on you as Labour MPs made speeches Image: REUTERSByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsA former PO Ferriesapos nightsht worker has recalled the moment he realised he had lost his job - a security guard woke him up and urged him to “pack up and get off” the ship. The engineer, from Dover, said he slept through the infamous Zoom call as he had been on a long sht overnight. Having worked at the company for three years, he told the Mirror there were no signs that the mass sacking was set to take place. “It was crazy, there was so much confusion with all the security guards coming”, the engineer told the Mirror. “They had handcuffs and were positioned all around the ship to prevent us from taking things, or clearly just in case people got angry and refused to leave.”  The engineer claimed the company had promised to help staff move their belongings from the ship as they live on sea for half of the year. “But they didn’t, they just left us”, he claimed. He was one of dozens sacked PO Ferries staff who marched on Parliament this afternoon to express their anger and disgust at how they were treated. Last Thursday PO made a shock announcement, telling staff via video message that they were being replaced immediately by cheaper agency crew. A senior officer, also at the protest, claims he got a text at .am on Thursday morning that there was “bad news”, and he was urged to watch the Zoom call at .. “It came completely out of the blue”, he told the Mirror.“They were ordering unorm for us earlier in the week. The night before we completed a normal handover, and seniors even told me ‘see you next week’. “I’m not sure what I will do. I’ve worked with PO for  years. It was the first job I got once I finished school.” Labour MPs including Angela Rayner, Barry Gardiner, Jonathan Reynolds, Karl Turner, Zarah Sultana showed solidarity with the protestors outside the Commons. Ms Rayner told the crowd: “My message to PO is quite simple you said you needed to save money, well look what it’s done to your company now, look what people think of your company now!  “And any other company that thinks they can do something like this, I say to them, we’ll come for your next. This has to stop now.” Hull East MP Karl Turner condemned PO as a “disgusting, stinking, capitalist, predatory company”, and said he had spoken with devastated former workers including a man who was  months from retirement when he was sacked.Mr Turner said: “ had the chance in the past and they’ve let the side down. It’s no goodGrant Shapps coming out now with his crocodile tears. He could do something to act today.“A man I spoke to started as a deckhand at  years of age, he’s a first mate now. He’s got  months before he retires.crying like a baby to me about the disgust and the fact that he felt so betrayed by this disgusting, stinking, capitalist, predatory company.” In a message to the Government, Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC said: “PO want to rob their livelihoods. If you let them get away with this, then every worker will believe that they are coming after us next. “Loyal hardworking workers were being escorted off ferries by guards. We are not going to let them get away with it.”  Ms O’Grady urged the gathering not to taken their anger out on the replacement crew who are being paid £., according to unions, saying: “Migrant workers are not the enemies. Bad bosses are.” Mum-of-three Heather, , expressed her disappointment at PO’s behaviour because she has struggled to get a job as a master marina because of childcare and maternity leave. Mum-of-three Heather said PO had been one of the few companies to offer family-friendly hours.  “It’s hard working at sea as a woman”, she told the Mirror, “Iaposm gutted for all of my former colleagues who have lost their jobs and I’m here at this protest in full support of them. “I’m also gutted because PO were one of the only companies,not the only company, that I knew that did job shares and enabled a mother like myself to work on a family friendly sht pattern.” Heather used to work part time at PO until she had her last child.

And she claimed Vladimir Putin could exploit refugee flows to send agents to Britain.In her keynote speech, she said: Iaposve been asked why couldnapost we suspend security checks on people escaping Putinaposs war  Times of conflict, my friends, emphasises our need to remain watchful. I know from the briefings I receive from the intelligence and security services that instability around the world brings with it greater threats.  Only four years ago the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil. She went on: The truth is that a very small number of people can wreak utter havoc. Russia has a history of covert hostile activity.And Iaposm afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives, or that refugee flows could not be subject to some form of exploitation.  Ms Patel went on: There are those who would come to our country, to this country, who mean us harm and who plot to strike at our very way of le. The processes that we have put in place closely follow the advice of our intelligence and security services. They mean we can help Ukrainians in need without making our country less safe. It comes as the Home Office said , visas had been granted under the family scheme for Ukrainians fleeing the war by pm on Friday. Ms Patel added: State threats and terrorism take many forms. They also thrive on indference and appeasement and now we are seeing them bolstered by new types of targeted biological, chemical, cyber warfare, ransomware and online threats. Our duty is to safeguard our countryaposs interests and we will never take our eye off the ball when it comes to the safety and security of our country. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said , places had been created in schools for children fleeing Ukraine and virtual lessons created during the coronavirus pandemic had been translated into Ukrainian. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove confirmed more than , households had now offered to house Ukrainian refugees, the majority of whom have made their way to Poland.

And then he wonapost. What heaposll do instead is slice a few pennies off fuel, and while you might think this is a dandy idea all it does is reduce the governmentaposs cut, and leaves the profits to oil companies who may, or may not, decide to lower the price you pay at the pumps.By cutting the cost of petrol and diesel, Rishi Sunak will take money out of the NHS, road repairs, schools, bin collections, social work, home help, and a thousand other things you donapost notice as much as the cost of a full tank, but need in order to survive, just the same.The fact heaposll do it while telling you heaposs making le easier for the average man on the street is a flat lie from someone who is at no risk of ever having to choose between filling up on fuel, or food. Itaposs classic Torynomics - the maths of keeping rich people rich, as opposed to making the poor better off.But what more could he do, the backbenchers cry. Vladimir Putinaposs put up the price of oil and gas, the pandemic has caused supply chain problems, and working from home has pinched the economies of our cities. Weaposve lost £bn of trade since Brexit, there are traumatised Ukrainians and Afghan translators to accommodate, weaposre full, weaposre broke, weaposre buggered. Plus, it isnapost easy, being green! There are some quite cheap and easy ways that he COULD put some money in your pocket, though. And heaposs not going to bother with any of them.. Insulate every home in the UK The quickest way of saving money on energy bills is to insulate your home. The rate of doing this has stalled, and while not everyone wants or can afford full net-zero compliance of the sort which Insulate Britain crackpots demand, it is possible for lots of us to do better -we had help. Cutting % VAT on insulation of any sort, plus the same for adding solar , wind turbines, or heat pumps, would make a big dference. Heaposs not going to, because itaposs not sexy, and why should you lot get something for less. . Windfall tax on the energy firmsShell is on track to post a £.bn profit this year, while BP is likely to make £.bn. Oil firms are taxed high already - %, compared to most companiesapos % - but letaposs face it, theyaposre at no risk of the workhouse. And it would produce a massive, immediate, undodgeable payday for government which could use it to bring down bills. He wonapost, for fear that it sets a precedent, which was the opposite of his reasoning when he said heaposd have to raise taxes because of the pandemic.. Raise the NI thresholdNext month everyone with a job, and every firm, will be paying more for the privilege. The .% hike Rishi will talk about is more accurately described as % - because NI contributions will be going up by about a tenth, from % to .%. Itaposs expected to raise £bn a year for the next  years, and will be given to the NHS to repair pandemic damage.But heaposs also asking the NHS to save £.bn in waste. If you think the NHS is currently wasteful, itaposs not clear how throwing another £.bn at it will help. If you think the NHS is underfunded, giving it billions with one hand and taking billions with the other also wonapost help. So whataposs happening is youaposre getting taxed % more for something thataposs not helpful, in any scenario. In any event, it should not be paid by the poorest. Raising the threshold at which you start paying from £, to the same as the income tax floor of £, would be fairer - and he wonapost do it because it effectively creates a tax-free basic income for everyone in work. It would mean less poverty, less disease, better nutrition, better health, and in the years to come lower costs for the NHS and social care, but why should the bleeding obvious matter a jot   . Make Brexit betterThe UK waved goodbye to £bn of cross-border trade with Boris Johnsonaposs bad Brexit deal this year, at just the time the effects were worse thanks to the pandemic and, now, the war crime spree in Ukraine. Thereaposs a simple way to restore every penny of it, though, which is to end all tarfs and customs checks by complying with EU standards on goods and services.It turns out, they werenapost so bad after all. And there is not a human in the world who wants to fill in  pages of customs declarationsthere is an option to not do so. This wonapost happen either, because it would involve a government built on hoods and ignorance admitting publicly that it doesnapost know the first damned thing about what itaposs doing, which would make Rishi look like the best economist while stood in a field of financial morons. Read more . Resign The worst Chancellors in British history are the ones who presided over growing poverty because they did not know what it felt like. They never went hungry, never shivered, never missed out because they could not afford to exploit an opportunity. The better ones did experience that, and knew the price paid for being poor - they knew that it led to sickness, squalor, worse workers, lower tax takes, public health problems and generational, national failure. They could see how hungry children led to lower GDP, and wanted to fix it.Little Rishi argued that feeding children was too expensive. He said helping the self-employed was too dficult, unless they were able to provide some PPE and had a Toryaposs phone number, in which case he happily threw billions at them, no questions asked. He didnapost have a problem giving visas to rich Russians, and now the government heaposs part of is rationing the welcome mat for poor Ukrainians.

It would mean pensioners get a bumper rise next year after cuts this year in a benefits rollercoasterTherese Coffey insisted the triple lock will be brought back in   Image: Barcroft Media via Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar |commentsPensions could rise by more than % next April after the DWP insisted it “remains committed” to bringing back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation.Officials said welfare chief Therese Coffey plans to keep a pledge to base April ’s state pension rise on average wages, .%, or this September’s CPI inflation figure - whichever is highest. That will likely see a bumper rise for pensioners next Spring - but only after a year of hefty real-terms cuts. The Resolution Foundation has predicted inflation could hit .% this September, higher than last year though still below a peak next month of .%. That would lead to a pensions rise of more than £ a week in April . But the think tank blasted the “rollercoaster ride” for the benefits system and urged ministers to ease pressure now. The announcement came in a hasty clarication from the DWP, hours after the Work and Pensions Secretary publicly failed to guarantee the triple lock’s future. The DWPaposs clarication was not a full-blown guarantee and left room for a U-turn later on. But sources insisted Ms Coffey was fully planning on bringing back the triple lock in  .  Ms Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said. With inflation soaring, Mr Asworth today demanded she rule out breaking the triple lock again in   during a House of Commons debate. The DWP chief did not do so, leading Mr Ashworth to blast: “Thérèse Coffey has just refused to guarantee she won’t break the triple lock for a second year in a row. “Pensioner poverty is up, bills are up, and pensioners are facing a real terms cut to the state pension of over £ this year. The Conservatives are failing to give them the security they deserve in retirement. “The simple truth is pensioners simply can’t trust the Tories.” Hours later, the DWP issued a clarication saying Ms Coffey “remains committed” to the triple lock in  .  A DWP spokesperson said: “We temporarily suspended the earnings element - not CPI - of the Triple Lock for one year only, following distortions to the earnings statistics. “The government remains committed to implementing the Triple Lock in the usual way for the remainder of the Parliament. No said it “can’t predict” inflation in future but insisted there was “no change” to the commitment.Askedthe previous promise to bring back the triple lock for   still stood, Boris Johnson ’s official spokesman added: “It does.“We’ve made clear it was a temporary pause. “I can’t and no one can predict what inflationary pressure will be, but certainly there’s no change to the commitment we have made.” Labour warned MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis was right to say people will either starve or freeze from the cost of living crisis. National Insurance, energy bills and inflation are soaring while tax thresholds are frozen and benefits, pensions and public sector wages all see real-terms cuts next month. Ms Coffey replied: We still have the Household Support Fund, which is available to people to apply to get extra support from their local councils. “I would encourage people who are struggling right now to try and make that approach to their council as quickly as possible. But shadow DWP minister Matt Rodda said ministers don’t have “even a shred of understanding of the dreadful cost of living crisis facing pensioners. He said: “Pensioners who have worked hard and paid in all their lives face an absolutely enormous increase in the cost of living - food prices are up, the cost of heating is going up and the cost of living as a whole is going up.This huge increase in inflation was clear before the invasion of Ukraine and itaposs crystal clear now, yet so far the Government has only come up with a buy now pay later scheme for heating bills.”Work and pensions minister Guy Opperman replied: We raised the state pension by .% this year when we didnapost need to do so and itaposs going up by .% in April, on top of which there is the support from the Chancellor, the £ billion scheme set out only a few weeks ago.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsConservative PartyNational Insurance Company Ltd.Martin LewisBoris JohnsonJonathan AshworthEnergy billsState pensionPoliticsInflation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The British Medical Association also said “realistically every GP practice should close its patient list” due to unsafe patient numbers.The comments came at the launch of a joint campaign with ex-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt calling on Boris Johnson to tackle the crisis in general practice.Mr Hunt, a former sworn enemy of the BMA, said we are seeing the “Uber-isation of general practice” with patients forced to see a dferent doctor every time. Lack of GPs means that on average each is seeing  patients a day. The previous safe maximum was . Dr Kieran Sharrock, BMA committee deputy chair GP Committee England, BMA, said: “Your practice may soon no longer exist. On current trajectory your local surgery may have to close.  “In the last eight years over  practices have closed. Two and half million patients have lost access to their family doctor.“If the Government doesn’t act now every family who relies on the NHS will find basic healthcare under threat.”Mr Hunt, the BMA and the GPDF, which represents local medical committees, yesterday launched the “rebuild general practice” campaign. Mr Hunt said the GP workforce shortage had meant an end to “continuity of care” - where a patient sees the same GP. At a media briefing in Marylebone, central London, he said: “The best thing about the NHS is having your own family doctor. “We know from studies that there’s a % less chance of a patient going to hospital and a % less chance of a patient dyingthey have the same GP over a long period of time.  “And that is because it is fundamentally safer to make a diagnosisyou know a patient’s context, you know their family, their social situation. You’re more likely to see those red flags when you should. “What I’m afraid we’re moving towards is the Uberisation of general practice where you see a dferent GP every time.” He joked he was “surprised” to be sitting on the same  as BMA members after being embroiled in a bitter row with the union over new contracts for junior doctors in . Mr Hunt acknowledged he failed to increase GP numbers by , as promised by the Tories during his stint as health secretary from  to . He said: “I didn’t fail to recruit enough GPs. I failed to recruit enough to make up for those that were leaving the profession”. Dr Sharrock said the main issue was stopping GPs leaving the profession, adding: “I speak to colleagues day in day out who have gone part time. “They say its because the job isn’t do-able. It isn’t safe. They don’t want to sully their career by not safely caring their patients. So they’re getting out.  “There are processes where practices going through a short term problem can close their lists for a period of time. “But realistically every practice should close its list because we can’t take the workload we are already doing. “If the pressure on GPs continues so they think it is unsafe, it can take one or two of them to leave and suddenly you can’t run the practice. “We have a contract with the NHS and at any point we can gave three months notice and say ‘actually we can’t run this contract any more.” The Rebuild General Practice campaign has released polling from , British GPs which found that nearly nine in  fear patients are not always safe at their surgeries.Asked about the survey on Times Radio, current Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “We’re investing more in NHS workforce than ever before in history, and just in the last year there’s some , more people working for the NHS - that includes around , more doctors.“And we have more doctors in training at medical school than any other time in history.” In  the Tories promised , new GPs by .

After the experts at her local branch in Midsomer Norton noticed a strange shadow in her scan in January, she was sent to Bristol Eye Hospital where she was told she had ocular melanoma - an eye cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells.The -year-old started radiotherapy last month at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and willin August for scans which will revealsheaposs in the all-clear.But the full-time-mum has since lost her vision in her left eye and claims that simple everyday tasks, like doing her make-up, have been made far trickier since having the treatment. Now two weeks post-procedure, Karly is hopeful that her vision will eventually improve and is keen to raise awareness of the importance of having routine eye tests given her tumour was spotted in the aposnick of timeapos. Specsavers optometrist Kaye Bradley said that itaposs aposvitalapos to see an optometristyou have any changes in your vision and that the Optical Coherence Tomography scan can help diagnose many eye conditions, as well as help make urgent hospitals when necessary.Karly, of Radstock, Somerset, said: Having that eye test pretty much saved my le. You have an eye test every couple of years andIaposd left it andit was ocular melanoma because theyaposve treated it as that because it was too small to biopsy and it was presenting as that, it would have spread to my liver. I just want people to be aware to get their eyes tested because itaposs really important. Make sure that when you go and get your eyes tested, that you have that extra test becauseI didnapost have it, then I wouldnapost have even known and it would have been a lot worse because I would have lost my eye. I definitely caught it just in the nick of time and they told me I was lucky because usually people my age donapost get it, itaposs usually  and over. Karly, who has been wearing glasses since the age of three, has routine eye tests and had the Optical Coherence Tomography scan during her appointment last month.  She said: They offered me the extra health eye check and I went with it. She brought up the pictures on the screen and at first we thought it was just a shadow. It wasnapost until we looked at it closely and she was like aposoh, itaposs not a shadowapos she wasnapost too sure what it was and she was really concerned so she said the best thing for me to do was to go to Bristol Eye Hospital. I went and had loads of dferent eye tests and they sent me up for a CT scan and said that they thought I had ocular melanoma. But at this point, I didnapost know what it was. Then he started talking about radiotherapy and when he said aposradiotherapyapos I thought aposoh, thataposs cancerapos. The mum was then referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust where she stayed for three days to have her radioactive plaque treatment.  During the procedure a small metal disc was placed onto the surface of her eyeball over her tumour which gives out radioactive energy, with most of it directed inwards towards the tumour. Karly said: At first, it [receiving diagnosis] didnapost really click. The impact of it hasnapost really hit me until now I canapost see, now itaposs more upsetting for me because I canapost see anything. My vision is so blurry now, I canapost see out of my eye at all. If I look to the left itaposs just black. They did say that my eyesight would slowly come back and would slowly deteriorate. It all depends on how my body reacts to the radiotherapy. Every day is dferent for me. Every day I wake up and I see something dferent - it might be blurry, it might be fuzzy or I might have double vision. I never know what Iaposm going to wake up to. Iaposm hoping that Iaposll wake up one morning and my visionaposs a bit better, enough so I can see. Karly, whoaposs aposstill coming to termsapos with her impaired vision, said her eye is currently red and sore and that she wonapost know until a couple of months how much vision sheaposs lost. Karly said: I just want to go back and do normal things again. I havenapost been out shopping on my own. Iaposm too worried and get really anxious because I canapost see on my left sidesomeone walks by the side of me. Even just little things, like doing my make-up, are really hard because I canapost see. I canapost draw my eyebrows on because I canapost see and get a lot of double vision so canapost really see and do things how I did before. I have been hiding my face and put my hair right over it so you canapost see that side just because itaposs easier. Looking back now, Iaposve always suffered from really bad headaches and theyaposre one of the symptoms. I noticed at Christmas that I kept getting rings around lights and kept seeing floaty things. But it wasnapost enough for me to be concerned and think there was something wrong with my eye. I just thought they were down to my vision, I didnapost think for a second it would be what it was. A report issued by Specsavers last year revealed that there was a .million drop in the number of eye tests delivered in , a % decline compared to tests administered in . And that an estimated , people have lost vision due to delayed identication and treatment of eye disease, with some experiencing severe sight loss and blindness Kaye Bradley, optometrist at Specsavers Midsomer Norton, said: We really appreciate Karly coming forward and highlighting just how important regular eye examinations are. It’s vital that you see an optometristyou note any changes in your vision. aposThe Optical Coherence Tomography helps us to view the health of your eyes in greater detail, it allows us to see what’s going on beneath the surface of the eye. Many people don’t realise the capabilities of the equipment we have in store with the OCT, coupled with the experience of the team, we are able to help diagnose many eye conditions, as well as make urgent referrals to specialist hospitals when necessary.Do you have a story to share  Email yourmirror@reachplc.

The footage captures the HGV driver taking his eyes off the road while driving on the busy A near Wetherby, West Yorks. He then saw he was being filmed and made the rude gesture to the vehicle next to him. But the driver didnapost realise it was a National Highways unmarked apossupercabapos that had two police officers inside. The silly trucker was issued with a fixed penalty notice for not wearing a seatbelt and using a mobile phone.  He was also handed six penalty points and a £ fine. Simon Boyle, the regional director of Highways England said: The number of people found not wearing their seatbelt, or using their mobile phone while driving is quite alarming. Through this fortnight of action on the A we want to make all of our roads safer by raising awareness and encouraging motorists to consider their driving behaviour.  The apossupercabsapos are being used as part of a two-week multi-agency campaign on the A to reduce the risk of incidents on the route and highlight the risks of dangerous driving. Since they were introduced in , more than , offences have been recorded across England. Other offences caught on camera include a driver eating a lasagne with a kne and fork whilst driving along a motorway and an HGV driver boiling a kettle on the dashboard.  And one driver was caught twice in one day - in the morning and afternoon - using their mobile phone while driving along the A in Derbyshire. Just last year another HGV driver was caught eating from a bowl while driving along the M.An undercover officer busted the haulier after he was spotted whizzing along the motorway with no hands on the wheel, LeicestireshireLive reports. Officers have said the rule-breaker was dealt with accordingly as Leicestershire Police described the vehicle as a -tonne potential killing machine.The force has been out this week as part of Operation Tramline - where undercover officers patrol motorways in an unmarked HGV monitoring other drivers. Previously the operation caught dozens of motorists breaking the rules while driving, and this week was no dferent - spotting a handful of rogue offenders endangering others while driving. Leicestershire Policeaposs tweet said: And here it is.... driving a -tonne potential killing machine whilst cleaning your bowl...neither hand properly holding the steering wheel.

Weighing more than kg, she has now lost .kg and is looking for a new homeShe has now lost .kg and is looking for a new homeBySamantha Mordi:,  Mar |commentsA -year-old cat who weighed the same as a small dog has shed the pounds - and is now looking for a new home. Motsy came into the RSPCAaposs Newport Animal Centre last October after her owner sadly passed away. She weighed .kg - more than twice the weight of an average adult cat and roughly the same as a small dog. Motsyaposs size meant she was unable to get in and out of the cat flap in her pod at the animal centre. Staff at the Newport Animal Centre in Wales, decided that being in a foster home would help her to lose weight and get more exercise. Fosterer Danni Wilson has been looking after Motsy at her home in Newport since November - and the cat now needs a full time home. Danni said: At first she was very nervous and had a particular fear of hands, so I started off by initially stroking her with my head. In the following weeks and months her personality really started to shine through and now she follows me around and likes to play and have a fuss, although everything is very much on her own terms.  We think she became overweight as a result of helping herself to her previous owneraposs food and never going outside to get exercise, although sheaposs slowly started to show an interest in my garden and likes to sit by the back door and enjoy the sun. The weight has gradually begun to come off - sheaposs already lost an two kilogramsand she can now just about reach the base of her tail. She said: But sheaposs still very heavy and will need to continue to shed some pounds to get down to a healthier size. Kath Logan, deputy manager at the centre, said: We think Motsy is the heaviest cat weaposve ever rehomed. Sheaposs a beautul girl who has come such a long way and we are all so proud of her. Sheaposs now feeling much more comfortable in her own skin, but she still struggles to groom herself properly, so she will appreciate an owner that is able to give her a helping hand with this for the foreseeable future. Itaposs also very important that she continues with a sensible feeding regime to enable her to carry on losing weight, and this is something we will discuss with potential owners. Staff feel Motsy would be best suited to an adult home with no other pets with a secure garden or a catio for her to spend time outside.

On Thursday night, the protests began over Child Q – the black teenager scandalously strip-searched by police while menstruating at her school in Hackney, East London.The anger continued on Saturday and Sunday as thousands of adults and kids of all races and faiths voiced their contempt. More protests are planned in and outside the borough.Absolutely right too. Child Q’s private parts were exposed during the search. She was asked to bend over and cough by police who dragged her out of an exam because a teacher wrongly suspected her of carrying drugs. At her school hundreds of pupils went on strike last week, refusing to attend lessons and staging sit-ins. Teenagers at other schools in Hackney are preparing similar acts of defiance this week. They don’t feel safe. They don’t feel protected. How can they when – as the report into the scandal confirms – teachers leave the room and give officers carte blanche instead of acting in loco parentis  Who acts as the chaperone or the witness for Child Q’s defence  Who is there to tell the officers they are crossing the line And where, still, is the condemnation from Home Secretary Priti Patel or her boss, Boris Johnson I’d have gone ballisticChild Q had been my daughter. What breaks my heart as a dad is that so many of us parents have long since made our girlsaware of their rights so that no teacher or police officer could ever try to violate them in that way. Because the truth is that this kind of outrage tends to happen moreyou are black. The official report concludes as much on top of what we know already. But this weekend’s fightback is a line in the sand. A move towards real solutions – in Hackney and beyond. More black parents and s are signing up to become school governors. Kids are educating themselves on the legal boundaries for teachers and police. Because with a teacher we I am obviously supportive of the profession but some are entitled. Patronising towards parents and simply unwilling to listen to black children. Teenagers are using their voices to ensure they are not left as abandoned and traumatised as Child Q was in the room of that Hackney school. We’ve reached a watershed moment. Now the police have to be removed from our places of education. Especially the schools comprising pupils from poorer backgrounds and ethnic minorities. Once called upon, the report says, four officers arrived. You can see why Child Q would have been intimidated into complying with their demands. Much as the police and teachers might like to claim otherwise, the numbers suggest black children are racially discriminated against from an early age. A report from the Georgetown Law Centre on Poverty and Inequality, in Washington, D.C, US, found that adults saw black girls “as less inno­cent and more adult-like than white girls of the same age, espe­cial­ly between five- years old”. As such, they are presumed guilty when accused and treated more harshly by authority figures. And, surprise, surprise, black Caribbean students in our schools are excluded up to six times more than their white counterparts. Child Q has further exposed a crisis in our education system. Like you or I would, she is rightly suing the living daylights out of the school and police. But for our kids to be protected the culture has to be crushed.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative PartyEducationSchoolsPoliticsRacismDaily MirrorPriti Patel\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pair, from Southport, Merseyside, now have to raise £, in a week to save her le after she was diagnosed with patent ductus arteriosus .The defect can be deadlyleft untreated and consists of a hole in an artery that fails to close after birth. Vets requested that Bella go under the kne within a week for her to have any chance of survival, due to her condition being previously undiagnosed. Her operation is scheduled for March . Raf and Daria, originally from Poland, saw Bella advertised online and were reassured that the puppy had undergone standard health checks.  Two days after collecting the pup, they took her to the vets for a check-up and were told the heartbreaking news that she would need urgent surgery. Daria, , said: Three weeks ago, on February , we bought the dog off this private seller. We were told sheaposs had health checks and that she was brilliant so we believed them and bought her. After two days we took her to the vet who checked her. She said she needed a scan. So we booked the scan for the following week and the scan found that she had PDA which means she has a hole in an artery. She now needs an operation to close the hole. After this, we hope sheaposll be fine but we canapost get anyone to insure her because she has a pre-existing health condition. When we rang the seller and they denied selling her to us. After we said they did, the person just said it was their dad and that he would ring us. Since then we havenapost heard from them and they wonapost answer the phone. We were hoping they would pay for the operation becausewe gave her back they would probably kill her since she wouldnapost earn them any money. If the family do not manage to raise the money, they plan on taking out a loan to fund the operation. Daria also explained that since they got Bella, their five-year-old daughter, Kornelia, has fallen in love with her. She said: Weaposve only had her three weeks but we love her. We also have a five-year-old and she said to me: aposMum, please donapost give her to the angels. Iaposll give you all my money out of my piggy bankapos. She is melting my heart.

Itaposs a good talking point for the kids I work with. They show a lot of interest. All the kids are absolutely great with it. I get so many messages from people asking what I do for a job because they want to get a tattoo, but they darenapost because they wonapost be able to get employed. But I think itaposs how you come across. People look at you and they think aposoh you look aggressive.apos But once they get talking to you everyoneaposs been fine. Not only has Karacaposs extreme body art helped with his professional career but itaposs also opened other opportunities as well, including modelling and appearing on hit TV show Top Boy.  Karacaposs first tattoo was a small inking on his chest but seven years ago, he started getting more tattoos and covering his entire body. He explained: I started going to conventions all over Europe with my mates and they tattooed me for free. They were pretty packed events. Iaposve been to ones in Belgium that were absolutely massive. The Yorkshireman has tattoos of musical icons such as Kurt Cobain on his scalp, as well as Tupac, Elvis, Amy Winehouse, Eazy-E, Johnny Cash and many more. There is hardly any bare skin left on him to be tattooed, with even his bum and armpits fully adorned with inkings. He said: Iaposve literally got my face left, and a tiny gap on my hip and just below on one bum cheek, thataposs it.  Iaposve had my armpits done both bum cheeks done, literally everything done. I said Iaposd never go on my face, but I started. Karac managed to get a lot of his tattoos for free thanks to being inked live at conventions but he estimates he has £k worth of tattoos on his body. He said his most painful tattoos were his nipples, which he had blacked out. It looked weird just having pink nipples sticking out. They only took a few minutes but that was the worst one aposcause it was like five minutes of hell. And also getting my ribs and armpits done were pretty bad. Face tattoos are the least painful and that why itaposs a slippery slope getting face tattoos because they donapost hurt at all.Karac posts pictures to his Instagram account under the name tattedjesus, where brands that want to work with him will approach him.However, it does also lead to unwanted attention as well.  People behind computers will send you nasty messages but I think with social media now itaposs so easy to bully or to just say something horrible, Karac said. I get a lot of racist comments as well. Itaposs bizarre but I just block people. People will say, you canapost have kids aposcause youaposre covered in tattoos. I donapost get why people assume that aposcause youaposve got tattoos you canapost have kids. And itaposs not just online where the dad-of-four will get attention. If I go out without a cap on, I just get stared at everywhere, people pointing and stuff like that asIaposm a freak show or something. But itaposs just because itaposs dferent. I get a lot of comments from people who say aposyour head looks amazing, who did your portraits, who has done your tattoos,apos However, the most important opinion to Karac are those of his family. He has four children, an -year-old, an -year-old, a seven-year-old and a two-year-old. Theyaposve always been around people with tattoos so they donapost see anything dferent but some of their mates will be like aposoh your dadaposs got all tattoos on his faceapos. But I donapost get any negative comments from kids. Karacaposs we has tattoos but not as many as him and he says sheaposs not bothered about his head tattoos.

From Saturday, April , parkrun will no longer allow runner to use a waist harneses when participating in the five-kilometre run with their dogs.They state clear evidence shows an increased risk to peopleaposs safety when running alongside another participant with a dog, with some becoming tangled in or tripping over the dogaposs lead.But Kevin Ward, , who runs at Kesgrave, in Suffolk, with his dog, Wilson, says his pet has become so wellknown people have begun cheering him on during their runs.  Disappointed by the new rules, Kevin is hoping to set up a similar event in Kesgrave, called Barkrun, where owners will be able to exercise their pets while using either a harness, short or long lead. Under parkrunaposs new rules, dogs should be kept on a short, handheld, non-extendable lead by the side of the participant and should remain within reach at all time. Only one dog is allowed per participant and care must be taken to avoid tripping other parkrunners. A statement from parkrun reads: Over ten percent of incidents at parkrun events involve dogs, and as such we have spent signicant time considering the nature, frequency, and severity of dog-related incidents. Our evidence shows that, when participants use waist harnesses, there is an increased risk of serious incidents, particularly trips and falls, compared to when using handheld leads. These are typically associated with dogs running in front of other participants, and are occurring when people are together in groups, when people with dogs are overtaking others, and when people with dogs are being overtaken.  Unfortunately, the nature of parkrunning with a waist harness is such that the lead allows dogs to move from side to side, in front of the participant, which can result in the dog suddenly and unexpectedly crossing in front of other participants on the course.Despite assuring runners dogs are still welcome at parkrun, members have taken to Facebook to vent their frustration at new rules.One user said: This is such a shame. It was great to get out and exercise my dog while I run. I feel it is much more unsafe to be running with a dog in a handheld lead, you can end up letting go of the lead oryou fall you have no hands to catch yourself. I also love the way having my dog open up conversations and connections with other runners and I wonapost be running with my dog on a handheld lead. While another user added: This country is not dog friendly! They aren’t welcome in lots of places. I thought parkrun was dferent but it following suit. Lots of dog haters on here that have no clue! The parkrun statement adds: Since the earliest days of parkrun, we’ve openly welcomed people participating with their dogs. Paul Sinton-Hewitt, the founder of parkrun, would participate in the Bushy Park Time Trial with his, and we’ve always felt that it was not only something that emphasised the informal nature of our events, but provided an opportunity for dog owners to participate where they otherwise might be excluded. Over the last  years however, we have grown from a single event into a global movement, with hundreds of thousands of weekly participants, across  dferent countries. As such we continually review our processes in order to balance accessibility and inclusivity with the safety of our participants and other park users. Importantly, we remain of the belief that, overall, the benefits of allowing participation with dogs far outweigh the risks of doing so. Our commitment has always been, and always will be, to support participation with dogs wherever it is appropriate to do so. Do you have a dog story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

Mixed breed Nina was rescued by Wild At Heart Foundationfrom the streets of Lebanon, where she was found paralysed from the waist down.The three-year-old stray has adapted well to le with two working legs and rescuers say her courage and happy personality is so contagious, it touches everyone she meets.Jenner Musson at WAHF told The Mirror : Nina is such a special girl and she hasnapost let her disability hinder her wonderful spirit.As she needs extensive care and support, we worry it might be hard to find her a home. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Affectionate Nina is currently living in Lincolnshire while she struggles to find a new family in the UK. Staff say her favourite past time is watching the ways of the world through the window in the living room. When sheaposs not laying in the sun or cuddling up with humans, she loves whizzing around in her cart and seeking out birds in the garden. Like many rescue dogs, Nina can get somewhat confused by toys, but has found friendship in a squeaky duck which has been labelled her best friend. She has been described by rescuers as inquisitive by nature as she enjoys licky mats, kongs and figuring out new puzzles.Nina had learnt aposlay downapos, aposstayapos, aposwaitapos and aposleaveapos since arriving in the UK and is highly motivated by food, so training comes easy to her. The former street dog is still getting used to some new things and can be startled by loud traffic and noisy household appliances. She can also be unsettled in the car but soon relaxes on journeys. WAHF will not be considering first time dog owners and are looking for an adopter who lives in a semi-rural location and is at home most of the day. Nina would love a big, supportive family and has successfully lived with another dog and a cat, and is also great with the children she meets.She can be just as fast and boisterous as any other dogs and keeps up with them during play time. As Nina is paralysed from the waist down, applicants need to be aware and dedicated to her ongoing needs, as well as committed to the costs of her veterinary care. Her bladder needs to be expressed four times a day and she requires daily cleaning and care of her skin and hind legs.The adoption fee for Nina is £.

Heres everything you need to know about why free-range eggs are being labelled as barn eggs insteadFree-range eggs will be labelled barn eggs across UK supermarkets Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Mar |comments Cases of avian flu, which began rising in the country in November, , have led to the biggest ever outbreak of bird flu in Great Britain and the death of thousands of birds. In order to keep cases under control amid the outbreak has resulted in the government enforcing an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone across the UK.While it should help to prevent case numbers from increasing, the prevention measures will mean that free-range eggs will not be able to be labelled as such in the near future. They were given a -week grace period, whereby farmers were able to maintain their free-range status, but this ended on March, , .Hereaposs why free-range eggs are being replaced in UK supermarkets.Why are free-range eggs no longer available in the UK   Free-range eggs, which accounts for % of all eggs produced in the UK according to RSPCA, come from birds that enjoy unlimited access to outdoor pastures during the daytime. Free-range laying hens can be kept indoors only for up to  weeks for their eggs to still be labelled free-range, however, this period has ended, with birds still being kept in containment, due to there still being a high level of risk to birds of catching flu.  A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsexplained: The -week grace period we allowed for free-range eggs has now been exceeded, and eggs must now be marketed as ‘barn eggs’. We have worked closely with the sector and retailers to implement these changes as smoothly as possible. The avian, or bird, flu outbreak controls mean that there is a legal requirement for all poultry farmers in the UK to keep their birds, whether pets or commercial flocks, indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures as well. What are barn eggs  Eggs in UK shops will no longer classy as free-range because the birds have been kept inside for more than  weeks. The eggs will therefore be labelled as barn eggs. This is the name given to eggs produced by permanently indoor birds. The British Retail Consortium said that signs will be put in supermarkets to inform shoppers of the change in labelling, adding that the previous free-range label willonly after the hens are permitted to go outside again. Andrea Martinez-Inchausti, assistant director of food at the British Retail Consortium, said shops and supermarkets would continue to support British farmers. What is avian flu and is it dangerous  According to the NHS, bird flu or avian flu is a highly infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds. The disease typically poses a very low risk to humans, though people have previously been infected by it around the world.With the UK facing its largest-ever outbreak of avian flu, the government has stated that it would work with farmers and retailers to implement any branding changes to eggs as long as the housing measures to protect poultry remain in place.

On March  alone there were , cases reported, however, health secretary Sajid Javid has said there is no particular cause for concern, as we now strive to live with the virus. The legal requirement to self isolateyou catch Covid has been dropped in England, and the government is ending the provision of free tests from April . People are now being urged to act with personal responsibility, although the NHS is still advising that you should stay at home and avoid contact with other people. If you do test positive for coronavirus, hereaposs some things you might want to know, including how long youaposll test positive and how long to self isolate for.How long will I test positive for Covid   Most people will stop testing positive for Covid within  days of starting to experience symptoms, or receiving their first positive test. However, itaposs possible to still test positive for weeks, or sometimes months after having the virus. Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance says itaposs possible to test positive for Covid- for weeks, but people are not likely to be contagious for very long.It explains: The time taken to test negative after contracting Covid- depends on the severity of the case, and also on the test itself. PCR tests that hunt out parts of viral genetic materialin our bodies and amply it so we can detect it are extremely sensitive and can even pick up the presence of few viral fragments. This is because fragments of viral RNA can remain in our bodies long after the infection is over and the virus has been cleared from our system.” In general, itaposs reported that asymptomatic people can test positive for one to two weeks, while those with mild-to-moderate disease continue to test positive for a week or more. How long should you self isolate for  You are no longer required by law to self isolate in England and Northern Ireland. However, the NHS recommends you stay at home and avoid contact with other people. You also no longer need to take daily Covid testsyouaposve been in close contact with someone with coronavirus in England. According to the NHS, you should stay at home while youaposre infectious to others. It adds: This can be up to  days from when your symptoms start. Many people will no longer be infectious to others after five days. The NHS recommends you do rapid lateral flow tests from five days after your symptoms startedand another the next day. It adds: If both tests are negative and you do not have a high temperature, youaposre less likely to pass Covid- to others and you can go back to your normal routine. If your test result is positive on day five, you can carry on doing rapid lateral flow tests every day until you get two negative test results in a row. In Scotland and Wales you are still required by law to self-isolate after testing positive for Covid. How long do symptoms last   According to the NHS, most people feel better within a few days or weeks and most people make a full recovery within  weeks.However, Covid symptoms can last longer.According to the Zoe Covid Study App, most people recover within two weeks, and one in  people have symptoms after three weeks. Those who suffer for longer than usual may have something called long Covid, which describes symptoms you may have after infection.

In the last eight years over  practices have closed.  Two and half million patients have lost access to their family doctor.If the Government doesn’t act now every family who relies on the NHS will find basic healthcare under threat.”Mr Hunt said: “The best thing about the NHS is having your own family doctor.

Dr Sharrock added: “There are processes where practices going through a short term problem can close their lists for a period of time. “But realistically every practice should close its list because we can’t take the workload we are already doing. “If the pressure on GPs continues so they think it is unsafe, it can take one or two of them to leave and suddenly you can’t run the practice. “We have a contract with the NHS and at any point, we can give three monthsapos notice and say ‘actually we can’t run this contract anymore.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British Medical AssociationNHSBoris JohnsonJeremy HuntHospitalsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The team’s work is expected to be completed by autumn.” The decision to can the probe has raised questions about whether or not the case’s prime suspect will be charged with the disappearance of the girl. Who is the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann investigation German police have named their prime suspect as -year-old Christian Brueckner, who is currently in prison for separate crimes. German prosecutors say they have “concrete” evidence against him and is their only suspect, who is current serving a jail sentence for the rape of an American woman in . Brueckner was named as the prime suspect after phone records placed him at the Portuguese resort on the night Madeleine went missing. He has accused prosecutors of making “scandalous” claims against him, saying they bring “shame” on the German legal system. Why is the Madeleine McCann case going to end  The budget for the investigation is due to run out at the end of March, despite former Met Police chief Cressida Dick saying that the operation would only end once every lead had been probed. In the past few years, the size of the team working on Operation Grange has shrunk from  officers down to just four. Led by Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell, the investigation is believed to have cost around £ million. The investigation has been spearheaded by German and Portuguese authorities, with Met cops in a supporting role. A request for more money has reportedly been sent into the Home Office, which would take the operation to the end of September. Could the Madeleine McCann case be reopened   Yes,there was a further breakthrough the case would be reopened - although detectives will not be actively investigating in the meantime. Madeleine’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, have vowed they will never stop looking for their daughter and may look to use the specially created fund - Madeleine’s Fund: Leave No Stone Unturned - which currently has over £, available.

Then as soon as lockdown was lted last year, Tom and Fin began their holidays around the UK together.  In April , they went on their first visit to Portsmouth, and then every weekend after that. By the end of last year, they had visited countless places across England, south Wales and Scotland, learning history and exploring a small part of the world. Fin loved venturing on dferent forms of transport that would usually scare Tom, including a steam railway in Norfolk, a boat in Weymouth, a train in Yorkshire and an aeroplane in Scotland.

His sacking was deemed unfair at an employment tribunalHe was sacked despite an unblemished  year career Image: SOPA Images LightRocket via Getty ImagesByKelly-Ann MillsNews Reporter:,  Mar |comments A veteran postman has won more than £, after he was sacked for taking a piece of chewing gum out of his mouth and sticking it on a lantern on a garden gate. Graham Harvey was spotted by the homeowner who complained to his bosses, showing CCTV evidence of his aposdisgustingapos behaviour.The then  year old was sacked for gross misconduct after the video also showed him driving without a seat belt and leaving his Royal Mail van unlocked. But an employment tribunal ruled he was unfairly dismissed as none of these actions should have amounted to a sackable offence. He has now been awarded £,. in compensation. The Scottish tribunal heard Mr Harvey had worked for Royal Mail for  years when he was sacked following the incident in .  He was based at its Prestonpans office near Edinburgh, where he had a predominantly rural route to deliver to. The hearing was told that in October that year, a customer visited the office to make a complaint about Mr Harvey. The complaint was that he had aposremoved a piece of chewing gum from his mouth and placed it on a gate lantern at the propertyapos. The incident was captured on CCTV footage which was emailed to his manager along with a photograph. The customeraposs email described the conduct as aposdisgustingapos, but he said he and his we did not wish to aposmake a huge fuss about itapos. The tribunal heard the video also showed Mr Harvey driving his vehicle without a seatbelt and leaving items of mail on the front passenger seat. On histo work the following Monday, Jordan Cree, the delivery office manager, asked Mr Harvey to have a word in his office. Mr Harvey admitted to driving without a seatbelt and leaving items of mail on his passenger seat but denied placing chewing gum on the customeraposs premises.  The tribunal heard he was suspended at the end of the meeting pending aposfurther investigations into an alleged incident where you have defaced a customeraposs propertyapos. A disciplinary meeting was held in October, when Mr Harvey admitted all of the allegations against him including the placing of chewing gum on the customeraposs property. He described it as a aposstupid decisionapos and said he had done it aposon two occasions at mostapos. He offered to apologise to the customer. He also admitted driving without a seatbelt in rural locations and added it was aposcommon practiceapos for him and for many others over many years,not decades, to drive without seatbelts in certain situations at certain locations. Concerns were also raised of potential aposmassive reputational damageapos to Royal Mail arising from the CCTV being placed on social media, but the tribunal heard no evidence any video being posted. The tribunal heard he was sacked at the end of the meeting after bosses ruled all three offences were gross misconduct. He then lost an appeal with another manager saying he believed the chewing gum issue was a aposdeliberate act on [Mr Harveyaposs] part to cause anxiety and distressapos. Employment Judge Ronald Mackay ruled the dismissal was unfair, as not wearing a seatbelt and leaving mail on the passenger seat were aposcommon practicesapos known to management, while the chewing gum issue was not serious enough to be deemed gross misconduct. Royal Mail bosses told the tribunal that they believed Mr Harvey should be treated more harshly given that with hisof service he should have known the rules. Criticising this approach, Judge Mackay said: To dismiss, for a first offence, an employee with a clean record and  years service, should not have been approached with that mind-set.

Infected patients who took part in this latest study were three times as likely to have a blood clot - known medically as a thromboembolism, scientists discovered. Thromboembolism can cause a blockage in the main artery of the lung or form where and become le threatening. Overall, the coronavirus raised the risk of a severe maternal illness two-and-a-half times, researchers found.Pre-term births during early, middle, and late terms of the pregnancy doubled, while birth may need to be induced early when the mother has a condition such as pre-eclampsia, the study revealed.Dr Assiamira Ferrara, a lead author of the study at Calornia-based care consortium Kaiser Permanente, said: These findings add to growing evidence having Covid- during pregnancy raises risks of serious complications.The findings were based on , expectant women in the US of whom , became infected. Dr Ferrara added: Coupled with the evidence the Covid- vaccines are safe during pregnancy, these findings should aid patients in understanding the risks of perinatal complications and the need for vaccination. This study supports the recommendation for vaccination of pregnant iniduals and those planning conception. Calornia-based care consortium Kaiser Permanente tracked participants from before conception to delivery to identy links between before and after birth complications.  Covid was diagnosed through a PCR test by the researchers. The racially and ethnically erse group was followed from March  to March . Those who tested positive were more likely to be younger, obese, Hispanic, have had multiple babies or live in a poor neighbourhood, scientists said. Dr Mara Greenberg, a co-author of the study and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, said: Our study was large, erse, and supports the need for vaccination by pregnant iniduals and those who plan to get pregnant. The most important thing people can do to protect themselves and their baby is to get vaccinated.  The analysis found almost six per cent of patients with a coronavirus infection during pregnancy had a related hospitalisation. That was most likely for black or Asian or Pacic islanders and patients with pre-gestational diabetes, the study found. Researchers compared patients who gave birth before and after December , when universal Covid testing of pregnant patients began. They found a positive test rate of . and . per cent, respectively. The same health risks applied to both groups. The US team is continuing to research Covid and pregnancy, focusing on telemedicine and health care delivery during the pandemic.  Dr Monique Hedderson, another study co-author, said: We are also planning to follow both mothers and children to study possible short and long-term health effects of coronavirus infections during pregnancy. In November analysis of , pregnant women in France found those with Covid were  times as likely to die during childbirth, scientists said. The study was published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The blue vehicle was left stranded on an island with freshly laid tarmac surrounding it outside a cemetery. The car was spotted in the same position in Ocklynge Cemetery car park in Eastbourne, East Sussex, two days after the resurfacing work was carried out on March . It was still in the same place a week after the resurfacing was carried out. Appeals from the council to keep all spaces clear were aposignoredapos, the authority said.  Eastbourne Borough Council said workers will have to go back at a later date to resurface the square the car is occupying. Phil Hall, who lives in the seaside town, said: Itaposs a comical sight, but itaposs also a waste of council taxpayersapos money as theyaposll now have toto the site to fill it in. A spokesman for the authority said: The Eldon Road entrance to Ocklynge Cemetery has been resurfaced. One car, unfortunately, did not note our appeal to move vehicles beforehand, so we will be ing to resurface this space. Meanwhile, last week an ex-cop was left furious after receiving a parking fine for no reason. On February , Paul Murphy was travelling into Leeds, West Yorkshire, for a business meeting and parked on a public side road, close by to the Tesco supermarket.Speaking to Leeds Live, he claims he never went in to the supermarket, or parked in the car park.He added that he thinks there is a camera in the entranceway, designed to catch people as they go inside. Paul said there were no signs along the road, but one sight said taxis would receive priority at pm. He said: It was unusual that there were no visible signs as there is usually something. For three hours, he had his car parked in the spot, whilst he went about his day. Later, he was given a £ fine, delivered in his postbox from Horizon Parking, stating he had overstayed his welcome. Horizon runs several supermarket car parks across the UK, including Asda, Co-Op and Tesco. Paul said: I think there must be a camera there and it pinged mine. Seems there is an ANPR parking fault at the back of Beeston Tesco. Horizon Parking tried to fine me for overstay in the shop car park. The problem is that most people would say aposIaposm going to get doneI donapost pay itapos but itaposs not OK. Itaposs a lot of money to fork out. I did an appeal and it didnapost take me long to do. He appealed the fine and two weeks later was told it had been overridden.

It was always ‘I’ll do something tomorrow’ or ‘I will start on a Monday’ but nothing would ever happen. I needed to have some accountability.  Smoking cannabis really impacted my lestyle. I smoked it every day without fail since probably the age of . I wanted to quit, so I thoughtI joined the gym, that gives me more reason to. During the working day, he would drive to the nearest McDonaldaposs for breakfast every day before indulging in a Greggs for lunch. He said: I had no interest in exercise, I had no motivation. I was really lazy and unfit. I spent most of my time sat on the couch. I had no idea about nutrition so I just ate whatever was easiest and most convenient. But Carlaposs lestyle concerns came to a head when he realised it was causing him to feel depressed and suffer low energy.He signed up for a -week programme with his we, Cheryl, , at Ultimate Performance gym in Spinningfields last summer.Before his transformation, Carl described himself as aposskinny fatapos - with skinny arms and legs but a larger belly.  After training at the gym three times a week and by overhauling his diet, he lost two stone in weight and his body fat percentage dropped from  per cent to nine. Cheryl, who is a specialist nurse, also lost almost two stone after cutting out junk food and training with her partner. They plan and prep all of their freshly cooked meals, which consist of boiled eggs or porridge for breakfast, salmon salads for lunch, and chicken and vegetables for their evening meal. Although the change was tough initially, Carl claims the transformation has helped him in every aspect of his le and others have noticed the dference too.  Walking into the gym was nerve-wracking and overwhelming but I was made to feel at ease straight away, Carl said. It was a big change that was hard at first, but once we got used to it, I started really enjoying it and the meals. Eight months on, the couple have sustained their healthy regime and even hit the gym together four to five times a week with their son who enjoys Lego club and swimming lessons while they workout. Carl said: I’m a lot more confident, I’m out more, I’m able to do more in work and it’s easier, I’m more active, more sociable. I’m definitely happier. I was stoned all the time so I was always insecure and wanted to be left alone. The gym gave me something to do, it was probably more through boredom that I used to smoke and then eat sh*tty foods all the time. One habit led to another. Carl added: It’s completely changed my le. The way I used to live then to the way I live now, it’s completely dferent two completely dferent people.

They are avoided by aeroplanes because they create in-flight turbulence.  But larger lenticular formations were pictured over northern Scotland and the borders earlier this year.A Met Office spokesperson told EdinburghLive : These strange, unnatural looking clouds sometimes form downwind of hills or mountains.They are quite unusual in the British Isles but do occasionally occur.“They look a lot like the traditional shape of flying saucers in science fiction, and real lenticular clouds are believed to be one of the most common explanations for UFO sightings across the world.When air blows across a mountain range, in certain circumstances, it can set up a train of large standing waves in the air downstream, rather like ripples forming in a river when water flows over an obstruction. If there is enough moisture in the air, the rising motion of the wave will cause water vapour to condense, forming the unique appearance of lenticular clouds. Lenticular clouds are a visible sign of mountain waves in the air. However, these waves can be present beyond the clouds, and may exist even when no clouds are formed. On the ground, they can result in very strong gusty winds in one place, with still air only a few hundred metres away. Pilots of powered aircraft tend to avoid flying near lenticular clouds because of the turbulence that accompany them. Skilledglider pilots, on the other hand, like them, because they can tell from the shape of the clouds where the air will be rising.

The balmy conditions wonapost last forever, but Met Office forecasters say this week will still be a warmer than average period for March.Richard Miles, Met Office spokesman, told the : The warmest day of the week in this dry period is going to be today and tomorrow. In one or two places it might creep up to as high as C, and it will drop down at the weekend. The temperatures for the rest of the week will be above average but it just wonapost be as warm.  Mr Miles says that by Thursday, there will be a noticeable temperature dference, but conditions will still be fine and dry. He added: You have isolated places that will see C today and tomorrow and on Thursday you will be looking at C or C - which is still above the March average. You will have more cloud around the second half of the week where it will feel a bit milder, but it will be fine and dry.  The mercury is likely to sit at C to C today but Met Office forecasters are predicting highs of C on Tuesday. Temperatures should then hold steady in most of England at around C or C through the rest of the week and into the weekend - warmer than the average for March. Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said: This week is going to be very similar. Weaposre going to keep high pressure just to the east of the UK and that means it will be largely dry and settled with plenty of sunny spells.  There is the odd exception, there could just be an isolated shower across the Midlands on Monday, perhaps northern England on Tuesday, but theyaposre going to be very isolated and most places will be dry and sunny. Mr Dewhurst added sheltered areas will continue to be on the pleasant and warm side. The temperature is expected to remain above average into the weekend but will then drop slightly into the following week. The mercury hit .C in Kinlochewe in Scotland on Saturday. This is some way off the highest UK March temperature which was .C recorded in Cambridgeshire on March  .

After going into labour with her daughter Phoebe Belle, -year-old Bethany Collins was given Pitocin, a synthetic hormone that helps stimulate a womanaposs uterus muscles and cause contractions, so as to speed things along.However, despite this, Bethanyaposs cervix still wasnapost opening. She was experiencing severe contractions and, given that her babyaposs heart rate was dropping, she opted for an epidural. After pushing with all her might to help deliver her daughter, Bethany felt an intense pressure in her left eye and realised something was wrong.

Bethany said: “I heard a pop and asked the doctor ‘is my eyeball still in my head ’ He said yes, but I opened my eyes and everything was blurry. I felt so much pressure in my left eye, but I pushed again for the third time and she came. “They took her to make sure she was okay, before handing her over to me. I asked my husband ‘is my eyeball really in my head  It can’t be – I feel so much pressure and I can barely see anything, something has to be wrongapos. He said that it was definitely poking out more than the one, but it wasn’t too bad. After  minutes had passed, Bethanyaposs eye began poking out even further, with the situation continuing to worsen overnight.As he was stitching her up, Bethanyaposs doctor remarked that heaposd never seen such a thing happen before, and so decided to call an optometrist to have a look. Bethany said: “I told him [I wasn’t in any pain] but he just continued looking at my eye. I had pretty much the whole unit come and look too – I became the talk of the unit that day. My sweet nurse askedI wanted a patch, so I could at least see out of my good eye without any interference. She got me a pack of nipple covers and I used them instead. She added: “The next day, the optometrist looked at my eye and also commented that he had never seen something like this before. “Ultimately, the final verdict was that there was just a lot of pressure from the force of the push, so said to wait and seeit would go back. I noticed improvements at the two-week mark and it was like I got a black eye. It was protruding and bruised.Thankfully, Bethanyaposs eyes are back to normal now, and sheaposs enjoying le as a new mother to little Phoebe Belle. Bethany continued: It took six weeks for my eye to finally flush back into my face and even it out with the other, but I really thought I was doomed. Things are now great, as I have a beautul two-month-old baby girl and two normal eyeballs.In a video shared via TikTok, Bethany opened up about her ordeal, clocking up more than . million views and , likes at the time of writing.Bethany begins her vid by lip-syncing: “I think I would look so sexy pregnant”, going on to reveal a photo of her shortly after giving birth. The text reads, “My eye popped out while I was pushing, with the pic clearly showing how one of Bethanyaposs eyes was notably lower than the other, protruding from her face. One viewer shuddered, “New fear unlocked, while another wrote, “Hi ma’am I’m six months pregnant and I need you to keep things like this to yourself. A third person went as far as to declare, “I’m never having a child, while a fourth remarked, This is why I closed my eyes.Do you have a childbirth-related story to share  We pay for stories.

But thataposs not the experience one woman on Reddit had after her mum completely took over the planning for her wedding and controlled things so much she pushed her daughter to want to elope instead. In her post, the woman claimed she initially only wanted a maximum of  people at her wedding, but her mum had made a guest list of  and had been pushing her to go down the traditional route. She said: My fiancé proposed in October of ! I was thrilled of course and immediately told my mum and dad - Iaposm an only child so they were also thrilled. My mum immediately began planning which is great, I can use all the help I could get, but it turned into multiple daily texts and demands.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Our list was - people, hers was . I wanted a smaller unique wedding, she wanted traditional. I wanted a vintage style gown from , she wanted me in a ball gown. It was driving me CRAZY. The stress was making me sick and I was avoiding all contact with her because I just couldnapost do it. Eventually, the woman asked her partnerhe would be okay with eloping instead, and when he was on board they decided to tell her mum about their plan - which only made things worse. She added: She handled it surprisingly well at first, and we thought we may actually get what we wanted - a private, no fuss, quiet time with a friend there to sign the paper and spending the rest of the day just the two of us doing whatever we love. But no. My mother had to make it about her.  It started with her trying to plan a small ceremony at my future mother-in-lawaposs house with my fiancéaposs stepfather officiating. Not once had we mentioned wanting to have the ceremony nevermind at someoneaposs house, but my mum brought the plans up to my mother-in-law, despite me telling her thanks but no thanks. I had to be blunt with my mother after that. Not only had she tried to take charge of this, but she had gone behind our backs and tried to make it happen when we said no. The woman told her mum that all she wanted was to sign the marriage certicate with her fiancé and have her friend - who is also a photographer - witness the signing as well as take a few photos.  Earlier this month, the woman and her now-husband went ahead and eloped as planned, and even let her mum plan a celebratory dinner after the event as a compromise. She explained: We eloped on March . My friend did the photoshoot for us and we exchanged rings and vows, even got to have our first dance in a beautul old train station - it was everything we wanted. My mother wasnapost happy about not being a part of our vows photoshoot ring exchange dance but we had compromised and had dinner with the entire family. She chose the place, picked a cake, chose who we invited, and all that rubbish. But you know what - I had an amazing time with my new husband and my amazing friend, we were still able to keep our spirits up despite her taking over the dinner, and we got married! And while the woman is over the moon with her marriage and the way the wedding turned out, her mum is now refusing to speak to her and has made little to no contact with her since the wedding day. She said: Since then, my mum has been little to no contact despite letting me know she would be kicking me off her insurance for my car and I needed to figure it out. Iaposm honestly fine with the limited contact and my stress has been greatly reduced because of it. It sucks that I canapost ever be the daughter she wants but Iaposm sick of my boundaries being ignored. My husband and I are planning a reception during the summer to celebrate and are making sure she has absolutely nothing to do with it until she receives the invite a month before. F**k it.

The unusual wash area is right next to the double bedroom but there are no walls, or a door to create any sort of privacy, meaning any friends stopping the night will have to be very close indeed.

House-hunting horror fans had a bidding war at an auction for the stone-built chapel which is built next to a graveyard. It was once surrounded by woodland when it was built in the th century - and legend says it is even haunted by a baying hound after claims a former minister heard its blood-curdling howls. Folklore has it that a former minister saw the great black beast before striking it between the eyes with his Bible. The property is believed to be haunted by the black hound of the underworld in Cwmbran, South Wales.  The mythical creature is said to have burst into flames and disappeared - leaving the clergyman with a singed beard. The chapel in St Dials went under the hammer with a guide price of £, - but sold for £, more after  bids from three bidders. Property seekers will soon discover, it is built in the centre a new suburb. And sellers say it could be let out as a quirky airbnb let and would provide peace and quiet and be unlikely to be disturbed by new-build home owners. The chapelaposs spooky history and legends are likely to deter many would-be owners butsomeone has an interest in the supernatural, it might make a dream home a dream. They say its history would make it a fine property which could be converted for everyday use. Despite dating back to the th century, it has no planning restrictions in place and is not a listed building. This will give the new buyer a bank canvas and either allow them to preserve its ancient history or incorporate it in any development.  Debra Bisley, of Paul Fosh Auctions, said: I donapost know about the mysterious Black Hound and the ministeraposs beard but the chapel and graveyard is certainly unusual plonked as it is in the middle of the modern estate. Sympathetically converted it could make a lovely house or may be an unusual airbnb property. There would be no nuisance or noise from the immediate neighbours. The detached chapel, of stone construction under a pitch tiled roof, is believed to date back to the th century. Itaposs understood not to be listed and has planning for conversion to residential uses. The site also offers potential for the creation of off road parking.

The critics say: “Despite the current war, Switzerland continues to host an accomplice of Putin’s regime.” It added that it was time for the neutral country “to take action” and send her home to Putin, .Kabaeva is seldom seen in public - but was caught on video dancing in Moscow in December amid fears Putin was planning to go to war in Ukraine. Recent reports have claimed she is seeing out the war with her rumoured children in a mountain retreat in Switzerland.“We, the citizens of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, which is currently undergoing immense suffering, are uniting to appeal to the Swiss authorities,” states the petition in German, French and English and posted on change.org, so far signed by almost ,.“The public has just learned that the Russian political and media figure, and former [rhythmic gymnast], Alina Kabaeva, is hiding the consequences of the sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation in your country.  “She is the favourite we of [the] delusional dictator and war criminal who has been treacherously attacking Ukraine over the past weeks. “As she is supportive of social activities in Russia, she has been attempting to get Russian citizens accustomed to the reality of sanctions after , and personally proclaimed: ‘The worse it gets, the better for us!’” The signatories question why “given the volume of sanctions placed on Russia” the authorities continue to host her and her family at a time when Putin “is destroying the lives of millions”. The West has so far not sanctioned Kabaeva - although as well as being Putin’s rumoured secret partner, she is also chairman of the board of directors at National Media Group, a major Kremlin-obedient TV and newspaper behemoth, at a salary of almost £ million a year. The petition tells the Swiss: For the first time in modern history, your country has violated its neutrality, which it did not even do vis-à-vis Nazi Germany in the th century, and joined the sanctions against Putin and his surroundings.“And now you are allowing his favourite mistress and her children to hide within the borders of your state.” There is as yet no independent evidence that Kabaeva, a former pro-Putin MP, is hiding in Switzerland, where she was rumoured to have previously given birth in the country. It adds: “We want to remind you that Alina Kabaeva is not only a woman who stained herself with an association with the Russian dictator, but also a criminal against humanity. “In particular, she was among the initiators of the draft law, which in Russia was called the “law of scoundrels” or “the law of Dima Yakovlev. “This shameful move deprived thousands of Russian orphans of the possibility of being adopted abroad. “Consequently, many applications already open at the time for the adoption of seriously ill children were canceled and applicants for qualied medical care simply died. “Alina Kabaeva, [then] a member of the State Duma [parliament], obediently approved any unconstitutional initiative of President Putin, which later became almost genocidal against the internal population of Russia.”  They call for the Swiss to “investigate very carefully the legal basis on which she is present in your country. It adds: “Please consider it especially against the backdrop of sanctions imposed on her as a top executive of Russian propaganda media. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted. “We also ask you to check the ‘cleanliness’ of the funds used for the purchase of real estate in Switzerland, of which this person uses. “We will seek justice in any way possible, andthe fact of corruption of inidual political officials of Switzerland is found out, which has allowed Alina Kabaeva to obtain citizenship bypassing all procedures, then we will ensure that this information isn’t kept a secret. “At times like this, filled with tremendous uncertainty, you must be severe with your actions and in regards to the beneficiaries of Putinaposs regime!“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer!” Separate reports suggest Kabaeva is not in Switzerland but at a hi-tech underground bunker in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. Political scientist Valery Solovey, , linked to the Telegram channel, said earlier this month: “In fact, it is not a bunker, but a whole underground city, equipped with the latest science and technology.” He warned: “I hope this means something to you  “That the President sends his family to this bunker.” In her only statement linked to the war, Kabaeva slammed the refusal to allow the Russian team to compete at the Beijing Paralympics.  “There has never been a more shameful page in the history of world sports,” she said. “They did not worry and did not remove from the competition any country that participated in the destruction of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. “But sports officials were very angry when Russia decided to protect the Donbas and Luhansk from the Nazis. She complained that Olympic officials “tried so hard to humiliate the Russians, banned our symbols, flag and anthem”. But still Russians succeeded due to the talent of our athletes. “Russia was, is and will be a great sports power - and you canapost do anything about it. Rumours first linked her romantically to Putin as long ago as  when she was a pro-Kremlin MP. Tabloid Express Gazeta recounted in May when she was still out of sight: “She literally vanished. “After the giving-birth-to-twins reports nothing was heard about Kabaeva, asshe had disappeared. “Alina is not giving interviews, nor attending social events, nor participating in any TV programmes. “One can only guess what is happening in her private le.” Putin - who in  announced his orce from we Lyudmila, a former Aeroflot stewardess - has previously said: I have a private le in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected.” He deplored those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into othersapos lives”. Kabaeva is on record as saying she had met a man who I love very much”, gushing: Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared. However the Russian media - including her own newspaper and TV group - throws no light on whether they are or were a couple. In  Kabaeva was temporarily banned from competing in rhythmic gymnastics after failing a doping test. A year earlier she had won gold at the  summer Olympics. Once regarded as Russia’s most eligible woman, the only other suitor she has been linked to by the media was a married Georgian policeman. This relationship petered out in  amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her le. She once posed almost nude for Maxim and was described as “full of sex” by a photographer. There have been many reports of her wearing a wedding ring, but no records of a marriage. She is reported to have a fleet of Maybach limousines at her disposal, and was seen surrounded by a squad of machine-gun toting security guards on visits to a Moscow cafe. Many Russians saw her as the reason for the breakup of Putin’s marriage to ex-first lady Lyudmila, , mother of his two adult daughters. The dictator of neighbouring Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko hinted that Putinaposs orce decision came about because Kabaeva put pressure on the president.

Putins government salary is just , a year and he is estimated to be worth bnVladimir Putins presidential palace alone boasts an amphitheater, underground hockey rink and private seaportByCurt DevineCasey TolanMajlie de Puy KampSamantha Mordi:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsIt is widely known that Russian president Vladimir Putin is one of the richest men on earth but how exactly does he amass - and maintain - his fortune  For a man estimated to be worth  billion, Putinaposs presidential palace alone boasts an amphitheatre, underground hockey rink and private seaport. The palace stands in contrast to the tiny -square-foot apartment Putin claims in his most recent financial disclosure. Experts say the palace symbolises an era of Putin pursuing a luxurious lestyle that he could never afford on his , government salary. There is a no-fly zone in the skies above the residence and a no-boating zone in the surrounding waters.However, working out the intricacies of Putinaposs wealth is a dficult task, CNN Business reports.Gary Kalman, the director of the US office of Transparency International said: It is extraordinarily dficult for law enforcement to try and aposfollow the moneyapos because at some point you are going to literally hit a brick wall. There is literally no paper trail.  It is believed that Putin is believed to have amassed a hidden fortune by such means earlier in his career. The -year-old has become less reliant on his wealthy benefactors over the years and has surrounded himself with government and military loyalists.Some Russia experts say it may make it more dficult to make Putin personally feel the sting of economic sanctions the US and its European allies have imposed to punish him for invading Ukraine.He is rumoured to own or have access to not only the Black Sea palace, but also a  million yacht, according to unconfirmed reports. The Kremlin has dismissed reports of Putinaposs purported hidden wealth. Maria Pevchikh, head of investigations Navalnyaposs Anti-Corruption Foundation said: He sees himself as a czar, as king of some sort. He has huge plans. He has the vision of him being a historical figure, being so powerful, so mighty, so important, and they invest a lot of money into this narrative. The assets tied to Putinaposs inner circle include an apartment in a Monaco luxury building overlooking the principalityaposs glitzy harbour. The fourth-floor flat was purchased in  for . million by a shell corporation called Brockville Development Ltd., a company registered in the British Virgin Islands.Russia has the largest amount of wealth hidden in offshore tax havens, both in terms of absolute volume - estimates peg it around  billion in  - and as a percentage of national GDP, according to a  report by the Atlantic Council. On average, % of world GDP is held offshore. However, in Russia, offshore wealth accounted for as much as % of GDP in , according to a  Journal of Public Economics research paper, the most recent estimate available. Experts say about a quarter of this dark money is indirectly controlled by Putin and his tight-knit circle of oligarchs and poses aserious national security threatto the United States.The Mueller report illustrated how Russian offshore accounts were used to interfere in the  election Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON RussiaRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As the country marks its th anniversary, a coalition of Jamaican politicians, business leaders, doctors and musicians have called in an open letter for the British monarchy to pay slavery reparations.The letter reads: We note with great concern your visit to our country Jamaica, during a period when we are still in the throes of a global pandemic and bracing for the full impact of another global crisis associated with the Russian  Ukraine war.We see no reason to celebrate  years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership, and that of her predecessors, has perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind. The group Advocates Network, a human rights coalition of Jamaican activists and equalities organisations, will stage a protest outside the British High Commission in Kingston at .am just hours before Prince William and Kate arrive.  Co-organiser of the protest Nora Blake told The Independent: “It is important as we turn  years old as an independent nation that we stand as “adults” on solid ethical, moral and human justice grounds to say to Britain, who was once our “parent”, that you have done wrong in enriching yourselves off of chattel slavery and colonialism. “Morally this requires an apology, and it is only just that reparations be made. “Many precedents have been set for this.  “Today we are setting the conversation of our future generations, for them to have something to build a brighter future.” Numbers willing to participate in the protest have not been confirmed but organisers say it is backed by  figures from a wide cross-section of industries including politics, business, the clergy and arts. Signatories also include iconic reggae artist Big Youth and Mike Henry - one of Jamaica’s longest-serving MPs.  Directly addressing Prince William, who with we Kate is undertaking the tour to firm up relations with the Caribbean realms and celebrate the Queen’s  years on the throne, the letter states: “We will not participate in your Platinum Jubilee celebration! It adds: We are of the view that an apology for British crimes against humanity, including but not limited to, the exploitation of the indigenous people of Jamaica, the transatlantic trafficking of Africans, the enslavement of Africans, indentureship and colonialisation, is necessary to begin a process of healing, forgiveness, reconciliation and compensation.”  In sync with Jamaica’s th independence later this year, the protest group has issued the royals with a -point breakdown detailing reasons why this is warranted. The apparent opposition in Jamaica comes after the tour began in controversial circumstances when opposition from villagers in Belize, who cited a range of issues including objections to the Cambridgesapos helicopter landing site, forced a royal trip to a farm on Sunday to be scrapped. It was replaced with a visit to a chocolate producer before the royals travelled to the cultural centre of the Garuna community in Hopkins.  The Cambridges are todaydue to visit stunning ancient Maya ruins deep in the heartland of Belize. William and Kate will be given a tour of the site and have the chance to take in Caana, or sky palace, which remains the tallest man-made structure in Belize. The duke visited Belize as a teenager in , when he reportedly learned jungle survival techniques with the Welsh Guards who were receiving training from the British Army Training Support Unit as part of Exercise Native Trail.  William was beginning a gap year before university at the time and while in the jungle, the then -year-old duke learned his A level results. The last engagement of the day will see the couple attend a reception hosted by the Governor-General of Belize at the Maya ruins at Cahal Pech, near San Ignacio. This special reception will be held in celebration of the Queenaposs Platinum and William will give a speech. During their first full day in Belize on Sunday, the couple toured a cocoa farm and danced during a cultural visit to a nearby village.

Now that heaposs invaded Ukraine in what has been widely criticised as an unjust war, the speculation continues to run re.Putin, , has been in the Kremlin since  and public statements about his health are few and far between. As the Ukraine war appears to be waging longer than Putin planned, more questions have arisen over his health, from a physical perspective to mental capacity. Any statements from the Kremlin have dismissed all claims - but theyaposve remained tight-lipped on Putinaposs health since the invasion began on February . Here are some of the signs that explain why many suspect the former KGB agent is ill. Is Vladimir Putin seriously ill   aposSteroidsapos Recent photos of Putin have appeared to show him with a more bloated face, which some suggest mean he might be under a steroid treatment for a condition. It has been speculated that steroids could be part of a treatment for potential back issues. The side effects of steroids include mood swings and behavioural changes. A high dose of steroids can even cause confusion or changes in thinking, according to Macmillan Cancer Support. The charity says: This can include having strange or frightening thoughts.Fiona Hill, the British former senior White House expert on Russia, told Politico : Putin’s not looking so great, he’s been rather puffy-faced. We know that he has complained about having back issues. Evenit’s not something worse than that, it could be that he’s taking high doses of steroids, or there may be something . There seems to be an urgency for this that may be also driven by personal factors. She added: He may have a sense that time is marching on - it’s  years , after all, and the likelihood after that kind of time of a Russian leader leaving voluntarily or through elections is pretty slim. Most leaders leave either like Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko thought that he might leave, as the result of massive protests, or they die in office. If those claims are true, former foreign secretary and medical doctor Lord Owen said taking steroids can make you more vulnerable to Covid.  Lord Owen told Times Radio: Look at his face, see how that has changed - he now has an oval face. People who said, oh, itaposs plastic surgery or Botox, I donapost believe that at all. Heaposs on either anabolic steroids as a bodybuilder - and heaposs very proud of his muscles and strips to the waist and everything like that - or heaposs on corticosteroids. If youaposre on these drugs, this gives you this face. It reduces your immunity and makes you more vulnerable to Covid.  He added: This man has been in complete isolation, quite extraordinary, wonapost see anybody, stays miles away, tremendous pressures. Which indicates heaposs on a steroid and probably, maybe, a combination of both. And we ought to fess up to it, that carries with it, particularly anabolic steroids, bodybuilders, aggressiveness that comes through. I think his personality has changed, but donapost believe heaposs mad. Heaposs a very clever and able, and somebody who you donapost want as an enemy, and heaposs ruthless. Cancer claimsPolitical scientist Valery Solovei has previously claimed Putin has cancer as well as symptoms of Parkinsonaposs Disease.He also claimed Putin underwent emergency surgery in February . In , Prof Solovei said of Putinaposs twin health traumas: “One is of psycho-neurological nature, the other is a cancer problem. “If anyone is interested in the exact diagnosis, Iaposm not a doctor, and I have no ethical right to reveal these problems. ”The second diagnosis is a lot, lot more dangerous than the first named diagnosis as Parkinson’s does not threaten physical state, but just limits public appearances. “But there is a fatal diagnosis.  “Based on this information people will be able to make a conclusion about his le horizon, which wouldn’t even require specialist medical education.” Parkinsonaposs speculation Last week, Putin held a pro-war rally in Moscow where many speculated he limped off stage. Footage of his limp added to growing speculation the leader may be suffering from Parkinson’s disease, which could be influencing his behaviour. And Prof Solovei isnapost the only one to speculate that Putin may have Parkinsonaposs. Sir Richard Dearlove, an ex-MI boss, has recently told GB news there is often a link between the disease and a “loss of restraint”.  Sir Dearlove, who headed up the secret service from  until , said: Maybe Putin’s behaviour - maybe his rationality - is prejudiced or compromised by illness. The best explanation, that we don’t know whether it’s correct or not, is that he may have Parkinson’s. That certainly I’ve heard from several neurologists who say that loss of restraint, psychosis, are very common Parkinson’s symptoms.  Neurological concerns Marco Rubio, a US senator and senior Senate Intelligence Committee member, recently speculated that somethingoff with the Kremlin boss.Mr Rubio told the: “I wish I could share more, but for now, I can say it’s pretty obvious to many that something is off with Putin.“He has always been a killer, but his problem now is dferent and signicant. Putin, he went on to add, “appears to have some neuro physiological health issues.” The Times reported Tatiana Stanovaya, of the political analysis firm R.Politik, saying: “Hehas withdrawn into himself a lot during the past two years.He has become distanced from the bureaucratic machinery, from the establishment, from the elite. He spends a lot of time alone stewing in his own fears and thoughts. Covid fears During Putinaposs recent meetings he can be seen sitting far away from others, leading some to speculate whether this is a power play - or whether he is terried of catching Covid. If previous claims about his health are true, he could be more vulnerable to the virus and it could explain his caution. However, Putinaposs attempts to stay far away from those he meets has not been consistent. In a recent meeting with French leader Emmanuel Macron, the two were seen sitting a few metres apart - and it looked ridiculous. It later transpired that Macron had refused to take a Covid test before meeting Putin over fears of supplying his DNA. Putin was then seen shaking hands with close ally Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko earlier this month - meaning his ally could have produced a negative Covid test before the meeting. Lukashenko recently told Japanese TV that Putin was in great health. He said: “The West, and you, should get this stupidity, this fiction out of your heads,” he told the interviewer. “Putin is absolutely fit, he’s in better shape than ever … This is a completely sane, healthy person, physically healthy – he’s an athlete.” “As they say here – he’ll catch a cold at all our funerals.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Macmillan Cancer SupportMIMarco RubioAleksandr LukashenkoLord OwenVladimir PutinPlastic surgeryParkinsons diseaseSteroids\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The hunt for the aposLemminkäinen Hoard’ is reaching its decade-long climax - and it is one of the largest and most valuable treasure troves in the world. Some , gemstones, including rubies, sapphires, emeralds and diamonds, have supposedly laid hidden in an underground temple near Helsinki for hundreds of years. Amateur archaeologists from at least five countries, including the UK, have vowed to assist “in any way possible” to find them. Several -carat gold le-size statues in human form are also thought to have been entombed within the labyrinthine Sibbosberg cave system in Sipoo, a town  miles east of Finlandaposs capital.At least , antiques dating back thousands of years are also thought to be inside. Until now, a -strong group of “penniless” friends have excavated the huge site alone, armed with little more than cheap buckets and spades. Over the last  years, members of the so-called ‘Temple Twelve’ have each dedicated up to six hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, removing hundreds of tonnes of rock and clay.  Their efforts hit the headlines last year when it was revealed they could be just metres away from reaching the fabled temple door. The Temple Twelve have since received thousands of enquiries from people wanting to join its ranks or to lend a hand. According to historian Carl Borgen, the group’s biographer and sole point of ‘outside’ contact, this “small army” of unpaid volunteers could start arriving on site within a matter of weeks in readiness for when digging resumes in spring. He said the extra helpers would “substantially” increase the Temple Twelve’s chances of reaching the jackpot,it exists, this year.  “The existence of an undiscovered hoard of this vast scale has, quite naturally, captured the public’s attention and generated unimaginable levels of support,” he said. “A small army of people from a iety of countries including the United States, the UK, Australia, Canada, France and Finland have been in touch askingand how they can help with the dig and with the multitude of preliminary activities. “If only a handful of those people turn up then the Twelve believe strongly that this season could be the big one and that the cave will finally give up her secrets, whatever they may be.”  The hoard’s alleged existence first emerged in  when the local landowner Ior Bock claimed that his family, one of the oldest in Scandinavia, were direct descendants of Lemminkäinen, a prominent figure in Finnish pagan mythology. He said the cave, which lies on his sprawling ancestral estate, was home to the fabled Lemminkäinen Temple where the collected treasures from countless generations of ancient Finnish pagans had been stored. Tens of thousands of jewels, ancient artefacts, and le-size gold statues of Lemminkäinen himself had been stashed in several interconnected chambers over thousands of years, he claimed. According to Bock, the temple entrance was sealed up with huge stone slabs in the th-Century to protect the treasures within from invading Swedish and Swiss armies.  His aged family line, the Boxström, had been keepers of the secret and s of the cave since then. Bock, who never married or had children, revealed the temple’s existence to The SKS Archives in Helsinki, which documents the oral and written cultural heritage of Finland, to ensure its untold story would not die with him. By , news of the so-called ‘Bock Saga’ had spread worldwide and the possibility of finding the temple’s entrance had attracted the attention of historians, corporate sponsors, and professional archaeologists. It also captured the imagination of amateur treasure hunters, who flocked to the site in search of gold and glory.  Among them was a group of  “like-minded strangers” who joined forces with Ior Bock to become the site’s first and only permanent, self-funded excavation team. Since that time, most of the original party have left or died, including Bock himself, who was murdered by a personal assistant in .Their number gradually dropped to  and has since been maintained with new members from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Holland, Germany, Australia, Russia, and the United States.The ‘Temple Twelve’, as they have become known, camp nearby and spend each summer hunting for proof that Bock’s claims of an undiscovered ancient civilisation were true.  No hard evidence of the hoard has yet been found, but the Temple Twelve believe they have the aposapostenacityaposapos and the necessary explosives to locate and remove the giant granite slabs from the temple door, which is said to lie ft below the surface and more than ft from the cave entrance. Using rudimentary tools including spades and buckets, the group has so far removed several four-tonne blocks from the cave’s entrance and have excavated around  tonnes of sediment below it. They now believe they could be just metres away from the fabled temple door.  The remaining sediment, and the granite slabs covering the temple door, could be removed within a matter of months thanks to a recent ‘donation’ of dynamite, they say.But the inclement Finnish weather means the digging season is confined to the summer months before the cave starts filling with freezing rainwater.The group pumps out more than .million litres of water annually at the start of every season. When digging resumes in May, the team is confident that they will reach the temple entrance –it exists.  Borgen, a friend of Bock and the world’s leading authority on the hoard, has been following ongoing excavations at the site for more than  years. He has been in regular contact with the group since excavations began in , and is one of only a handful of ‘outsiders’ they confide in. His book, Temporarily Insane, chronicles the Bock Saga and follows the fanatics—or ‘Bockists’—who have devoted their lives to finding its supposed treasure. He said the site, which is now owned by one of the members of the Temple Twelve, could yield its treasures by the summer, adding: “We’re entering the end game and,we win, the treasures to be found there will be unimaginable.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Treasure TroveGoldBanks\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#.

I’ve looked forward to this date since we entered and it’s what I’ve been working towards. My aim is to defend my gold,possible, but I want to see how well I can do and give him [his dad] a good run for his money.“I’ve made a few changes to my training, my bike and my run style slightly so we’ll see how that all pays off, but I love racing at Oulton Park, it’s a really nice track, a lovely atmosphere, it should be a really good day of racing.”Preparing to defend his M- British title, Leahn added: “This time around it’s at the beginning of the year so it’s going to be interesting, especially as the fields are much deeper this year which is great because that’s what it should be for a British Championships. But I’m going there to try and defend my title, I’ve got a taste for it now after last year and then it’s building up to the Worlds and Europeans later in the year.”Reflecting on the moment they shared on the podium together, Leahn said: “It was such a proud moment to see Dylan on the podium and to be able to share it with him made it even more special.“You are focused on your own race and your own effort, and it can be hard to work out who is in which age group when you’re racing, so until you cross the line you never really know where you’ve placed.“So, to find out I had won and then to see Dylan crossing the line to win his age group was a really nice feeling, especially having seen all the training and hard work he put in last year. It was a nice surprise to be driving home with two gold medals in the car.”.removeLast year’s championships was Dylan’s first standard distance duathlon and his first experience of a British Championships.“I had raced at Oulton Park earlier in the summer, so I knew the track and I really enjoyed racing there,” Dylan said. “I felt a lot more confident in October than at the race in June, but it was a whole new experience for me because it was across a distance I had never raced before.“It was a lot of unknowns, a lot of guess work, but it was an amazing feeling to cross the line and to be told you’re British champion. To be able to stand on the podium with my dad was amazing.”Last year saw Leahn claim world bronze at the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships in Spain. Later this year he will be back in Spain for the European Standard Distance Duathlon Championships in September, when he will be joined on the GB Age-Group Team by Dylan for the first time.“I’ve had the opportunity to travel and compete in dferent places and meet so many dferent people at races who I genuinely call friends, and now seeing the development and progression of Dylan within the sport is fantastic,” Leahn said.“When Dylan was youngerI was doing a long run, he would cycle alongside me and then at the weekend we would both run. Now we’ll do sessions together, we train together after Dylan comes home from school or at the weekend, and we also compete against each other at cross country. I’m so proud of him to see how he’s come from someone who used to follow me around on the bike to now I’m following him, and that’s purely down to his own effort and determination.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"information is key in kintyre","story":"Campbeltown-based Keeping it local CICis introducing the screens up and down the peninsula, including Tarbert and on the Isle of Gigha.A spokesperson for the community interest company said: #With the support of fantastic businesses all over we are able to provide up-to-date information on events, news, travel and destination areas to visit all around the area at the touch of a button.#The work we do is also supported by advertising on our screens while promoting your own business offerings.#The boards should be up and running by April, all being well.The aim of Keeping it local CIC is to support businesses, trades, services and events by collating information and bringing all that Kintyre has to offer under one roof # a one-stop-shop for the consumer and businesses.The Tarbert information boards are due to be located at One Fyne Deli and at The Gather restaurant."},{"url":null,"title":"island residents and friends have a happy 20th gigha day","story":"Celebrations were in full swing this week as residents on the Isle of Gigha marked  years of community ownership.After extensive community fundraising alongside securing grants and loans from Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the National Lottery, Gigha was purchased by the community for the sum of £m on March  .On this day the island was handed over to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trusta day that is marked on the island every year as #Gigha Day#.To commemorate this -year milestone all Gigha residents and key island stakeholders were invited to watch Gigha’s eldest female resident Ina McNeill raise the island flag on Tuesday.This was followed by a display from the pupils of Gigha Primary School and a performance by the Kintyre Schools Pipe Band, who made the journey over from Campbeltown to attend.The Isle of Gigha Hotel then welcomed the guests for refreshments and to view a display of island memorabilia and photographs from the past  years.Since the buyout the permanent population of the island has grown from around  up to  residents.This has been achieved through housing renovations and new affordable housing, coupled with increased economic development.Gigha has several businesses which support employment on the island and IGHT now employs  people across its office, maintenance team, Achamore Gardens, new campsite, marketing, and ranger service.This includes two apprentices who are contributing to the restoration of Achamore Gardens.The trust is managed by a board of voluntary directors who are elected by the membership to develop the assets of the island and take forward plans and projects for the community.IGHT  retains ownership of the majority of the built and land assets of the island, worth over £m.Since the buy-out in  IGHT has renovated  houses as part of an ongoing investment programme, sold  plots for private self-build development, developed four wind turbines which help fund development, installed moorings and pontoon facilities, successfully marketed Gigha’s tourism assets as well as working to protect and conserve Gigha’s heritage and environment.One of the trust’s biggest challenges has been managing its financial position.The trust’s debt levels increased to £.m in  after taking out loans to deliver housing renovations.This debt burden is now reduced to £,, which has been achieved through asset sales and income from its renewable and trading companies.The trust has a number of projects underway including a new campsite, km of new and upgraded path networks, on-site and online heritage interpretation, five new housing units, and a -year restoration plan for Achamore Gardens.The trust is actively trying to reduce the island#s carbon footprint through  e-bikes for hire from the activity centre and is also soon to install the island#s first electric vehicle charging point."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Its kirkyard gives testimony to the thriving trades that existed here, and the personal struggles and tragedies of families who lived in harsher times.The Witches Stone in Spott I heard once that a minister not so long ago oversaw the recording of the graves, many of which are now worn by the sea winds which sweep over this beautul but exposed place.One gravestone is so worn by the weather a hole has appeared in its centre. I stood by it and hoped that the story it once told had been caught before the words finally vanished.I showed Suu the jougs which hang at the entrance to the kirk: a metal collar attached to the wall by a chain.Here its victims would be chained up, humiliating them and exposing them to the judgement of other members of the community who deemed themselves morally superior, or at least hoped their own transgressions would never be discovered.It was the poor, of course, who were subject to such humiliations, and women in particular, not the rich and powerful men who made the rules they set for others.As we stood by the kirk, I told Suu the well-kent tale of the Rev John Kello, who was minister at Spott after the Reformation.A memorial to the women ly executed as witches Despite his pious pontications and apparent high moral standards, he murdered his poor long-suffering we Margaret because of greed. He then tried to make it look like suicide.The fact he stood in the kirk, giving a sermon on morality, holding the Bible with the same hands which he had used, just an hour before, to strangle his we to death, is breathtaking in its horror and hypocrisy.But actually at the heart of this crime is misogyny, a contempt and hatred of women, which was, and is, far from unusual.Kello was eventually caught out and confessed that is the unusual part of the story, not the murder. Women regularly died at the hands of partners and, despite changes and progress, they still do.The jougs were just part of that system of misogyny, a terror of humiliation that dangled before them as they went to church, a reminder that they had a place set for them by men they best not challenge.I took a photo of the jougs and accidentally caught Suu’s shadow as well.The image seemed symbolic of the many women history has forgotten, or didn’t even notice, who remain unnamed shadows in the events catalogued by self-important men.Further down the road, there is another place which shows the final societal conclusion of this perception of women: the Witches’ Stone.Jougs at Spott Parish Church It stands on a site where, it is said, women were horribly executed for the trumped-up crime of witchcraft as late as .There is no space here to get into the debate about which women actually met their end here, and when, and what the evidence tells us.There are times that historical pedantry is promoted on this issue, usually by men, which ignores the very real horror of these events.Suffice to say, this is a location that bears the memory,not all the names, of many women who were persecuted by a system and ideology which had misogyny at its heart.There are statistics, of course: , accused of witchcraft in Scotland, the vast majority women, with evidence that more than , were actually executed, many in or from East Lothian.The real number will be more, and even then statistics don’t tell even half the story.Many of those accused who managed to avoid being ‘worrit’ at the stake will still have had their lives ruined in so many ways. They will have lived with the vilication and suspicions.None of these women were guilty of being witches who had made a pact with the Devil.That was nonsense.They were mothers, healers, midwives, grandmothers, poor servants, old women, young women, usually poor women many were convicted on evidence we would now recognise as compassion and care for others.They were victims of the misogyny cast in the iron of the jougs. Their real crime was being a woman.That’s why I support the move by the Scottish Government to have a full legal pardon for all those who suffered from the insane brutality of the witch hunts. Men were victims too, but it was overwhelmingly women.It’s not just about historical justice, it’s about recognising that while, thankfully, times have changed a lot, they still haven’t changed enough.Misogyny isn’t historical, it’s very current and very real today, all over the world, as well as on our doorstep.That’s why a national monument would be a good idea too, in addition to recognising the local memorials such as the one at Spott, and in my home town of Prestonpans.They need to be made accessible too, not tucked away on a dangerous corner of a road where there is no safe place to stand and remember.And let’s stop calling the women witches, because they weren’t what they were accused of being.And as we commemorate their persecution, let’s also celebrate their role in society, their bravery, their talents and contributions."},{"url":null,"title":"schoolchildren-visit-scottish-parliament-first-time-since-pandemic-began","story":"Students visited Holyrood as part of the Scottish Parliament’s education visits programme to learn more about the work of MSPs – a trip that was not possible for almost two years due to coronavirus restrictions.Two Higher modern studies classes attended Holyrood last Tuesday and were met by Martin Whitfield and Brian Whittle, South Scotland MSPs.Mr Whitfield, who was previously East Lothian’s MP and a teacher at Dirleton Primary School, was delighted to welcome the pupils to the Capital.He said: “The suspension of public visits to Parliament has been one of many disappointing impacts of the pandemic over the last two years.“It was a pleasure to meet the Knox Academy students and answer some of their questions, and I look forward to welcoming many more young people from other local schools over the course of this parliamentary session.”S pupil Mara Popa described it as “an amazing experience for everyone” and said: “During this time, we were able to ask our MSPs questions about what an MSP does, committees that they are members of, and how they can hold the Government to account.”"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1997-1972-1922","story":"THE school bell was ringing for the last time for Dunbar Grammar School’s headteacher, reported the East Lothian Courier on March , .Will Collin today walks through the gates of Dunbar Grammar School for the last time as headteacher.After almost  years in the senior post, and five years before that as assistant head, he is taking early retirement at the age of .Explaining his decision, Mr Collin said: “I feel I am ready for retirement and putting my feet up.”Born and raised in Eyemouth, he began teaching maths and physics at the high school there in .Five years later he moved to Arbroath before coming to Dunbar as assistant headteacher in .Following an -month sojourn as the deputy head of Selkirk High School in the early s, he ed to Dunbar in .Looking back over a career spanning three decades at the school, Mr Collin, who lives with his we Val in Rosebery Place, said: “The best part of the job is working with young people.”...and  years agoVandals created ‘a reign of terror’, told the East Lothian Courier on March , .A wave of vandalism in East Lothian recently was likened to a “reign of terror” by a county official this week.He said damage amounting to almost £, had been done to a pavilion in Prestonpans.“We are fighting a losing battle,” said Mr George B.

That all has planning approval and work will proceed on site before the summer. However, a group of concerned parents were at the same time looking for a site to locate a skate park and pump track in Dunbar they did a presentation to the community council on their ideas. I have for the last several months been working with these parents and iniduals.We are aware that skateboarding and BMX bikes are now Olympic sports and the idea of linking these facilities with the fantastic sporting facilities we have at Hallhill developed into the idea of locating it on the land we have available at Lochend. We have been developing this idea and, along with the changing rooms, we feel that a community cafe would be fantastic for our young people when they use this area. It would provide some supervision for the area and provide toilets and refreshments for the people using the facility.We are all aware of the anti-social behaviour that has been taking place within our community. Our young people are currently using Lochend Woods at nights and over the weekends to meet up but have no supervision and are getting involved in anti-social behaviour. We see lots of complaints about our young people on social media and now all young people have been banned from using McDonald’s in the evenings. The situation will not improve and will become dangerous unless we do something to support them. We need to provide these young people somewhere they can meet up in a safe area along with some supervision.The outdoor activity can be used by anyone despite their age, sex or ability. I would expect to see adults and children using this facility at the same time along with some quality coaching in all activities. We are fortunate in Dunbar that many of our young people use skateboards, scooters, roller skates and bikes they will all benefit from using this facility. My hope is all our young people can feel this is a place they can come and feel safe and be involved, or just sit in the cafe with friends for a chat.As for the woodland, I am fully committed to doing everything I can to protect it and the wildle within it. We need to find a way of engaging with our young people to respect it and support the work we need to do protect it and its wildle.

That would be undemocratic.I trust Peter A Russell, since he backs the proposal, would apply the same supermajority to all proposals in the referendum – status quo, independence or “other”. But that won’t happen, and the whole nonsense just sounds like imperial rules from a century ago.I have the gravest doubts that a fair Scottish referendum can take place under the media rules proposed by the UN for “territories” Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by this Tory Government seeking independence. The media is entirely Anglo-centric and unionist. The BBC that operates in Scotland lacks the bandwidth, forum or journalistic quality to debate anything, never mind independence.As Margaret Thatcher stated, negotiations for independence should start when a majority of pro-independence MPs are elected from Scotland. That would also sideline a whole lot of angst and bitterness.GR Weir, Ochiltree.SNP FOCUSING ON WRONG ISSUESNICOLA Sturgeon would have us believe that she is in tune with what “the people of Scotland” want. Clearly not. Time after time, surveys show that on top of the majority not wanting separation from the rest of the UK, a clear majority do not want the Government to be wasting time, money and effort on preparing for a referendum. How many civil servants are tied up preparing the latest fictional release called a White Paper  Could they not be put to better use getting accommodation and support in place for our homeless and those in poverty as well as helping with the Ukrainian work Not on the First Minister’s watch. All she wants is the headlines and the photo opportunity of helping Ukrainian refugees and to keep dangling the carrot of a referendum just over the next hill. The Ukrainians deserve all the help they can get from the many countries around the world offering support. Our own most vulnerable deserve help too.Theresa May said it was not the time a few years ago, pre-Covid and pre-Ukraine. What will it take for Ms Sturgeon to get the message that she is focusing on the wrong issues Jane Lax, Aberlour.WHY HAND THE KEYS TO BRUSSELS DESPITE wars and energy crises your Letters Pages still contain many missives from both pro and anti-independence camps.There is almost no doubt now that the referendum proposed for  is a non-starter. If those who are massively in favour of independence will draw some breath and admit this then perhaps a more basic question can then be answered. Does independence mean what it says or is it inextricably linked to handing the keys and responsibilities to Brussels Calling for an independent Scotland is simply wrongthat independence is promptly given away. The very word \"independence\" ought to be the centre of the debate and, as such, the answers from the nationalist side must include solid solutions to the currency, debt, pensions, national bank, interest rates and borders issues, not wish lists.Europe comes later,at all, so membership is simply conjecture based upon how well Scotland doesindependent.

The number of innocent civilians murdered on his orders is now well into the thousands and will continue to grow so long as this war continues.Let us not forget that Russia was at no time threatened by Ukraine nor was ever likely to be this was simply an invasion to reclaim territory ly claimed by Putin to belong to Russia. He calls Zelenskyy a Nazi and seeks \"denazication\" yet it is Putin, like Hitler, who invaded another nation’s sovereign territory it is Putin, like Hitler, who is a dictator it is Putin, like Hitler, who has total disregard for human le. Yes, Putin is a war criminal all right, and should be convicted as such.But let’s back up a moment. President Nixon together with his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, in illegal direct defiance of Congress, indiscriminately bombed Cambodia and Laos, two countries not involved in the Vietnam War. They unfortunately just happened to be in the way. Half a million innocent civilians from each countrywere killed by bombs dropped from Bs with barely a word of protest that I can recall. Nixon is dead but Kissinger, now , still lives a le of contented luxury in the US. No retribution for him.Then there are George W Bush and Tony Blair, both partners in a \"coalition of the willing\" although in direct defiance of the unwilling majority of the population of the UK, who, on the flimsiest of pretexts, bombed and killed more than , innocent Iraqi civilians. For Mariupol in Ukraine read Fallujah in Iraq.Putin is a war criminal and must be held to accountKissinger, Bush, and Blairalso have civilian blood on their hands and should be arraigned immediately, not that that is likely to happen.A war criminal is a war criminal, a dead civilian is a dead civilian their provenance is irrelevant.Bob Buntin, Skelmorlie.UN AND NATO HAVE FAILED USOVER the last three weeks, the United Nations has shown itself to be an impotent and toothless organisation, serving solely as an elite members club for the well-paid representatives of national governments, whoseis to provide a mouthpiece of their respective governments on the world stage. Both the Security Council and the General Assembly have failed to achieve unanimous condemnation of Russia’s illegal war or the illegal targeting of civilian targets and hospitals.We are one minute before midnight on the path to World War Three, yet the UN has spectacularly failed to achieve its prime and founding objective of preventing war. Even the mighty Nato, the worlds strongest military force, has cowered in the face of Vladimir Putin’s expansionist war and its crimes against humanity.Surely now is the time to rethink the purpose and usefulness of these dysal and bureaucratic organisations that have failed Ukraine, failed democracy, and failed the world.Ian Forbes, Glasgow.FOLLY OF A NUCLEAR ARSENALWHEN there is a war on, its convenient to criticise the SNP-Greens alliance for their Nato- and nuclear-sceptic stance .Any rational person opposes nuclear weapons, especially those parked in Scotland’s backyard. The shared consequence of radioactive fallout are only too obvious from the  Chernobyl explosion.Russia wisely took back its Ukrainian-based weapons when pro-Nato independence was declared.The other eight nuclear countries are the US, the UK, France, Israel, India, Pakistan, China and North Korea with a collective total of , bombs. Only one of those countries has used such weapons on innocent civilians, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The US kindly shares its nuclear arsenal with other countries, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Turkey.It is a bit like saying the gun lobby acts as a deterrent for shooting incidents.Malcolm Macqueen, Fairlie.MASKS DID NOT DO THEIR JOBDAVID Clarkclaims that the current spike in Covid cases is due to people not wearing masks.

These should include training and recruitment, the availability of sub-contracting and supplier opportunities, and that it is intended to improve the economic, social or environmental well-being of the area.If no community benefits are sought in a contract, a statement must be published on justying the decision.When CMAL announced the Turkish shipyard firm as the preferred bidder no benefits to any Scottish community were listed.CMAL says that as the contract has not been officially awarded yet, it cannot provide any detail about the bid.Now it has emerged that CMAL has amassed £,. in overseas travel over the last five years. It was spending an average of £. a month over six months during the Covid pandemic in  and  having previously forked out £. a month in the five years before the virus restrictons.Alba Party deputy Kenny MacAskill criticised the spend.“CMAL’s remit doesn’t extend beyond the Minch but they’ve run up almost £, in overseas travel since  and struggle to sail the seas they’re supposed to serve,\" he said. \"This even includes periods when foreign travel was precluded through lockdown. \"It’s bad enough that CMAL are giving contracts for ships that should be built in Scotland. But it’s adds salt to the wound that whilst the ships they’ve provided for remote communities lie idle, berthed or being repaired, they’re jetting around the globe.”Ministers have previously been warned that they may have acted unlawfully by failing to give nationalised shipbuilder Ferguson Marine a look in for a £m contract to create two new leline ferries to serve Islay.The Turkish yard won in front of four overseas companies to bid for the contract to build the two vessels - and excluded the Inverclyde shipbuilder.Finance secretary Kate Forbes has stated that in line with the Procurement ReformAct , bidders for the Islay procurement process were required to detail the community benefits they are able to offer within their response to the invitation to tender.Submissions from the four yards were evaluated including the responses to the community benefits section included within the original contract notice.Ferguson Marine which runs the last remaining shipyard on the lower Clyde was nationalised after it financially collapsed in August , amid soaring costs and delays to the construction of two leline island ferries.It came five years after tycoon Jim McColl first rescued the yard when it went bust.The delivery of new island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull , which were due online in the first half of , was found to be between four and five years late, with costs doubling to over £m.Earlier this year it emerged that the completion of the long-overdue ferries had been delayed again.The Islay route is already one of the busiest services for freight on the Clyde and Hebrides network, and CMAL says that the incoming ferries will support the island’s vital economic activity.The four shortlisted shipyards were to submit their technical and commercial proposals for the design and construction of the two vessels.The successful initial bids were from Damen Shipyard in Romania, Remontowa Shipbuilding in Poland, and Turkish shipyards Sefine Denizcilik Tersanecilik Turizm, and Cemre Marin Endustri.It was confirmed Ferguson Marine embarked in a bid for the contract through the initial Pre-Qualication Questionnaire process but failed to make the shortlist.A CMAL spokesman said that Mr MacAskills comment demonstrated a \"profound lack of understanding of CMAL’s role and the work we do to support Scotland’s ferry infrastructure – including the Northern Isles, beyond the Minch\".The spokesman added: “We have spent considerable time in past years searching the global second hand market for ferries to bring resilience to the fleet.

The damage to confidence and simple predictability of island le done in the last  years, against the stream of official rhetoric, is causing an unhappy reality to be faced by islanders that they do not have a sustainable future on the islands as long as the Scottish Government is failing to back them with real measures, rather than transparent political yack.How do we know island le is capsizing  Simple measurements. Static or falling incomes in an already marginal area while fuel costs head for £ per litre. Calmac ferry spaces set to a constant “unavailable”, months in advance, on its website. Residents working or moving away. Second-house ownersunable to find handy locals to clean their business premises.Much blame has been heaped on the weather for ferry failures, but this argument is as redundant as a rusting hulk in Rosyth or the Clyde. Ships in mid-Atlantic don’t suddenly sink when the weather blows up a bit but they would struggle to tie up in a decent swell. The example of Tiree and Coll shows that the investment in link spans has not been sufficient to assure service. These ports also need protected by sea walls to kill the swell and the undeniable savings all round that would come from the creation of a causeway across the Gunna Sound would mean that only one protected link span was needed.What is Ms Gilruth going to do Peter Isaacson, Hynish, Tiree.INQUIRY IS NOW OVERDUEI WRITE with reference to recent letters and articles and in particular Ferguson Marines inability to quanty a perceived further delay in delivery of MV Glen Sannox due to cables of inadequatebeing installed . Fergusons claim that these cables were installed pre-nationalisation is hardly credible.To have installed electrical cables at that stage, pre-launch, would have required cable supports in place, including structural penetrations and routings compatible with piping, ventilation and other services being defined. If such services were not in place, why would cables be On a previous occasion, the yard declared that the bulbous bow was reconstructed because \"it did not look nice\". I think Lloyds Register, the classication authority, might take a dferent view of this action.The yard can only claim delay in delivery due to force majeur or owners additional requirements and any self-inflicted wounds have to be absorbed in the yards delivery schedule. We are of course well beyond such niceties.A public inquiry is now long overdue, the only criteria for which is \"the existence of public concern\", but it must be convened by a Government minister. Some hope.Norman Brown, former director and general manager, Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd, Largs.WORRY OVER EV CHARGE POINTSIT was interesting to read Thomas GF Gray’s letterabout the lack of incentive for an energy supplier to provide a smart meter that actually works. Meanwhile it seems likely that a considerable number of consumers are about to lose grants for installing domestic charge points for electric vehicles, work which, under a UK Government scheme to encourage the move away from internal combustion engines, must be completed by the end of this month.Whether this situation is unique to those in the area where Scottish Power Energy Networks is the private monopoly supplier of infrastructure is not clear but what does seem sufficiently clear is that the lack of action or even contact from SPEN towards necessary upgrades to \"looped\" mains supplieswill prove expensive and frustrating for people who with reasonable expectations started the move to an emissions-free vehicle, sometimes many months ago.It is too long since the last storm for there to be a credible excuse that every engineer was needed for restoring damaged supply infrastructure. There is inevitable curiosity about whether this company, andso others, have had a financial incentive not to carry out timeous upgrades to their outdated domestic supply cables.William Patterson, East Linton.* I WAS interested in Thomas GF Grays experiences with Smart Metering Systems .Ive recently had two smart meters installed by this company. I am also a Shell Energy customer by default and have an In House Display unitwhich I was told would supply me with useful information. Its now been two weeks since the install and the IHD is \"still waiting\".Shell has informed me that the whole data-sharing process could be six weeks, which was contrary to the SMS installer, who said it would take around  hours.The IHD I hoped would alert my fellow household colleagues of the pain they were inflicting on me as the bill payer.Instead I foolishly installed the Shell app on my phone which works perfectly, but only I am aware of the pain. It s great you can watch your le force slowing ebbing away with every shower or cup of tea.From conversation with the SMS engineer I understand the smart meter readings go to a \"hub\" where the ious energy suppliers can access this data. The new IHDs get their data from this hub and this will facilitate the moving of customers between energy companies without having to change any equipment. It does seem to make senseit actually works.Anyway, good to know from Mr Gray that there is £ waiting on me once my patience dissolves.Iain McDermid, Alexandria.LET THERE BE LIGHTMAUREEN Sugden’s article on Daylight Saving Time in the US becoming permanentis very interesting.

That was only admitted by them because we got some correspondence from the PO management a couple of years ago which was leaked to the RMT. We produced those documents to ministers at the time. It’s grotesquely exploitative.Mark Dickinson, general secretary of Nautilus said: \"We need PO to be held to account legally.Theyve broken the law, let them feel the full force of UK law. If I break the law,I do anything to try and organise industrial action, you can be rest assured within minutes Ill never have writ served upon me. Yet it doesnt seem to apply to companies who blatantly break the law.\"And were not just talking about the redundancy issue. Weve got issues around, of course, the unfair dismissal issue.\"Weve got discrimination, with the wage rates that theyre offering to the agency crew that theyre trying to recruit who by the way, are leaving as fast as theyre joining.\"But theyre offering dferent wage rates and dferent roster arrangements to seafarers from Romania, from Latvia and from India and this is blatant discrimination. This is a legal morass that this company has created by their own failed, ridiculous strategy.\"In the UK, when  or more employees are proposed to be made dismissed, a -day consultation has to take place and collective redundancy rules apply and the business secretary has to be notied.PO say that the sacked staff were Jersey-contracted seafarers, which has raised questions over whether the depth of their legal employment rights in the UK.Three years ago, PO said it was shting the  registration of its UK vessels to Cyprus ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union, in part to keep its tax arrangements in the bloc.PO say they are compensating all  Jersey-contracted staff for lack of notice with enhanced severance packages and it is understood they have a deadline of Thursday to accept or reject them.Mr Dickinson said the staff deserve, salaries and conditions that reflect their commitment, to safety professionalism, and the time it takes them to get qualied.He told Sky News: \"Those legal options are coming while the company has set a deadline of Thursday for many of them to decide whether they want to take redundancy or they want to stay and work on on agency terms. So its going to be a dficult call for them and I dont Im glad Im not in their shoes.\"I wouldnt want to be in their shoes. Its a really dficult call. I dont know why the company is holding a gun to their head in terms of these redundancy terms. They should give them time to think and reflect about it but over the next few days our support for our members is going to have to focus on that very dficult decision and give them a clear pathway in terms of their options, take the redundancy or fight unfair dismissal, seeking protective awards.\"And thats going to have to be on a one to one basis because each member of ours, each officer will be will have a dferent context.\"RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: \"They [PO] should face the severest sanctions possible.\"We think they are importing Indian workers, Philippinos and Ukrainans at the moment to work on these vessels. That cannot be acceptable. We cannot dismiss our people to bring in other people on a discount rate.\"We were due to have a meeting with the business on Friday, then on Thursday they sacked all our members.\"PO, which has received over £m in UK government contracts and subsidies in two years suspended its services on Thursday before axing the staff.Services between Cairnryan to Larne, Dover to Calais, Dublin to Liverpool and Hull to Rotterdam would be out of action for between seven and  days.PO attributed the move to £ million of losses built up during the pandemic, although its owner, DP World, reported record profits this month of £.bn.An analysis revealed that PO Ferries received £.m in UK government contracts since December .They include a £.m deal in  to provide transport services between the key Scotland to Northern Ireland route – Cairnryan to Larne.The ferry company has also received more than £ million in public subsidies in a year to support jobs and services during the pandemic and there are calls for them to be refunded.Mr Turner said: \"What PO has accepted previously in meetings with me and the RMT, theyve said . an hour .\"That was only admitted by them because we got some correspondence from the PO management a couple of years ago which was leaked to the RMT.\"We produced those documents to ministers at the time. Its grotesquely exploitative.\"He added: “They can’t afford to get decent accommodation... so they get terrible multioccupancy-type accommodation in Hull, very often staying in hostels for about £ a night. Some have been known to pitch tents for a fortnight.”The International Transport Workers Federationand European Transport Workers Federationare calling on DP World to engage in meaningful dialogue with affiliates RMT and Nautilus International about PO Ferries future.\"These kinds of brutal shock tactics are reminiscent of the infamous Patrick dispute, that represents nothing more than an outmoded and discredited management style,\" said Paddy Crumlin, president of the ITF and chairman of ITFs Dockers Section.\"DP Worlds callous decision to sack and attack  hard-working seafarers represents a brutal attack on their dignity,\" said Mr Crumlin. \"In doing so, theyre breaching laws and failing to meet their own companys standards.\"PO sources said said wage figures cited were wholly inaccurate but could not clary what they were actually being paid. Protesters gathered outside the London offices of DP World on Monday afternoon, before marching to Parliament.Mr Lynch accused the logistics business of refusing to meet him and his counterparts at unions Nautilus and the TUC, who all attended the demonstration.He said: “This company are quite happy to sack our members by Zoom but they are not prepared to meet us face to face. That speaks volumes about their complete contempt for their staff.“We will continue to use political, industrial and public pressure to secure justice for the PO workforce and we are at Parliament today to step up that campaign.”Labour will force an emergency vote in the Commons on Monday afternoon demanding that the Government takes action to outlaw the so-called fire and rehire of staff, which involves making workers redundant before giving them their jobs back with worse terms and conditions.The party will also call on the Government to suspend contracts with DP World until the matter with PO Ferries is resolved.Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “What I want to see is those workers reinstated to their jobs, as they should neverbeen dismissed from them.“I want to see the Government take action here to ban this fire and rehire, which is the cause of this in the first place.“There’s a vote on that this afternoon. So, what I don’t want to hear is ministers, Government ministers, complaining about what PO have done.“Now they’ve got the chance to do something about it, vote this afternoon for reinstatement and banning fire and rehire.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bird-flu-h5n1-harmful-humans-free-range-eggs-not-available","story":"Restrictions and prevention measures are currently in place to stop the spread of the outbreak.Bird flu is an infectious type of influenza that spreads among birds and there are many dferent types. Some strains of bird flu can pass to humans but this is extremely rare. It usually requires very close contact with an infected bird so the risk to humans is considered very low.The Food Standards Agency has said that on the basis of the current scientic evidence, avian influenza also poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.Transmission from an infected bird to a human is very rare with fewer than five cases recorded in the UK. While previous cases were confirmed as the H strain, January  was the first time H has been detected in a human in the UK.The UKHSA said the risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low but said people should not touch sick or dead birds.Food Standards Scotland advises that avian influenzas pose a very low foodsafety risk for consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products, including eggs.The main symptoms of bird flu can appear very quickly and include: a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery, aching muscles, headache, and a cough or shortness of breathOther early symptoms may include: diarrhoea, sickness, stomach pain, chest pain, bleeding from the nose and gums, and conjunctivitisIt usually takes  to  days for the first symptoms to appear after youve been infected.There is no bird flu vaccine, and the seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against bird flu.If its thought you might have symptoms of bird flu youll be advised to stay at home, or youll be cared for in hospital in isolation from other patients.You may be given an antiviral medicine such as Tamlu or Relenza.Antiviral medicines help reduce the severity of the condition, prevent complications and improve the chances of survival.They are also sometimes given to people who have been in close contact with infected birds, or those who have had contact with infected people, for example family or healthcare staff.In March, three outbreaks of avian flu were identied among birds being kept at premises in Aberdeenshire and North Ayrshire prompting restrictions to be put in place for the surrounding area.The highly pathogenic avian influenza HN was found in a backyard flock of mixed poultry near Collieston, Aberdeenshire on March , and more recently at a premises near Strichen, Aberdeenshire on March , and Hessilhead Wildle Rescue Centre near at a premises in Beith, North Ayrshire on March .A km protection zone and a km surveillance zone have been established around the premises.In these areas, there will be restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure.Shoppers in the UK will no longer be able to buy free-range eggs from Monday.Birds have not been allowed outdoors since November due to fears of avian flu outbreaks.As a result, eggs sold in shops will be classied as “barn eggs” rather than free-range, the name for eggs produced by hens permanently indoors.Earlier this month, outbreaks of Avian flu were discovered in Aberdeenshire and Ayrshire.Other outbreaks of HN were identied in Dumfries and Galloway as well as Arbroath towards the end of .The Scottish Government advises bird keepers should ensure good biosecurity which improves the overall health and productivity of flocks by helping keep out poultry diseases and limiting the spread of disease in an outbreak.Housing measures are now in place across the UK to protect poultry and captive birds from avian influenza. Bird keepers must keep their birds indoors and follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread and eradicate the disease. More information can

Orkney Islands Council has announced that it will be installing card payment machines in its car parks, thanks to a boost from the Scottish Government.New ticket machines being installed in the coming weeks will offer contactless and chip and pin card payments.Work to install the machines – which will also accept coins – starts from Monday  March.The new machines are fully funded by the Scottish Government Place Based Investment Programme Capital Fund.All new machines are expected to be in place by the end of March.OIC’s roads support manager, Kenny Roy, said: “The existing machines require more and more maintenance now and are due to be replaced.“The option to pay by card has been a growing request over the past few years from our community and visitors, so we’re pleased to have secured funding from the Scottish Government to help us invest in that option.”Once works start, there will be periods during the installation of new power supplies and of the new machines, when parking in the car parks affected will be free of charge due to temporary unavailability of the machines.All other conditions of the car park order will continue to apply and be enforced, such as maximum stays and parking within marked bays.Drivers are being asked by the council to continue to use the bays in the short stay “pay and display” car parks for a maximum of three hours to ensure a turnover of available spaces. You should always check whether the machine is working and not assume free parking is available.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Fortunately, so far I didn’t get any infection but I hear stories .”Encouraging those who are eligible to come forward for their jab, he said: “Everybody must. In my age group, everybody must have it immediately. Do not delay. Delay means danger. You never know what will happen tomorrow.”Mr Jhalam, whose GP daughter was with him while he had his jab at Salt Hill Activity Centre, praised the NHS for its success with the vaccine rollout.He said: “It’s a wonderful thing, really, what’s happened . There’s only one organisation like the NHS.”The health service in England is inviting people to arrange a spring jab through the national booking service when it is their turn. This can be accessed online at nhs.uk covidvaccine or by calling .Rollout of the booster has already started in Wales and Scotland.Dr Nithya Nanda, clinical director for one of Slough’s primary care networks and a local GP, described the spring campaign as a “timely intervention” amid rising Covid cases.He said: “What we are seeing at the moment is increasing admissions to the hospital and increasing number of the cases.“And there is a iant of Omicron that has really made people think again of getting protected from Covid. And I do think and I’m hopeful that this is a timely intervention, especially for our at-risk patients.“I would urge everybody to come forward to get vaccinated, especially to protect themselves and their family from the increasing cases of Covid.”Dr Nanda said he is hopeful there will be a “good uptake” of fourth jabs. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Jhalam urged others not to delay getting their fourth Covid jabthey are offered it as part of the NHS’s new spring booster campaign England’s chief GP and deputy lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme, Dr Nikki Kanani, said: “The public have come forward time and again – protecting themselves and each other, and around five million people will be eligible to come forward throughout this spring campaign to get another booster.”It comes as the NHS in England has been told to prepare for a -week Covid campaign from September to December.At a minimum, care home residents and staff, frontline NHS and social care workers, people at risk due to underlying health conditions, and those aged  and over would be offered boosters.A “maximum scenario” would see all those aged  and over offered them.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid an autumn jab campaign will likely be needed to protect those most at risk of severe Covid.Health Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC Breakfast that the JCVI said “it’s possible there will be an autumn booster campaign, probably for those that are  and over, but they haven’t yet made a final recommendation on that”. vw,vw,px, px\"Health Secretary Sajid Javid He added that, despite rising Covid cases, the Government’s “level of concern hasn’t changed”, with numbers still “way below their peak”.He said: “And it’s also important for us – when we review this – to understand why they are rising and that is primarily due to the increased social mixing we’re seeing after the country’s opened up, but also the BA. sub-iant of Omicron, which we know is, on the one hand, more infectious but, on the other hand, we know that our vaccines work just as well against this sub-iant.“And so, taking all that into account, of course we keep the data under review, but there’s no particular cause for concern at this point.”Meanwhile, Cardf University announced doctors have successfully used vaccination to treat a patient with Covid- in what is thought to be the first instance of a jab being used for therapy.Ian Lester, , a dispensing optician from Pontypridd who has a rare genetic immunodeficiency, continued to test positive for Covid for seven and a half months after catching the virus.Medics from the Immunodeficiency Centre for Wales used two doses of the Pfizer vaccine to treat him and scientists from Cardf monitored the response as he got the all-clear."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-271-march-17-wordle-word-hints-todays-answer  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .

Throughout the club’s development over the last five years, we have placed a great emphasis on working for the betterment of our community.”The spokesman said that, in the past week, Larne FC has launched its post-Covid community engagement plans, which include mini soccer, after schools football, coffee club, over s exercise and wellbeing, and MEN United five-a-side. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read More‘Stock will be arriving in coming days’...

It is therefore not surprising that local fuel poverty charities now suggest four in  households are in fuel poverty.“This means those who were already in vulnerable situations are struggling even more and a new group of householders, who may have not had to worry about the price of energy before, will now be concerned about paying their bills.”Although the Consumer Council said it welcomes the £ support payments provided by the Department for Communities, the organisation called for further support in the Chancellors’ Spring Statement on Wednesday.Meanwhile, financial expert Martin Lewis said the time had come for government intervention.“I am out of tools to help people now,” he told BBC’s Sunday Morning programme.“I’ve been the Money Saving Expert since … I’ve been through the financial crash, I’ve been through Covid.

That speaks volumes about their complete contempt for their staff.“We will continue to use political, industrial and public pressure to secure justice for the PO workforce and we are at Parliament today to step up that campaign.”Labour will force an emergency vote in the Commons on Monday afternoon demanding that the Government takes action to outlaw the so-called fire and rehire of staff, which involves making workers redundant before giving them their jobs back with worse terms and conditions.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bcf-b-e-bde-adbca_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bcf-b-e-bde-adbca_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bcf-b-e-bde-adbca_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_bcf-b-e-bde-adbca_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Protests were held at ports after the staff were sacked PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueProtests were held at ports after the staff were sacked The party will also call on the Government to suspend contracts with DP World until the matter with PO Ferries is resolved.Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “What I want to see is those workers reinstated to their jobs, as they should neverbeen dismissed from them.“I want to see the Government take action here to ban this fire and rehire, which is the cause of this in the first place.“There’s a vote on that this afternoon.

Stock image Allan PrestonTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailStena Line has said it will put on extra ferry services between Northern Ireland and Scotland from Tuesday.The UK’s Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the news in the House of Commons, stating the company had “stepped up” after PO routes were suspended last week and that it would ease pressure on major supermarkets like Asda and Marks  Spencer.There was widespread outrage last week after PO made the sudden announcement that  workers had lost their jobs without warning.Read More‘Stock will be arriving in coming days’...

The company must sit down with workers and reconsider this action. pic bcXVntmwa— Rt Hon Grant Shapps MPMarch , Northern Ireland’s Economy Minister has also accused PO of “ripping up the employment rule book”.PO has said the company was forced to take immediate action to safeguard the future viability of the business and that affected staff would be receiving enhanced redundancy packages.Due to high demand we’ve added extra sailings on a number of our routes between Britain  Ireland: To and from Belfast  Cairnryan: Sunday March th  Monday March st @ :am To and from Belfast  Liverpool: Monday March st  Monday March th @ .am pic aWIdcmQ— Stena Line UKIEMarch , Mr Shapps told MPs that in both  during coronavirus and in  redundancies took place at PO in numbers in  larger than we#ve seen in the case of last Thursday. He added: However they properly consulted about those redundancies and they were made voluntary. He went on: My understanding is that officials were contacted, a very small number of officials I should say were contacted by PO management during the late afternoon, but they then wrote up a readout of that, which is I think the note that#s been widely circulated, and as mentioned my concern wasn#t really sparked til being at this despatch box when I started to hear about the way that that was being carried out, because in both  and in  voluntary redundancies had taken place in a way that you would expect. It was deeply concerning to see the footage of staff being forcibly removed from ferries, underlining a very cynical approach and confrontational nature of the entire operation, not at all what we#d seen in those previous two rounds.Most ReadPaul McKenna: Grieving widow tells of her last moments with DJ husband‘Stock will be arriving in coming days’...

Cadogan Enright mdash who is an enthusiastic supporter of the new trail mdash said ii took St Columbanus  years to complete the journey from Bangor to Bobbio in Italy and he travelled more than ,

Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been urged to do all it can to quickly deliver Newcastlersquos new multi-million pound leisure complex.The appeal was issued by the local authorityrsquos chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Fin tasic with formation of new angling club  ","story":"A NEW course angling club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

I know the partnership between the public, private and voluntary sectors which has developed here will moved forward to a successful conclusion and soon we will all see a major improvement in the appearance and le of Downpatrick, added the Minister.A new town centre plan was unveiled at the conference, together with a design guide to compliment the objectives of the Downpatrick conservation area.DUNDRUM ndash Pupils at two Dundrum schools, damaged by fire just before Christmas, have benefited from the Down Leisure Centrersquos annual fund-raising drive.Downshire and the Sacred Heart primary schools are the recipients of pound, which will go towards replacing equipment which was destroyed in two malicious fires in December.The money represents a record total of all leisure centre staff who organise a charity event each year. Past beneficiaries include Children in Need, the Ethiopian Appeal and local children who received toys.This yearrsquos total is a record figure for the centre staff who used their spare time to organised a sponsored swim for the schools.Both schools attended the centrersquos Schools Swimming Programme together and when the teachers and the young children related their plight to the swimming teachers the staff decided to help.The result was an organised sponsored swim with all the schools in the swimming programme taking part and all raising money. Down Councilrsquos community relations department gave full backing to the event by giving the centre facilities free of charge.BALLYNAHINCH ndash An offer of  per cent funding has been made by the Department of the Environment towards the costs of bringing the Fair Green in Ballynahinch into public ownership.Details of the offer to Down District Council were revealed this week by local SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady.He said: ldquoThe Department has also agreed, in principle, to grant aid the environmental improvement of the area, subject to the availability of funds.ldquoDown District Council is presently in discussion with consultants with regard to the preparation of a suitable scheme of environmental improvement.The South Down MP added: ldquoI would like to see this scheme proceed at Fair Green. This should be one component in an overall regeneration strategy for Ballynahich.NEWCASTLE ndash An ldquoexciting initiative in telecommunications, the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, was officially unveiled in Newcastle this week.The Burrendale STAR Project, which offers the only video conferencing facility in the Province, was launched on Monday morning with an impressive link up between two sites in Newcastle and another in England.The European Community sponsored project is run by Newcastle College of Further Education in conjunction with the Burrendale Hotel where the conferencing facility is based.It uses advanced fibre-optic telecommunications lines, which circle Northern Ireland, to allow conference organisers to visually link-up with similar facilities anywhere in the world.In means guest speakers no longer have to travel to a conference but need only go to the nearest video facility to take full part in a meeting being held thousands of miles away.So advanced is this form of communications system that plans to link up with Boston at Mondayrsquos launch had to be shelved when it was discovered the prominent American city does not yet have the appropriate technology.The Burrendale video conferencing facility, which was set up under STAR, which stands for Special Telecommunications Action for Regional Development, comprises two complete sets of video and sound equipment to enable the project to supply both ends of the video conferencing linknecessary.ARDGLASS ndash The Ardglass fishing fleet is prepared to co-operate fullya worthwhile decommissioning scheme is introduced for the industry, it has been stressed this week.As many as six vessels would be taken out of the Ardglass fleet of the Government provides a proper compensation scheme to help fishermen get out of the industry.The figures were given when South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, met with fishermensrsquo representatives in the village last week.The MP was urged by Mr Dick James, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producers Organisation, to apply the maximum political pressure on the issue.Mr James was joined at the meeting by some of those who would be prepared to take advantage of a decommissioning scheme, including Mr Frank Zych and Mr Rod Harding.The fishermen complained that the recent decommissioning scheme announced by the Government will not help reduce the UK fleet or with the conservation of fish stocks.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Bishopscourt residents are claiming that events surrounding Saturdayrsquos inaugural motor-cycle meeting had justied their protest campaign against racing at the former RAF base.Several local residents have complained bitterly about noise levels coming from the track and of non-stop traffic in the area throughout the day.They say the situation will get worse when meetings are held during the summer and they are calling on the Planning Service to refuse permission for further development of the track.One of the protestors, local farmer Joseph Fitzsimons said: ldquoSome of our worst fears were realised on Saturday.Mr Fitzsimons said continuous traffic on the main road to the airfield prevented him from moving some of his stock.ldquoWe had non-stop traffic from . am until pm. I had intended moving some sheep but it proved to be impossible, he remarked.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A discussion on possible sculpture schemes for the Downpatrick and Castlewellan areas will be held in Castlewellan library next Monday evening.Members of the Sculptorsrsquo Society of Ireland will be present at the meeting to give a brief slide show and talk on the range of possibilities for public sculptures and the procedures for commissioning them.Society members will also talk about how sculptors can be used for educational schemes involving adults and children, and there will be a display of work by sculptors form Down District.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Department of the Environment will put Killyleagh forward as a possible location for the new Strangford Lough Liaison Office, a Government Minister has said this week.Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, has told South Down SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, that the idea of siting the office in Killyleagh will be put forward by the Department, although a final decision is up to the new lough committee.Meanwhile, Down District Council has agreed to pay . per cent of the costs of the Strangford Lough liaison officer and office on condition that it is given equal representation to Ards Borough Council on the new management committee.

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in .

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe independent report, published by campaign group Keep Wales Tidy, is described as the first report of its kind since the start of the COVID- pandemic.  It recorded , littered face masks during the period and it said PPE litter, which was included in street cleanliness surveys for the first time, was present in eight per cent of streets. The ‘How Clean Are Our Streets’ report brings together results from thousands of street cleanliness surveys and is intended to give a ‘snapshot’ of litter and other environmental quality issues.  It only covers streets and doesn’t include parks and green spaces. The report found litter related to smoking is the most common type, found on . per cent of streets. While the report outlines the continued challenge of litter, and its prevalence across the nation, it also reported that recorded dog fouling is at its lowest level since street cleanliness surveys began in - and was present on just eight per cent of streets. Litter from confectionery, including sweet wrappers and crisp packets, was found on nearly half of streets and drinks litter remained at pre-pandemic levels and was found on  per cent of streets. Keep Wales Tidy has highlighted the results as supporting its calls for the implementation of Extended Producer Responsibilityin the UK which would place new duties on packaging producers to pay for the treatment or disposal of their goods. The charity, and other environmental groups, believe that would encourage producers to reduce waste and promote more sustainable product design as, it says, is in the case in many European countries. Keep Wales Tidy chief executive Lesley Jones said a public consultation has demonstrated support for such a scheme:  “The prevalence of littered packaging across Wales further strengthens the case for EPR. The responsibility for tackling litter does not rest solely with local authorities and the financial burden on the public purse must be reduced.” .removeWelsh Government deputy climate change minister Lee Water said it agrees with the principles of extended producer responsibility and will make an announcement in “due course”. The street surveys cover a six per cent sample of streets, selected at random, from full lists of adopted highways provided by each local authority.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

And I do think and I’m hopeful that this is a timely intervention, especially for our at-risk patients.“I would urge everybody to come forward to get vaccinated, especially to protect themselves and their family from the increasing cases of Covid.”Dr Nanda said he is hopeful there will be a “good uptake” of fourth jabs. vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Jhalam urged others not to delay getting their fourth Covid jabthey are offered it as part of the NHS’s new spring booster campaign England’s chief GP and deputy lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme, Dr Nikki Kanani, said: “The public have come forward time and again – protecting themselves and each other, and around five million people will be eligible to come forward throughout this spring campaign to get another booster.”It comes as the NHS in England has been told to prepare for a -week Covid campaign from September to December.At a minimum, care home residents and staff, frontline NHS and social care workers, people at risk due to underlying health conditions, and those aged  and over would be offered boosters.A “maximum scenario” would see all those aged  and over offered them.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid an autumn jab campaign will likely be needed to protect those most at risk of severe Covid.Health Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC Breakfast that the JCVI said “it’s possible there will be an autumn booster campaign, probably for those that are  and over, but they haven’t yet made a final recommendation on that”. vw,vw,px, px\"Health Secretary Sajid Javid He added that, despite rising Covid cases, the Government’s “level of concern hasn’t changed”, with numbers still “way below their peak”.He said: “And it’s also important for us – when we review this – to understand why they are rising and that is primarily due to the increased social mixing we’re seeing after the country’s opened up, but also the BA. sub-iant of Omicron, which we know is, on the one hand, more infectious but, on the other hand, we know that our vaccines work just as well against this sub-iant.“And so, taking all that into account, of course we keep the data under review, but there’s no particular cause for concern at this point.”Meanwhile, Cardf University announced doctors have successfully used vaccination to treat a patient with Covid- in what is thought to be the first instance of a jab being used for therapy.Ian Lester, , a dispensing optician from Pontypridd who has a rare genetic immunodeficiency, continued to test positive for Covid for seven and a half months after catching the virus.Medics from the Immunodeficiency Centre for Wales used two doses of the Pfizer vaccine to treat him and scientists from Cardf monitored the response as he got the all-clear..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Spring booster recipient tells others offered fourth Covid jab:  uDo not delay u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .
