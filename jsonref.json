Give me your thoughts in the comment box – who do you WANT to win, and who do you think WILL win? I’ve also kicked off my annual poll for the winner on Twitter if you fancy joining in – you can find me @heidistephens, so come and say hello and cast your vote. Also if you’re waiting to watch the smoking wreckage of a high emissions clunker that can’t quite accommodate a large family, our Prime Minister is up next. Then Top Gear is on afterwards. See you next week for the Grand Final, whoop whoop! Hx’It’s good to cry, it’s good to feel,’ says Rhys. ‘Strictly makes you feel things, you feel so much and sometimes that’s overwhelming.’ Cry it out, Rhys, we’re all here sobbing along with you. Honestly, we’re all going to need to rehydrate after next week’s Final. Bring Dioralyte. Rhys and Nancy take to the floor for their final dance, to ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ by Rick Astley. A dancefloor classic.Shirley would have saved them too, so that’s pretty conclusive.I think the thing I love about this most is the sheer joy on John’s face - he’s got nothing to lose and he’s giving it everything. If he goes out tonight, it’s on the highest of highs, but on the basis of that performance, I’d say he had the edge over Rhys.ANYWAY, Rhys is up first in the dance-off. I loved this Samba last night, it was great fun and definitely the best Samba we’ve seen this season. Rhys is the Latin god we’ve been waiting for, although I would say that this footwork isn’t quite as polished this time round. ‘Kai has ignited something inside me that I have not felt in years,’ says AJ. Bit early in the evening for that kind of thing, but I’m here for it anyway.As for John and Rhys, they were incredibly close on the leaderboard last night – John and Johannes scored 39 to Rhys and Nancy’s 38. So it’s hard to know which of them the judges will save – this could well come down to a Shirley vote. EEK.Ooh, time for a judges’ montage! ‘Craig, you are obsessed with me we knoooow,’ from Motsi was one of my highlights. I’m not hugely surprised, but realistically being up against Rhys and Nancy is their only chance of staying. If it’s AJ and Kai in the dance off with them, JoJo will almost certainly be going home."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"John Feehan\u0026rsquos book charts effort to protect Offaly habitat and inherent bioersityStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donegal town dealing with mica if it was in dublin this would already be fixed","story":"Moville, on Donegal’s Inishowen peninsula, is among the worst affected areas in the country for mica and for the students in Moville Community College, the subject is rarely far from their minds.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"five more cases of omicron variant reported in northern ireland","story":"Walk-in vaccinations are now available to those in Northern Ireland aged 30 and over and who are  at least three months out from their second vaccine dose. Photograph: GettyFive more cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have been reported in Northern Ireland, it was confirmed.It brings the total number of Omicron cases in the region to 10, the UK Health Security Agency said.Health minister Robin Swann has responded by announcing the immediate introduction of walk-in vaccination centres, providing booster jabs to anyone aged 30 and over who is at least three months out from their second vaccine dose.He said: “Given the scale of the potential threat posed by the Omicron variant, we are taking additional emergency measures to get as many booster doses as possible administered before the end of this month.“GPs, community pharmacies and Trust hubs will all have a central and vital role in making this happen.“It is also really important that people who are not yet vaccinated come forward for their first dose without delay.“I am really encouraged by the increased number of first doses delivered in recent weeks.”Trust hubs are extending their opening hours and days of operation with immediate effect and hundreds of additional vaccinators are being recruited.The deferral of some planned routine health service activity is also under consideration to free up further capacity.Mr Swann added: “It must be emphasised that we cannot rely solely on the booster programme to combat Omicron.“We all have a vital role to play in not spreading the virus. We need to keep making safer choices in our daily lives and to regularly use lateral flow tests to help protect each other.”Mr Swann has urged people to be patient in the event of queues at vaccination centres.Meanwhile, the Department of Health announced three further deaths from the virus.Sunday brought an additional 1,548 confirmed cases of the disease.There were 326 Covid-19 patients in hospitals on Sunday, with 30 of those in intensive care units.To date there have been 3,203,049 vaccines administered in total.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s Covid certification system will become legally enforceable in the hospitality sector, including for licensed premises and large events, from Monday.The system was introduced a fortnight ago, but businesses were granted a two-week grace period to implement the measures.Customers will need to show proof of vaccination, a negative lateral flow test result or proof of previous infection for entry.The Department of Health said: “People attending a range of venues including licensed pubsrestaurants, nightclubs, cinemas and theatres, and larger indoor and outdoor events such as concerts or large sporting events, are required to show staff their Covid status.” — PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warming"},{"url":null,"title":"welcome meme party internet skewered no 10 non event","story":"Two-thirds of the British public now say they have a bad opinion of Boris Johnson, according to the latest polling by YouGov. Which can only mean the other third have not been paying attention. Just to bring you up to speed, in case you fall into that category: the Prime Minister knew absolutely nothing about a Christmas party that definitely didn’t happen in Downing Street on December 18 last year.“How could it have happened when Christmas parties weren’t allowed due to Covid?” I hear you cry. Well, quite, that is precisely why it didn’t. Just as Owen Patterson did not commit any breaches of lobbying rules and just as Bill Clinton did not have sexual relations with that woman. Nothing whatsoever to see here. Just a nice baby girl, born to Johnson’s wife Carrie this week. Can’t we just focus on that?But here’s the curious part: although this party didn’t take place, Allegra Stratton, Johnson’s former press secretary, was filmed laughing about it anyway in a video that was leaked to ITV News. Which was somewhat unfortunate for all those who had insisted it never took place. Obviously Stratton had to resign from her current job, for laughing about a party that didn’t happen. The country, meanwhile, has kept itself busy sharing jokes and memes about what has inevitably now been called Christmas partygate. One wag on Twitter suggested Labour refer to the Tories from here on in as simply “The Christmas Party.” Another said of Johnson’s apparent non-attendance at the party that didn’t take place:Yes, it has been a rich seam to mine, and if we didn’t laugh we’d be crying as we asked ourselves in disbelief how a man who seemed so trustworthy at the outset, so clearly guided by a strict moral code, could have let us down so badly. I’m talking about Dominic Cummings, by the way, who has been sticking the knife in with contributions like this one below, which doesn’t seem in the Christmas spirit at all, since he seems to be implying these non-existent parties actually happened:The public has drawn its own conclusions on the matter. They firmly believe Johnson, as should we all:Some even expressed their support by comparing him to their favourite television comedians, such as Kathy Burke...But if, despite all the copper-bottomed assurances that no party or parties took place and no rules were broken, at least we know the very best officers have been assigned to the case.

Not the one by Edward Gibbon, but rather that by Evelyn Waugh. In particular I have been thinking of a strange scene at the end of the novel where Waugh suddenly introduces a serious note to his comedy.In his first novel Waugh already exercises his trademark gleeful malevolence towards the fate of his characters. All are picked up and spun through the most vicious cycles. But there is also a curious character, a sinister architect, who towards the novel’s close suddenly says something wise. Professor Silenus is watching a ride in an amusement park when Paul Pennyfeather comes upon him.Silenus explains the fairground attraction they are watching. For five francs the punters go into a room with tiers of seats, and in the centre is a great revolving floor that spins everyone around quickly.At first you sit down and watch the others. They are all trying to sit in the wheel, and they keep getting flung off, and that makes them laugh, and you laugh too. “It’s great fun.”Pennyfeather wonders whether this is much like life.“Oh, but it is,” says Silenus. “You see, the nearer you can get to the hub of the wheel the slower it is moving and the easier it is to stay on.“There’s generally someone in the centre who stands up and sometimes does a sort of dance. Often he’s paid by the management, though, or, at any rate, he’s allowed in free. Of course at the very centre there’s a point completely at rest, if one could only find it.”I’m sure I don’t need to extrapolate to readers why this passage has been on my mind. This week has included an especially horrible turn of the wheel. And the fairground attraction of Boris’s Number 10 suddenly seems to have lost all of its amusement value. It can even turn a party into a portion of the horrible, destructive game.Earlier this week the front pages blazed out images of the weeping Allegra Stratton, made to carry the can for Number 10.Stratton was hired away by Number 10 a year ago from her highly successful career in the media. She never even spent a day in the job she was hired to do, but was instead shunted aside (some say on the insistence of the Prime Minister’s wife) and given the booby prize of the Cop26 summit. Now she has been thrown off completely.When the footage was leaked showing her laughing with others at Number 10 over how to answer certain questions it was especially ugly because so many people in the media and politics had worked with Stratton, yet helped speed this cycle along.They pretended that Stratton had been laughing at the public, when she had been doing no such thing. But the outrage spin-cycle is so attractive. Everybody wants to be a part of, and make it go faster and faster until it throws them off in turn.To a great extent it is not just Number 10 but the whole political and media world in this country that is now stuck on this destructive ride with not a still point anywhere. Every hour we see another bizarre turn. Sometimes it takes out someone in politics.Sometimes it takes out someone in the media.Last week the BBC’s media editor Amol Rajan was clinging onto his job because some tweets of his from a decade earlier resurfaced. A few days later and the Prime Minister’s former girlfriend Jennifer Arcuri is being sued by the broadcaster Andrew Neil. Sometimes the wheel throws off one person. Sometimes people manage to cling on. It is all very distracting, certainly.And that is what brings to mind the speech of Professor Silenus. He feels, indeed hopes, that he might be near the still point himself. But there is a problem with getting there. Professional men get in the way, he says. Worse is that “Lots of people just enjoy scrambling on and being whisked off and scrambling on again. How they all shriek and giggle! And then there are those who sit as far out as they can and hold on for dear life and enjoy that”.How that sums up much of Westminster today – MPs and hacks who just enjoy the game and enjoy holding on as others go to the wall. But in the process they forget why anybody would want to get into this game in the first place.You might say, as Silenus does, that “you needn’t get on it at all, if you don’t want to.” And that, at times, seems like the easier and more attractive option. Yet the ride this country is on is not an amusement.If our country is to succeed in the coming years we are going to have to build as well as destroy, to develop people as well as fling them off. To find still points as well as the amusement. But nobody seems to want to think of that, so on it goes.     More from NewsOne million booster vaccines a day in race to avoid new year lockdownOmicron Covid variant Q\u0026ampA: How the symptoms differ and what protection vaccines offerAll adults told to get booster jab by New Year to protect \u0026#39our freedoms\u0026#39, announces Boris JohnsonBook your Covid booster vaccine in the afternoon ‘to get better protection’Covid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseUp to a quarter of No 10 ministerial aides on resignation watch ahead of Covid votesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"armed forces get new guidance use inclusive language","story":"The armed forces are to be given new guidance on “inclusive language” after the Defence Secretary said he is “unhappy” with the current advice.Military personnel from all three services had been told to avoid using phrases such as crippled with debt or blind drunk.The MoD said its Inclusive Language Guide 2021 was a “practical toolkit” to help servicemen and women understand why “certain words or use of language is hurtful or non-inclusive”.A senior defence source told the : The Defence Secretary and Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) have been clear that the UK armed forces must modernise to tackle the threats of the future. That includes our approach to our people who are critical to that task.“The Defence Secretary is unhappy with the current approach set out in the guide. A revised version will be published in the coming weeks.The guide will be taken down from the MoD website while changes are made.The guide, produced by the MoD\u0027s Diversity and Inclusion Directorate, denies being an attempt to police language or restrict your personal style of communication, but was created to help staff speak more powerfully, precisely and respectfully, according to the Mail on Sunday.It recommended avoiding phrases such as deaf to our pleas in case it offended the disabled.The 30-page pamphlet said the words woman and female “mean different things but are often used interchangeably”, adding: “Referring to women as females is perceived by many as reducing a woman to her reproductive parts and abilities.“Not all women are biologically female, and the conflation of ‘female’ to ‘woman’ erases gender nonconforming people and members of the trans community.”“The women in the platoon” is said to be a more inclusive phrase than “the females in the platoon”.The guide includes more inclusive ways to address disability, race, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation and social mobility.The MoD wants personnel to put the “person first” when speaking to others, only referencing characteristics when they are relevant and doing so in specific ways.References to race or disability should only be used when relevant to the context of any discussion, the guide states, adding it is important to ask how others self-identify.As far as possible neutral language should be used at all times.  The recommendations aim to be non-confrontational. The guide advises personnel challenging others on their language to be polite and prepared to “explain the logic” behind their views.Equally, those being challenged should not take it personally and should support junior peers to raise challenges with more senior colleagues, according to the guide.The  understands there are no plans to disband or redirect the MoD’s Diversity and Inclusion Directorate, which was responsible for the guide.The news came as the new CDS, Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, said the push for greater ersity in the military is not about being “woke”, but addressing the “woeful” lack of women and ethnic minorities in the forces.In his first speech in the post, Adm Radakin said: “This is not about wokefulness. It is about woefulness.

I think that we may need to go beyond them. But we\u0027ll need to watch carefully what happens with hospitalisations, she told the BBC.The last time the alert level was Level 4 was in February, when on the 25 Feb the alert level was downgraded from Level 5 to Level 4. During that time, the restrictions were as follows: However, no further restrictions than those currently imposed by Plan B have been announced. More from NewsOne million booster vaccines a day in race to avoid new year lockdownOmicron Covid variant Q\u0026ampA: How the symptoms differ and what protection vaccines offerAll adults told to get booster jab by New Year to protect \u0026#39our freedoms\u0026#39, announces Boris JohnsonBook your Covid booster vaccine in the afternoon ‘to get better protection’Up to a quarter of No 10 ministerial aides on resignation watch ahead of Covid votesA reputation as \u0026#39the Selfish Party\u0026#39 spells electoral doom for the ToriesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid booster jab rollout everything need know vaccine uk","story":"The target for giving every adult in England a booster jab has been brought forward by a month over fears of a tidal wave of the omicron variant.Boris Johnson, in a pre-recorded address to the nation on Sunday evening, warned that one million Britons needed to have the third dose every day, totalling to 18 million doses by the new year, in order to avoid any future restrictions on our freedoms.Following the announcement, thousands of people looked to book their booster vaccination online causing the NHS booking website to crash, while others faced lengthy queues. A statement on the website said: The NHS website is currently experiencing technical difficulties. We are working to resolve these issues. Thank you for your patience.Mr Johnson stressed that that being fully vaccinated is simply not enough to prevent the spread of omicron and that, without a lightning speed mass booster campaign, the NHS could be overwhelmed.The mission to administer millions of jabs by December 31 will see 42 military planning teams deployed across every health region, extra vaccine sites and mobile units, extended clinic opening hours to allow people to be jabbed around the clock and at weekends, and the training of thousands more volunteer vaccinators.The announcement comes as the UK Covid alert level was raised to Level 4, up from Level 3, following a rapid increase in the number of omicron cases being recorded.The UK Government will also support the devolved administrations to accelerate their own rollouts of third jabs.However, the acceleration will mean some NHS appointments would need to be postponed until the new year. Here is everything we know.Boris Johnson confirmed on Sunday the launch of the Omicron Emergency Boost, a national mission unlike anything we have done before in the vaccination programme.He announced that everybody aged 18 and over who had their second vaccine at least three months ago will have the chance to get their booster before the new year, bringing the previous target of boosting all adults by the end of January forward by an entire month, after the wait between the second and third doses being halved from six months to three. Bookings for those groups will open on Wednesday.This will require an extraordinary effort. And as we focus on boosters and make this new target achievable, it will mean some other appointments will need to be postponed until the new year, he said.But if we don’t do this now, the wave of Omicron could be so big that cancellations and disruptions, like the loss of cancer appointments, would be even greater next year.It comes after Education Secretary and former vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi described the UK as in a race to get the coronavirus booster to eligible adults as quickly as possible.Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously said that people should not try to book their vaccination until they are invited to come forward by the NHS, but added: We are going to throw everything at it, to ensure that everyone eligible for that booster will be vaccinated within two months.He said temporary vaccination centres would be popping up like Christmas trees, with the military, pharmacies and GPs deployed to match the daily vaccination rate seen earlier this year. On Sunday, he confirmed that there will be 42 military planning teams deployed across every region, additional opening hours so clinics are open second days a week, and additional vaccine sites and mobile units.People are being encouraged to book their boosters on the NHS website, but this crashed immediately after Mr Johnson\u0027s announcement as thousands rushed to the site. Many have since reported lengthy delays as those eligible wait in a virtual queue to access the booking system.Professor Saul Faust, leader of a trial looking at the effectiveness of seven different boosters given after two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer jabs, says that anyone willing to answer this in certain terms is just “speculating”. “At this point we don’t know,” Prof Faust, professor of paediatric immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Southampton, explains. “No one can know at this stage whether we will need boosters every year.”He says that levels of immunity seen in people after a third dose was much higher than after the first two, adding that the vaccines elicited a broad T-cell response, a key part of the immune system, alongside antibodies. “Even though we don’t properly understand its relation to long-term immunity, the T-cell data is showing us that it does seem to be broader against all the variant strains, which gives us hope that a variant strain of the virus might be able to be handled – certainly for hospitalisation and death if not prevention of infection – by the current vaccines,” Prof Faust says.Prof Faust’s study, published in the Lancet, which looked at the AstraZeneca, PfizerBioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Janssen, Valneva and CureVac jabs, found that while all worked well as a third dose, some were more effective than others. “The RNA - Pfizer and Moderna - were very high, but there were also very effective boosts from Novavax, Janssen and AstraZeneca as well.”The vast majority of people will be offered the Pfizer or Moderna jabs and the small number of people who are ineligible for this type of jab will be offered AstraZeneca. As with the first vaccine round you won\u0027t be able to choose which vaccine you get so there\u0027s a chance you may receive a different brand of booster. A study by Oxford University found that mixing and matching vaccines can actually induce more immunity than having the same brand of jab.The flu jab needs to be reformulated every year because a different strain circulates each season. It’s an imperfect solution because scientists have to make an educated guess as to which strain is likely to be dominant – some years they miss the mark, meaning vaccine efficacy is as low as 10 per cent. It’s too early to say whether Covid jabs will have to undergo the same process. The vaccines we’re using at the moment were all developed to work against the original Wuhan or “wild” variant, and we know from the past year that they’re effective against alpha and delta strains. But whether that means they’ll be effective against all future variants is another question.“No,” says Prof Faust. “People need to have boosters as quickly as they can.” Scientists at the UK Health Security Agency are currently looking at samples from Prof Faust’s study to see how well the omicron variant can be neutralised by vaccines, so it might be that our current boosters are good enough. Levels of immunity in young people from the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines “are high,” he adds. In recent studies, booster doses have been found to provide 93 per cent protection against severe disease. At the moment, it is not known how well the jabs work against the new omicron variant, and there may be a level of “mismatch” between vaccine and variant. However, scientists believe that the jabs are still likely to prevent severe disease. Similarly, analysis by the UKHSA has found that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines provide much lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection with omicron compared with delta.But the UKHSA said a booster dose gives around 70 per cent to 75 per cent protection against symptomatic infection with omicron, as it urged people to have their boosters.There are several trials underway that are testing vaccines that work against multiple variants – to remove the need to tweak a vaccine every year. But scientists don’t know how long immunity from these “variant-busting” vaccines will last, so an annual top up may still be required. GPs, pharmacies, hospitals and even the military have been roped into this “Great British vaccination effort,” as the Prime Minister described it. GPs have already been told they can drop routine checks for the over 75s in a bid to speed up the roll out.Dr Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter, says that a booster campaign would be “good value for money”, but without proper funding and training it could overwhelm the health system. “We need to have a forward vision,” he adds. “This thing is not going away, and because it’s not going away we need to invest in our primary care networks and community pharmacists.” Paul Mainwood, an analyst tracking the UK’s vaccine rollout, added that the cost of the current programme “is negligible compared to the cost of a) a new lockdown, b) crashing NHS capacity in about two months.” There are now 3,000 vaccination sites across the country - more than double the number at the start of the year - while pop up clinics will make shots even more accessible. You can find your nearest walk-in clinic offering booster jabs using the NHS finder.The NHS has also been recruiting 10,000 paid vaccinators and also volunteers as the vaccination rollout expands again.As mentioned above, all over-18s will soon be able to book an appointment due to the omicron strain, but in future – when we know more about variants and immunity – it may be that only those over the age of 50 will be eligible, as they are with flu.While some have raised concerns that seemingly never-ending vaccinations could hit take-up, Dr Pankhania says that “in my many years of administering vaccines, I haven’t come across anyone saying they’re fed up after having too many jabs.” Much of the planet still does not have access to coronavirus vaccines – only three per cent of shots rolled out worldwide have been administered in Africa, for instance. Many experts are concerned that the current scramble will only make things worse. “The only real way to truly end the threat of the virus here at home is to get first and second doses everywhere as fast as possible,” says Romilly Greenhill, UK Director at The ONE Campaign.“Unless the Government hears that wake-up call, there is a real danger that relying on booster jabs alone is simply a holding pattern rather than a genuine strategy to end the pandemic.”There have been 23,124 million booster jabs administered as of 11 December.The best day was reported as 10 November, where 532,238 boosters were given, closely followed by 11 December with 530,086. However, numbers have only gone above the half million mark on these two days.If this continued at the current seven day rate then in 20 days (data from 12 December until 31 December) 8,098,140 more people will have been jabbed.But, at current rate, to get 18,000,000 more people jabbed in the next three weeks at the seven day average rate of 404,907 that would take 44 days.And to get 18 million more people jabbed in 20 days (from 12 December until 31 December), 900,000 would need to be getting jabs every day.This would mean the programme would need to jab 2.2 times as many people per day to reach that target. More from NewsOne million booster vaccines a day in race to avoid new year lockdownOmicron Covid variant Q\u0026ampA: How the symptoms differ and what protection vaccines offerAll adults told to get booster jab by New Year to protect \u0026#39our freedoms\u0026#39, announces Boris JohnsonBook your Covid booster vaccine in the afternoon ‘to get better protection’Covid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseUp to a quarter of No 10 ministerial aides on resignation watch ahead of Covid votesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid travel restrictions haphazard disproportionate airlines","story":"Britain’s biggest airlines and tour operators have accused Boris Johnson of a “haphazard and disproportionate” approach to travel that has “unnecessarily disrupted” the Christmas holiday plans of millions of Britons.In a letter to the Prime Minister, they said that he has broken his promises to fix the “rip-off” PCR testing for travellers that exposes them to charges of up to £399 and presided over a quarantine hotel shambles where customers have been double booked and forced to pay twice.“We and our customers feel sincerely let down, having believed a more pragmatic, evidence-led approach to travel, in line with the rest of the world, had been achieved and agreed by all concerned just a few months ago,” said the chief executives of the airlines, among them British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair and Tui.“Instead, the layering of additional travel restrictions, introduced at short notice without consultation or discernible strategy, have disrupted Christmas plans and severely undermined customer sentiment just before the crucial Christmas and New Year booking season – up to 30 per cent of tickets are sold.”As revealed by The  last week, ministers are to consider plans this week to replace quarantine for red list countries with self-isolation at home for fully vaccinated travellers, but are still expected to retain testing pre-departure and on day two.However, the airlines want the Government to go further and scrap all testing for fully vaccinated travellers when it reviews the restrictions on December 20. At present, all arrivals have to do a lateral flow test before departure and a PCR swab on or before day two of their entry to the UK.They also called for an emergency aid package to bridge the industry through the crisis as the only major sector subject to enhanced restrictions and, in effect, prevented from trading.“As leaders of UK airlines, we are deeply concerned about the haphazard and disproportionate approach by government to travel restrictions following the emergence of the omicron variant,” they said.“Travel has been singled out with the introduction of disproportionate restrictions especially as there are no equivalent domestic measures. Further, pre-departure and upon-arrival testing clearly add very little value to our Covid protection, but unnecessarily disrupts Christmas for families and as well as businesses while severely damaging the UK travel industry.“Only the UK requires pre-departure and post-arrival PCR tests, irrespective of vaccination status. Whilst we have heard much talk of cracking down on the ‘rip-off’ testing regime – charging up to £399 for a PCR test – we’ve seen precious little action, despite repeated promises.”They added: “We have also seen immediate problems with red list arrivals, with many customers booking hotels which either were not ready or had been double booked, requiring them to rebook and pay again. Many people are stranded abroad through no fault of their own, due to a policy that cannot be executed properly.“We urgently request you meet with us, to understand the problems that we and our customers are now facing because of these measures, which the Transport Secretary himself admitted risked ‘killing off’ the travel industry. We urge you to act now to prevent this from happening.”The chief executives and managing directors that signed the letter were Andrew Flintham of Tui, Sean Doyle of British Airways, Eddie Wilson of Ryanair, Johan Lundgren of easyJet, Shai Weiss of Virgin Atlantic, Steve Heapy of Jet2, and Tim Alderslade of Airlines UK.A Government spokesman said: “Our top priority is protecting public health and we continue to keep our travel measures under review. We recognise that these temporary restrictions are challenging for the travel and tourism industry. “That is why businesses have been able to draw from an unprecedented £350 billion package of government support since the start of the pandemic, including around £8 billion for the air transport sector.”More from NewsOne million booster vaccines a day in race to avoid new year lockdownOmicron Covid variant Q\u0026ampA: How the symptoms differ and what protection vaccines offerAll adults told to get booster jab by New Year to protect \u0026#39our freedoms\u0026#39, announces Boris JohnsonBook your Covid booster vaccine in the afternoon ‘to get better protection’Covid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseUp to a quarter of No 10 ministerial aides on resignation watch ahead of Covid votesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid uk restrictions how affect christmas what rules 2021","story":"Boris Johnson held a press conference on December 8 at Downing Street to set out what measures the Government would take as it moved to its Covid Plan B in the wake of rapidly increasing cases of the omicron variant.The Prime Minister announced that work-from-home guidance would return, Covid passports would become mandatory in large venues and mask rules would be extended to more public places including cinemas.Mr Johnson addressed the nation once again on Sunday after the UK Covid alert was raised to Level 4. Although he did not impose any further restrictions, he warned of a tidal wave of omicron and said that from bitter experience the situation could deteriorate rapidly. His address suggested further restrictions may have to be enforced if the target to administer the third dose to one million people a day till the new year was not met. He said: Get boosted now for yourself, for your friends and your family. Get boosted now to protect jobs and livelihoods across this country. get boosted now to protect our NHS, our freedoms and our way of life. Here is everything we know so far about Plan B.As of December 10, face coverings became compulsory in most public indoor venues, such as cinemas, theatres and places of worship. However, there are exemptions for hospitality venues.The Prime Minister also advised “those who can” to work from home from December 13.And from December 15, the NHS Covid Pass will become mandatory for entry into nightclubs and settings where large crowds gather – including unseated indoor events with 500 or more attendees, unseated outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees and any event with 10,000 or more attendees.The Prime Minister said that the measures will be reviewed on January 5 and will automatically expire on January 26. The Prime Minister said that people should not cancel their Christmas parties or nativity plays. However, he suggested that they should take a Covid test before attending any festive events.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Boris Johnson said: On Christmas, the best way to ensure we have a Christmas as close to normal as possible is to get on with Plan B - irritating though it may be, it is not a lockdown, it is Plan B, it is what we set out a while back - and to get your booster and to get your jab.Asked about whether festive parties and nativity plays should be cancelled, he replied: No, in my view they should not.”They should follow the guidance, of course, but we are not saying we want kids to be taken out of school before the end of term - not that there is very long to go now - and we don\u0027t want nativity plays to be cancelled.We think that it is OK currently, on what we can see, to keep going with Christmas parties, but obviously everybody should exercise due caution, have ventilation, wash your hands, get a test before you go - (it is) a sensible thing to do to give everybody else at the party the confidence that they are going to be meeting someone who is not contagious.As of December 10, face coverings became compulsory in places of worship.However, the Prime Minister said that people who are “singing” are exempt from face masks, meaning those attending Christmas services are able to remove their face coverings when joining in carols. In England, face coverings are already required in shops and shopping centres.Hospitality settings are exempt from face mask rules meaning people attending Christmas meals in pubs or restaurants are not be required to wear a face covering.The Prime Minister did not announce any extra international travel restrictions at the Downing Street press conference. As such, the situation stands from the added travel restrictions that were already in place following the discovery of the omicron variant.Eleven African countries were added to the travel red list and a number of nations – including France, Portugal and Spain – are imposing stricter restrictions on arrivals from the UK.  Travel testing rules had also already been tightened: anyone travelling to the UK must now take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival, and self-isolate until they have received a negative result – regardless of the country they are travelling from, or their vaccination status. Additionally, all people aged 12 years and over must take a PCR or lateral flow test before they travel to England from abroad.This article is being kept updated with the latest news and Government guidance daily.More from NewsOne million booster vaccines a day in race to avoid new year lockdownOmicron Covid variant Q\u0026ampA: How the symptoms differ and what protection vaccines offerAll adults told to get booster jab by New Year to protect \u0026#39our freedoms\u0026#39, announces Boris JohnsonBook your Covid booster vaccine in the afternoon ‘to get better protection’Covid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseUp to a quarter of No 10 ministerial aides on resignation watch ahead of Covid votesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"defence boredom","story":"Some years ago, extravagant claims were made for the beneficial effects on children’s intelligence of listening to Mozart. A regime of Eine kleine Nachtmusik would, it was argued, foster improvements in cognitive ability. Happily for those on whom the principal effect of K 525 is an overwhelming desire to stick our fingers in our ears, the theory has been largely discredited. But in the light of recent developments at Ambridge, I find myself wondering what might be the long-term effects of daily exposure from infancy to The Archers’ theme tune, Barwick Green. That rollicking ditty was the leitmotif of my childhood teatimes these days I am an infrequent listener, but when I occasionally catch an episode I am struck by how seamlessly I am reabsorbed into the flow of rural fantasy.Partly this is because of the cyclical nature of events in Borsetshire, which recur with the inexorable regularity of the farming year. But the recent arrival of a new character, Trevor Fry, son of the late Bert, has brought a disturbing new aspect to the everyday story of farming folk. Bert was a formidable rustic bore but Trevor, played by the magnificent Julian Rhind-Tutt, takes tedium to another level. So virtuosic is his dullness that even that dim bulb, Tony Archer, is agonised by it. Here I encounter a problem, for I realise that my early exposure to Barwick Green set up an ineradicable Pavlovian reaction: the sound of it induces a reassuring sense of boredom a conviction that nothing dreadful will happen that however dire the development, Jill Archer will still put the kettle on. In interesting times such a these, a therapeutic mild ennui is a precious thing to cherish the prosaic is to remind ourselves of the value of the everyday. The last thing we need is The Archers, that great, interminable celebration of the quotidian, to go all meta on us and start pointing out its own ineffable dullness.A recent article in The Smithsonian Magazine records the continuing existence of whistled languages, still active in more than 80 cultures around the world. Developed for communication in dense forest or mountainous terrain, whistled languages are believed by scholars to contain clues to the earliest origins of speech.Which brings us to the Clangers, the small extraterrestrial knitted creatures created by the late Oliver Postgate for a BBC children’s series broadcast from 1969-72. The Clangers subsisted largely on volcanic soup and communicated in a whistled language with a wide and expressive vocabulary, easily understood by their young audience.Still, it turns out that perhaps the little viewers weren’t catching every nuance: Dan Postgate, Oliver Postgate’s son, is planning to publish his father’s Clangers scripts for the first time, and it seems that the Clangers, like the rest of us, were prone to profanity in moments of stress. The choleric Major Clanger had a certain barrack-room turn of phrase, and the soup dragon was also capable of a heated bubbling expletive. All of which makes perfect sense, when you come to think of it. For our prehistoric forebears, embarking on the earliest forms of communication, the most pressing matters must have been hunger, affection – and frustration. Exactly those, in fact, to which the Clangers gave such eloquent, whistled voice.More from NewsOne million booster vaccines a day in race to avoid new year lockdownOmicron Covid variant Q\u0026ampA: How the symptoms differ and what protection vaccines offerAll adults told to get booster jab by New Year to protect \u0026#39our freedoms\u0026#39, announces Boris JohnsonBook your Covid booster vaccine in the afternoon ‘to get better protection’Covid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you as omicron cases riseUp to a quarter of No 10 ministerial aides on resignation watch ahead of Covid votesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid plan d would see","story":"Covid Plan D would see pubs and restaurants on lockdownhospitals are overwhelmedThe Government is reportedly drawing up a Plan C and even a more draconian Plan D as Omicron Covid cases continue to rise across the country, sparking fears of a Christmas shutdownBoris Johnson implemented Plan B restrictions to tackle the Omicron iant Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByMatthew DreschReporter:,  Dec | commentsA Covid aposPlan Dapos could shut pubs and restaurants in England as new measures are reportedly being considered by the Government, according to Whitehall insiders.It comes after Boris Johnson implemented a raft of aposPlan Bapos restrictions to tackle the spread of the new highly transmissible Omicron iant.

Political staff and officials would frequently drink after work until the early hours of the morning, and order takeaway food to Ms Coffey’s office at the Department for Work and Pensions- while hospitality and office parties were banned under Covid regulations. While most DWP staff worked from home throughout the pandemic, a “core team” of her private office staff - who have desks in a small area outside her office door - continued to work from the departmental HQ, close to Westminster Abbey. At one such occasion during last year’s festive season, Ms Coffey handed out Christmas presents to her team. It comes as Whitehall was in ‘outright panic’ that more details of lockdown-breaking parties would surface in the coming days. The Mirror has been told aposgatheringsapos in Ms Coffeyaposs office throughout the pandemic were an open secret, with one source saying even during lockdown, there were parties all the time. Bottles of wine and beer were routinely found between staff members’ salads and sandwiches in fridges at the department, to be drunk at the informal, late-night soirees. A DWP insider said: “There is a constant flow of booze in the office.”  While the parties were not ‘organised’, staff meetings would often “evolve” into drinking, which would carry on until the early hours of the morning. Before the pandemic, Ms Coffey was reportedly the host of notorious late night karaoke sessions in the Houses of Parliament, which would regularly take place in her Commons office. The DWP told the Sunday Mirror there was “no karaoke” at the gatherings during the pandemic, but did not deny that late night drinking and mingling took place. A DWP spokesperson said: Throughout the pandemic, DWP officials have followed government guidance while continuing to deliver vital services for millions of people. “Staff worked from home where possible but a core team working directly to the Secretary of State regularly worked from the office, in accordance with the COVID- rules as they evolved. “The team regularly worked late into the evening and on a number of occasions they ate takeaway food and drank some alcohol. No karaoke took place. On one occasion close to Christmas, the Secretary of State gave gts to her core team, as she does every year.

Mr Zahawi could not guarantee that all schools will be open everywhere next term - but said he would do everything in my power to keep children in class.Ministers have repeatedly said that closing schools again would be a last resort after repeated lockdowns caused massive disruption to childrenaposs learning.Asked whether he could guarantee no schools would be shut, Mr Zahawi told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: We are absolutely working to make sure that all schools are open, that theyaposre protected. I will do everything in my power. We are still learning about this iant.  We know that a booster works. Get boosted, protect yourself, protect your community and letaposs get through this and transition this from pandemic to endemic. Last month, Mr Zahawi insisted that closing schools was absolutely the last possible option. But fears are mounting about the spread of the new Omicron iant, with reports of at least two outbreaks in schools.Mr Zahawi confirmed on Sunday that there are cases in hospital with Omicron and warned that tens of thousands of Brits could end up needing hospital treatment.The Education Secretary also failed to rule out extending the vaccine rollout to primary age children following reports health officials are gearing up to offer jabs to young kids. He said: There is no plan at the moment to vaccinate primary school children for the reason that the Joint Committee on Vaccinationis still looking at the evidence as to what level of protection it would offer.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyis expected to announce that jabs are safe for children, while the JCVI is examining whether to recommend vaccines for kids, according to the Sunday Times. The European Medicines Agency approved the Pfizer jab for  to -year-olds last month. The MHRA said: Pfizer has stated that they are applying to the MHRA for an extension to their Covid- vaccine authorisation that would allow use in five to -year-olds. Further details on the timing of this submission would be for Pfizer to provide. We are committed to providing safe, timely access to treatment for UK patients, and will continue to prioritise our Covid- evaluations. This includes any decision on use in under-s. Any such decision would be subject to our robust regulatory standards. In the meantime, we are looking at the data from other countries to ensure that when an application is received, we are making the best decision for children in the UK. It comes after a damning report by Ofsted found that nearly every child in England had fallen behind at school due to Covid. It warned that loneliness, boredom and misery had become endemic - and some children had developed physical and mental health problems due to the disruption. Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said there were children who sadly are safer in school than out of it as she warned that further shutdowns risk more cases like Arthur Lanbinjo-Hughes. The six-year-old was abused and killed at home in Solihull last year.

Why  No one knows. Or, at least, no one is willing to say. For as far back as anyone can remember, a stream of out-of-touch, often privately educated, Education Secretaries, have signed off on the idea that teaching student’s th century literature, at Level , is just what students need to secure them a decent job in the workplace. Students who don’t pass their GCSEs are forced to repeat what they’ve already failed at. Forced to engage with books written in a language they will never use. Trying to explain to young students who already feel like they have failed, why Jane Eyre is so important to them, is borderline abuse. At a time when young people are turning away from books and literature at an alarming rate, no one in government seems bothered or interested in providing students with something a little more relatable. Last week I had to face one such group. The futility and unfairness of it struck me mid lesson. I had no argument as to why they should engage with Dracula.  Why reading Stoker would be of use, interest, or benefit to them unless they had an express desire to go into further education. Which the vast majority don’t. Starting off a lesson with the words, ‘Today we are going to be looking at Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’ will mean within two minutes % of a GCSE class will have shut down. Do the powers that be think there is no other literature available to young people  Using contemporary texts by authors like Kit de Waal or Lisa McInerny, would at least give students and teachers a fighting chance. If educators were permitted to teach English using contemporary literature that told of the lives and challenges of iniduals who looked and sounded like the students they were teaching, on subjects like county lines, gangs and drugs, or any other aspect of st century teenage le, more students would engage. It’s what they are familiar with. What takes up much of their time. And using a language they use themselves exploring issues and situations they can identy with. A large section of the materials we currently use to teach our young students are entirely ineffective. In fact, they are worse than ineffective. Relying on these texts throws unnecessary, unhelpful barriers in the paths of students. It damages their already damaged faith in themselves and a system that is supposed to support, nurture, and encourage them. If you don’t believe me, ask them yourselves. @StephenTuffin is a lecturer in Swindon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyEducationSchoolsPoliticsChristmas partyGCSEsRochester and Strood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Senior MPs, including a Tory former health minister, gave the Prime Minister  days to answer questions about the guest list for the party on December , and details of a party alleged to have taken place in his flat on November . The cross-party group of MPs and peers - including Tory Dr Dan Poulter - today called on Cabinet Secretary Simon Case’s probe into the parties answer key questions within  days. Mr Case was last week tasked with investigating “the facts” of the party on December  in Number , details of which were first revealed by the Daily Mirror. The probe has since been extended to cover the party at the Department for Education, as well as a further gathering alleged to have taken place in the PM’s Downing Street flat on November . But Number  has resisted putting a timescale on his probe, with the PM only saying it would report back as quickly as possible. Today, in a letter coordinated by the All-Party Parliamentary Groupon Coronavirus, a cross-party group of MPs and Peers called on the PM to admit to “any other gatherings in Downing Street in contravention of Covid rules such as that alleged by Mr Cummings to have occurred on th November  ”And they demanded to know the guest list for the December  Christmas party, who organised and sanctioned it, and what knowledge of it the Prime Minister had at the time. It follows new polling, which suggests that % of people no longer trust the UK government to handle the nation’s pandemic response with % saying the scandal would negatively impact compliance with Covid rules. The polling, from from Best for Britain, the APPG’s Secretariat found % of  Tory voters thought it made people less likely to follow Covid restrictions - while % of Leave voters had also lost confidence in the government. Layla Moran MP, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus said: “We’ve heard first hand of the pain and loss people have endured during this pandemic. “To know that at the same time, those in Number  were partying and laughing about their rule-breaking, is absolutely sickening. “This investigation must be thorough. If the Prime Minister was aware of this party it is a resignation matter.” Naomi Smith, Chief Executive of Best for Britain said: “Our polling shows the real world dangers of a government that plays fast and loose with the trust of the British people. “This investigation cannot be a whitewash, with fewer people now expected to observe Covid guidelines, answering these questions is a matter of le and death.”  The letter in full Prime Minister,As the UK faces the new Omicron iant this winter, it has never been more important for the public to trust the UK Government’s response to the pandemic and observe all restrictions in place to save lives and protect the NHS. Therefore, the growing evidence supporting allegations of a social gathering at  Downing Street in contravention of Covid restrictions is deeply concerning.Your belated announcement of an internal investigation into this breach of Covid rules is welcome, but we remain concerned at the scope and the timeline of this investigation. For this reason we the undersigned ask you, to guarantee in writing that within the next  days, the investigation will provide answers to the following questions which are in the urgent public interest:Who attended the Downing Street party on th December  Who sanctioned and organised the event  Was the Prime Minister aware  And when did he become aware  Will the Prime Minister guarantee that all evidence is shared with the politan Police as soon as it becomes available  Were there any other gatherings in Downing Street in contravention of Covid rules such as that alleged by Mr Cummings to have occurred on th November  A Christmas party in Downing Street at a time when the public made enormous sacrices, including spending Christmas in isolation and far from sick and even dying relatives, would not only represent a flagrant breach of the rules, but a breach of the trust of the British people as well. At this crucial time in the pandemic, the public must have full trust in the UK Government’s ability to safeguard lives. It is vital that this investigation urgently restores public trust in the UK Government’s pandemic response and all public health measures in place.

And Tehran signalled two weeks ago it might accept the payment in Covid jabs and medicines which would count as humanitarian aid. In an exclusive interview Nazanin’s husband Richard Ratclfe said: “All countries need vaccines. If the offer was worth more than £million Iran could be interested. “Andwe settled this debt Nazainin could be released the next day. It would be an amazing Christmas present for her to be home.” But as things stand Richard and daughter, Gabriella, , will spend their sixth Christmas without Nazanin despite his  day hunger strike outside the Foreign Office last month. Richard added: “Nazanin has been very blue these past few days, as the realisation has hit her that we are drting again. “But Gabriella has had a happy time decorating the tree and helping me put up lights. After the intensity of the hunger strike, it is also nice to have some good times.”  Nazanin, , has been detained in Iran since April,  and was sentenced to five years over spying charges. She now faces another one year jail term. Britain claims she is being held hostage with other dual nationals as the two countries wrangle over money. Ministers admit the cash is owed for battle tanks never delivered but keep coming up with dferent excuses not to pay it. In March Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the UK’s refusal to cough up was “a stain on Britain’s honour”. Now he says the money can only be paid“a practicable and legally-viable means” can be found. Foreign Office minister Lord Zac Goldsmith said last month to pay would be ransom money. He added: “Payment of any money becomes payment for a hostage. That is not in our current, medium or long-term interests.” Richard said: “His comments were legally illiterate and irresponsible for the message it sent to Iran. “Ministers cannot throw out words like “hostage” and “ransom” when they just want to deflect Parliamentary scrutiny. “My fear is that the debt is also leverage for the UK side - using it to push Iran into the nuclear deal or something  - and Nazanin has become a bargaining chip for both sides.” Middle East minister James Cleverly refuses to talk about negotiations saying he “will not comment further as discussions are ongoing.” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had meetings with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on th November and another with his deputy Bagheri Kani three days later without any resolution.  In  Iran ordered , Chieftain battle tanks and  repair vehicles costing £million from Britain. Only  tanks were delivered before the  Iranian revolution overthrew the Shah and pitched the country into the hands of Islamic clerics and Britain banned arms sales. When new Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini asked for a £million refund to make up for the missing weaponry Britain refused to hand it over. Yet in  the international court in The Hague ordered Britain to repay the money which is still sitting in an independent trust in the UK. Iran now wants £million in interest which Britain will not pay either. Britain has argued the money cannot be repaid because Iran is under UN sanctions - yet that did not stop America coughing up a similar sum to release four American prisoners in . And former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: “We are a country that pays its debts.”Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe’s family have said she was repeatedly told that her arrest was linked with the debt that the UK owes. Richard has now been on two hunger strikes - the first two years ago outside London’s Iranian Embassy - but he is not about to embark on a third. He said: “They put a real strain on the family, as well as on my body.

Addressing the nation last night, the Prime Minister said the country was facing an emergency in our battle with the new iant - and two jabs will not be enough to protect people. He warned that Omicron could rip through an un-boosted population, overwhelming the NHS and leading to very many deaths. Covid restrictions are also being ramped up after scientists discovered the new Omicron iant is much more transmissible and spreading rapidly across the UK.It comes after Boris Johnson announced last week that England would move to the Governmentaposs Plan B measures. Epidemiologists fear the iant could cause , deaths by April and that the NHS could be overwhelmed as Omicron looks set to overtake Delta as the dominant iant within days. UK Health Security Agencyadviser Dr Susan Hopkins warned of a looming wave of infections - and said more measures may be needed. She said: Itaposs inevitable that weaposre going to see a big wave of infections. What we are not yet clear on, and which is what we are basically making sure people go out and get their vaccination for, is how much that will affect hospitals.  So, what do the latest Covid curbs mean for you  Hereaposs the latest. Working from home People in England are being urged to work from home where possible from today. This is aimed at reducing contacts. The furlough scheme has not ed, however, as no businesses are being shut down at this stage. The advice is to work from home aposwhere you canapos. Face masks New rules brought into force last Friday mean that anyone aged  or over must wear a face mask to enter a wide range of indoor venues. These include places such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys. The full list:community centres , youth centres, members clubs and social clubs libraries and public reading rooms shops public transport polling stations and premises used for the counting of votes places of worship crematoria and burial ground chapels visitor attractions and entertainment venuespublic areas in hotels and hostels indoor areas of sports stadiumsPubs, bars and nightclubs are exempt. There is also an exemption for singing, which applies to, for example, congregations and choirs. Technically, a person could avoid wearing a face mask by singing, but the Government has warned protestors attempting to abuse this rule will be stoped. Daily testing for Covid contacts  From tomorrow, double-jabbed people who come into contact with an infected person will be told to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days instead of isolating. The new advice applies to all cases of Covid, regardless of whether it is the Omicron iant or other strains. Unvaccinated adults must continue to self-isolate for  daysthey are a contact of someone with Covid.This means strict rules forcing people identied as close contacts of Omicron cases to isolate for  days are being scrapped. Care homes From Wednesday, there will be a new restriction on care home visits. Care home residents will be asked to pick three people to visit and one essential care worker. Covid passports From Wednesday, England could be facing the introduction of mandatory covid passes proving your vaccination status to enter some venues, including nightclubs.So a punter could have proof of double jabbed status or, under the new pass rules, a text message or email from the NHS showing a lateral flow result to get into a venue.Firms failing to check Covid passes properly may be fined £, and up to £, for repeat offences.But Boris Johnson is facing a major backlash to the plan as Tory backbenchers look set to vote against the plan. The PM may get the changes though parliament with Labour support but given he is under major pressure over the Christmas parties plan, the rules could be watered down.  So far, there are no limits on travel, household mixing and meeting groups of people. Downing Street has also rejected calls to put new restrictions on hospitality venues, so your Christmas party can still go ahead. What about a aposPlan Capos  Officially, there is no Plan C. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said on Friday there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already.But Omicron could change things, and Health Secretary Sajid Javid is under pressure to bring in more stringent measures before Christmas.Further measures could include hospitality check-ins, tougher isolation rules, face masks in all indoor venues and further vaccine passport rules.

Let’s assume the officer found groups of ying sizes, including one room with - people, participating in a Christmas quiz, with alcohol, which led to drinks later and mingling between offices. On  December , London was in Tier . Under paragraph  of Schedule  to the “All Tiers” regulations, no person could participate in a gathering indoors of two or more people. The officer would have considered possible exceptions. The first relevant one is a “permitted organised gathering”, under paragraph . But that could only workpeople participated alone or in household groups. That doesn’t seem to apply here. The second is that the gathering was “reasonably necessary for work” under paragraph . Maybe the civil servants would say that they needed the quiz for morale, or had to stay at work to run the government.  The officer might think: well, what is “reasonably necessary” for an office is a bit subjective. But the government told us exactly what they thought was “reasonably necessary for work” – their own guidance at the time said “you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity”. So that seems to exclude the work exception. The final question is whether No.  was somehow exempt from the Covid regulations. Lawyers have been debating this. I’m not convinced. I think the “crown property” exemption was about government buildings, not people. And I doubt that people could say they were doing their duties as crown servants and therefore exemptthey were doing things which the government had advised everyone not to do – and which broke the law. As for the Prime Minister – he appears to have been taking part in a social gathering indoors of more than one person, so may well have breached the regulations too.

That’s why I’m asking Mirror readers to get yourselves boosted as soon as you can – andyou haven’t had your first or second jab yet, it’s not too late to do that either! Three doses provide much better protection for you and the people around you against this new iant. Getting Britain boosted will help us protect the NHS as they approach their winter peak and it will also help us to minimise the disruption caused to people’s lives, livelihoods and liberties as a result of restrictions.  We need to pull out all the stops on this. The next few weeks are crucialwe are to get Britain boosted before the Omicron wave hits its peak. That’s why we support the Government’s ambition to get every adult vaccinated by the end of this month. We’ve asked them to put a rocket under the booster rollout and they’ve listened. It’s a big ambition. Vaccination on this scale has never been achieved before. But the NHS will be moving heaven and earth to pull it off and they’ll have Labour’s full support. Let’s make sure they know we’re all behind them. All of us have a part to play. The vaccine is safe and effective. I’ve had my first two jabs and I’ll be getting my booster this week.

The NHS is reportedly planning to roll out jabs to children as young as fivethe plan is approved by regulators.According to leaked documents, parental consent will be needed for kids aged between  and -years-old, and the environment in which they receive their jabs will need to be appropriate. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi did not rule out the move, saying that there was no plan at the moment to extend the jabs rollout to younger children. There have already been reports of cases of the new Omicron iant in schools, including one in Kent. Over the summer, SAGE experts warned that children were driving adult infections around the country.  In September, NHS England began rolling out vaccines for children aged between  and -years-old.Now, health officials could go even further and offer jabs to younger kids, with a decision likely to be made in the coming weeks, according to The Sunday Times.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyis expected to announce that jabs are safe for children, while the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis examining whether to recommend vaccines for kids. Mr Zahawi said the JCVI is still looking at the evidence as to what level of protection Covid- vaccines would offer primary school children. He told Sky Newsapos Trevor Phillips On Sunday: There is no plan at the moment to vaccinate primary school children for the reason that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationis still looking at the evidence as to what level of protection it would offer those children.  He added: The most important thing is to boost the most vulnerable - that is absolutely the priority. Mr Zahawi said he would do everything in my power to keep schools open - but could not rule out future closures. Asked to rule it out, he told the Andrew Marr Show: We are absolutely working to make sure that all schools are open, that theyaposre protected. I will do everything in my power. We are still learning about this iant. We know that a booster works. Get boosted, protect yourself, protect your community and letaposs get through this and transition this from pandemic to endemic. Under existing rules, vaccines are administered by the school immunisation service, with heads responsible for ensuring parents and children get information leaflets, consent forms and invitation letters. Parents are asked to give consent, although some older children are able to overrule their parentsthey are deemed competent to make their own decisions. This is unlikely to occur in very young children. Earlier this week, Professor John Edmunds, a member of Sage, called for jabs to be rolled out to five to -year-olds as soon as a licence is given. He said: This wave of the epidemic that we’ve had since June — the Delta wave — has been driven really by school-age children. Every child who is infected will expose an adult. They all live at home with adults. So from that, transmission can occur. The European Medicines Agencyapproved the use of the Pfizer vaccine for children aged - in May and for children aged five to  in November. An MHRA spokesperson said: Pfizer has stated that they are applying to the MHRA for an extension to their Covid- vaccine authorisation that would allow use in five to -year-olds. Further details on the timing of this submission would be for Pfizer to provide. We are committed to providing safe, timely access to treatment for UK patients, and will continue to prioritise our Covid- evaluations. This includes any decision on use in under-s. Any such decision would be subject to our robust regulatory standards. In the meantime, we are looking at the data from other countries to ensure that when an application is received, we are making the best decision for children in the UK. Due to the fast spread of the new Omicron iant, booster jabs will be available to millions more people in England this week.The national booking system will open to everyone aged  to  from Monday so they can make appointments to get a booster three months on from their second coronavirus jab.The move comes amid concerns the UK is facing a major wave of infections in January, with scientists warning up to , people could die of Covid- in the next five monthsfurther restrictions are not introduced. Experts from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicinesaid tougher measures may be needed to prevent Omicron from causing a high number of hospitalisations and deaths.The scientists, who advise the government, said the new Covid- strain could cause between , to , deaths in England over the next five months.

Ewelina Mejka, , and her husband Przemek, from Rugby, bought a home together after they got married but didn’t have the funds to purchase a new build.They bought a ‘doer upper’ three-bedroom property for £, and renovated the entire house with minimal help from professional tradesmen, reports CoventryLive. Ewelina, who works as a carer, told CoventryLive: We decided after we got married that we wanted to buy a house, but we didnapost get enough mortgage to buy a house where nothing  needed to be done. So we started to look for a house to renovate and thataposs how it all started. I love the boho style and fortunately my husband does too. Przemek took time off work to help with the renovation and the couple worked tirelessly from morning until late evenings to get the job done. First, Ewelina and Przemek ripped off all the old wallpaper in the rooms and replaced the floors, bathroom and entire kitchen. However, they hired workers to fit new windows and doors, and to install a boiler. They managed to get a brand new Ikea kitchen set for free and assembled it themselves.  Ewelina purchased most of the materials from Facebook marketplace and scoured the internet for bargains, cutting their costs dramatically. Their entire home renovation cost £, - raising the value of their home to £,. With the help of friends and family, the couple managed to finish the renovation work in just six weeks.Speaking about the process, Ewelina, said: My husband took time off from work and we both sat there from morning until evening. We were helped a lot by family and friends, without them it would not have been possible to finish renovating the whole house in six weeks. The entire house was renovated from top to bottom.  She added: I knew from the start that I wanted to decorate the house in this style. There are natural colours and accessories throughout the house. Ewelina found all the materials on the internet to be cheap and of good quality. Most of the new furniture was sourced from Facebook Marketplace. They put together the kitchen they bought from Ikea to cut the assembly cost in half. It is certainly not an easy job and you need a lot of free time to do it yourself, but you can save a lot of money this way. Many things can be bought on the internet for half the price than in a shop, but you have to start looking earlier. Sometimes furniture from Facebook marketplace only needs to be sanded and painted to look like new.

The national booking system will open to everyone aged  to  so that they can arrange to get the top-up jab three months on from their second dose.The extension of the NHS vaccine programme comes as scientists advising the Government warned that tougher Covid restrictions may be needed to prevent the Omicron iant causing anywhere between , to , deaths in England over the next five months.NHS England said the rollout has been accelerated in the face of Omicron, with data from UKHSA suggesting that booster doses give good protection against the new iant. People can make their booking two months on from their second dose - a month in advance of becoming eligible to receive the jab.  There are around . million people aged  to , and . million of those are eligible from Monday. Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS Covid- vaccination programme, said: Following the updated guidance from the JCVI, which shortened the interval between second and booster doses, NHS staff are redoubling their efforts to protect the public from the virus. The NHS vaccination programme, the biggest and most successful in health service history, will from tomorrow offer top-up jabs to everyone aged  and over three months from their second jab. With the emergence of the new iant and the rising case numbers, there has never been a more important time to get boosted. So, when itaposs your turn, come forward and book in. The vaccine programme has been designed and delivered by NHS staff but it could not have been rolled out so quickly without the support of our fabulous volunteers. So,you are interested in helping us, we have roles available - from marshalling car parks as a volunteer or taking on a paid role in admin or as a vaccinator, please do look at the opportunities available. You would be helping us to save lives. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: The Covid- booster programme is accelerating rapidly and more than  million people in the UK have already received their top-up, securing vital protection ahead of Christmas.This is our national mission - the most recent data shows boosters are the essential defence against Omicron and we are doing everything in our power to get jabs into arms as quickly as possible. We are now expanding the offer to over-s - so please come forward as quickly as possible to get boosted and help our country get ahead in this race with the iant. Experts from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine , who also sit on the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Group on Modellingor the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , used experimental data to look at how Omicron may transmit as the country heads into , and predicted a large wave of infections in January. On Friday, analysis by the UK Health Security Agencyfound that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines provided much lower levels of protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron compared with Delta. But the UKHSA said a booster dose gives around % to % protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron, as it urged people to have their boosters.

Anecdotal reports follow a large outbreak of the Covid iant in the UK.The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhas been part of a concerted effort to understand Omicron after it was classied as a iant of concern by the World Health Organisation last month, WalesOnline reports. The strain spreads far faster than previous iants, although so far few hospitalisations have been reported.In itsMorbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , researchers at the CDC have put forward a preliminary symptom profile for Omicron.The report states that a cough is the most common symptom, afflicting  percent of those infected. The authors of the CDC wrote: “Many of the first reported cases of Omicron iant infection appear to be mild, although as with all iants, a lag exists between infection and more severe outcomes.” “Symptoms would be expected to be milder in vaccinated persons and those with previous SARS-CoV- infection than in unvaccinated persons.  “Characteristics of the cases described in this report might also not be generalisable because case findings might be associated with inidual characteristics. The details of the report draw on the cases of  infections attributed to the Omicron strains. Only seven percent of subjects presented with ‘asymptomatic’ infection or ‘unknown’ symptoms, with  percent of cases deemed symptomatic. “Evenmost infections are mild, a highly transmissible iant could result in enough cases to overwhelm health systems,” wrote the authors where in the report. The report lists cough , fatigueand congestion or runny noseas the three most common symptoms. Shortness of breath , diarrhoeaand loss of taste or smellall featured at the bottom of the CDC’s list.

The display, which s every December, is expected to peak some time during the night of December  and will be visible into the early morning of December . Meteors are pieces of debris that enter Earthaposs atmosphere at speeds of up to km per second, vaporising and causing the streaks of light we call meteors. Geminids are very bright, moderately fast, and are unusual in being multi-coloured. They are mainly white, some yellow and a few green, red and blue, partly caused by the presence of traces of metals like sodium and calcium - the same elements that are used to make fireworks colourful.  The shower is known to produce more than  meteors an hour at its peak, although light pollution and other factors mean that in reality the actual number visible is far fewer. The source of the shooting stars is a stream of debris left behind by the asteroid  Phaethon, making this one of the only major showers not to originate from a comet.  Skygazers will be able to see the display with the naked eye so there is no need for binoculars or a telescope. It is best not to look directly at the radiant as this can limit the number of meteors people can see. Instead, people should look just to the side in a dark area of sky for a better chance of seeing the display.

In , in line with lockdown restrictions, they were forced to spend the day apart without their usual royal routines.If restrictions allow, The Firm will head to Sandringham later this month to join the Queen for her first Christmas without her beloved husband, Prince Philip.If they do, itaposs likely theyaposll all join together to attend the morning service at St Mary Magdalene - chatting to well-wishers afterwards. Prince George and Princess Charlotte joined their family for the church service for the first time in , stealing the show as they mingled crowds. However mum Kate admitted she had a huge regret from the special day - her outfit choice. Kate colour coordinated the familyaposs outfits as normal, matching her green accessories to her daughteraposs smart coat. While fans around the world loved their style, it turns out that Kate really regretted her outfit choice for the day, and even told one well-wisher she really shouldnapost have worn it. She looked gorgeous in a heavy grey Catherine Walker coat, with a green hat, bag and heels.But during a quick chat with -year-old fan Rachel Anvil, she admitted it was the wrong choice for the weather. Rachelaposs mother told the: Kate was talking to my daughter about clothes and how she was feeling too hot, she said aposI really shouldn’t have worn thisapos.I’m there talking to Charlotte about dolls and my daughter’s talking about fashion with Kate. It wasn’t fake it was a genuine discussion, it was about a minute but it was tailored to my daughter, it was like speaking to a friend. They are totally dferent with the public. Charlotte charmed well-wishers at the church service, chatting and smiling at her mumaposs side. She also stopped to hug Gemma Clark, who has cerebral palsy, in her wheelchair while holding a pink flamingo. The -year-old had travelled from Long Sutton in Lincolnshire with her family. She said: “It was amazing. I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. I’ve never seen the Royal Family before. She gave Kate some roses and Charlotte an inflatable flamingo and said she seemed pleased with the gt. “She said aposThank youapos, Ms Clark said, adding that the flamingo was called Felicity. “But Charlotte may call it whatever she likes now.” “It was a birthday present,” she explained. My sister bought me it for my birthday and I truthfully didnapost like it but we have adventures with her.” She said George and Charlotte were “brilliant”, adding: “This is my first time at Sandringham and I would love to do it again.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince GeorgeKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrincess CharlotteRoyal FamilyCerebral palsyAccessories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said winning the case at a civil court last month was perfect revision for his undergraduate law degreeJack Simm has won his first court case while still at university Image: Jack Simm   SWNSByBen TurnerChiara FiorilloNews Reporter:,  Dec | comments A law student has used his revision textbooks to sue his landlord over his unfit university halls, winning his first-ever court case at the age of .Jack Simm sued his landlord for an alleged breach of contract over his flat being like a construction site when he first moved in September . The undergraduate student, who was then a fresher and is now in his second year at the University of East Anglia , spent a year fighting the case and has now won. He said winning the case at a civil court last month was perfect revision for his law degree. Before his one-hour hearing, Jack referred to statutes and case law that he had learnt in his studies to build a -page legal claim for a refund on his deposit and first monthaposs rent - amounting to £. Jack successfully sued the company behind Velocity Student accommodation for breach of contract following a string of problems with the accommodation.  The student, who is also a rugby player at the university, said: Itaposs the best bit of revision Iaposve ever done. Funnily enough while the case was going on I was studying contract law so I flipped open the textbook and went over the notes.I was in a real situation with real consequences. I was thrown into the deep end.Winning shows that I can do it. Itaposs given me a massive confidence boost.Jack argued that his landlord was in breach of contract as the first-year accommodation in Norwich, Norfolk was not fit to be lived in. He claimed there was no heating or Wi-Fi, dust everywhere and builders still working in the accommodation, which Jack did not visit before arriving as he joined UEA through clearing just days before the start of term.  Jack left the halls and stopped paying his rent after just a week as the landlord didnapost recty the issues - and then started building his legal case. The undergrad from Newcastle said: We drove down and arrived at this place and it looked more like a construction site than a place to live. In my room the floor was covered in dust and there were loud noises from people hammering away. It was freezing at night with no heating. A smell was coming out of nowhere. We gave the landlord a week to sort everything out and at the end nothing had been resolved so I moved out and handed my keys in. Jack added: Other people are more lenient and they just get taken through the long grass [by complaining]. I thought aposIaposm not being taken for a fool.apos The most taxing part was making sure the case was tight. I kept tweaking the case right up until the court date. On November , Newcastle County Court ruled in Jackaposs favour and ordered that he be paid £ to cover his deposit and first monthaposs rent. The court also ordered the landlords to pay £ in court fees. The accommodation was developed by the Freedman Project LLP and managed by a company called Estateducation. The respondent in the case was Freedman Project LLP - landlord for the purpose-built student accommodation at , Velocity Student - , St. Mildreds Road.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of East AngliaEducationCourt case\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She warned her .million followers of some graphic content on her social media stories, showing images of a French bulldog having surgery to remove excess skin above their nose in order to breathe better. She wrote: “This is what you would be buying into. These breeders make themselves look like they care, make themselves look professional and make us think they are reputable. “If they are breeding Frenchies with excess skin, they are donating to this.”  In another image displaying a French bulldog with a surgical scar on their face, she implored dog lovers to do better. The -year-old wrote: “This is NOT cute. We need to do better. “A wrinkly snout may be ‘cute’ when they’re a puppy, but surgery and scars isn’t.” Olivia advised those looking to buy a French bulldog to look out for nice wide nostrils and least excess skin. She added: “I know these are things sometimes we miss and never think about, but we know now and need to stand together against this mutilation of the breed.”  TeamDogs is a community for dog lovers who want to get the most out of their relationship with their best pal.

The reality show star has often been vocal in educating people about the breed and their health issues - particularly when Reggie needed Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndromesurgery in .Following Reggie’s trip to the vets, she told her Twitter followers: “I’m so shocked at how many bulldog pug owners don’t know anything about the breed they own or in particular BOAS. It actually baffles me. We knew this day may come Reggie and we knew what it may cost. Brachycephalic breeds are not easy. Educate.”The warnings come as French bulldogs have rapidly grown in popularity over the course of the pandemic, and are one of the most common flat-faced brachycephalic breeds - which now account for a fth of the UK’s dogs. But public demand for Frenchies, and other flat-faced breeds – such as pugs, Boston terriers and English bulldogs – has led to a vicious cycle of overbreeding, causing many of them to be born with countless painful and le-limiting conditions.Leading pet charityBlue Crossrevealed that in the last two years alone, their vets have treated over , flat-faced pets, many of which were French bulldogs.Becky Thwaites, head of public affairs at Blue Cross, said: “Blue Cross are delighted to see Olivia Bowen using her  to raise awareness of the countless health issues that many flat-faced breeds like French bulldogs are suffering from, as a result of overbreeding due to public demand. “French bulldogs, alongside other flat-faced breeds like pugs and Persian cats – are highly sought after due to their quirky look and flat noses which are considered cute. Due to their fashionable status, prospective pet owners and breeders strive to attain an unnatural beauty standard, leading to a whole host of health issues, from breathing problems to eye disease, skin disease, heart conditions, spinal abnormalities and joint disease.  “At Blue Cross, we hope that by educating owners about the health issues associated with these pets the popularity and unrealistic beauty ideals these innocent pets face will be reduced, in favour of healthier breeding practices where the welfare of the animal, and not it’s appearance, will be front of mind. We never want anyone to feel blamed or shamed for sharing their lives with one of these pets - but we as a society must start doing what is best for the welfare of our four-legged friends.” Earlier this year, the charity launched their #EndTheTrend campaign, which asked brands to pledge to phase out the use of brachycephalic breeds in marketing material by .They installed mock advertisements in  high-profile train stations in London, including Charing Cross, London Bridge, St Pancras, Victoria and Waterloo, and launched a petition which members of the public can sign to urge their favourite brands to commit to this pledge.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She told the publication that the storeaposs busiest shopping times are usually between am and pm - so youaposll probably want to avoid this period when youaposre out Christmas shopping. Instead she believes the best time to get your hands on a must-have item is at Primarkaposs opening time on a weekday. Megan explained: In our store, we have deliveries Monday to Saturday so there is new stock nearly everyday. On Sundays, employees fill from the stock room so the shop floor is always stocked.  We get a delivery at am which is worked as soon as it comes off the lorry so the best time to come in would be as soon as the shop opens as that’s when the newest, latest stuff will be out in the full size range, she continued. Another useful tip from Megan is to avoid shopping at the weekendsyou can. My top tip is to go in early and avoid weekends, Saturdays especially. Alsoyouaposre in need of something, ask a staff member and they will advise you with what you want or show you where something is. She adds thatyou are going to shop during the busy times, remember many staff are working extra hours over Christmas and itaposs hard for them too.  When it comes to the Boxing Day sales, the same advice applies - shop early to avoid being disappointed.In terms of bargains, Megan says there will be reductions all over the store, but itaposs the ladieswear section where youaposll find the biggest price cuts. The employee added that this is the time to go to find something you missed out on when shopping previously, as they have more designated stock come in especially for the hectic Boxing Day Sales.Do you have a Primark story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The Duke of Sussex made the disclosure in an emotional letter to the family of a fallen comrade, who are fighting to have their son’s name on the national Armed Forces Memorial.The parents of decorated soldier Nathan Hunt had turned in ­desperation to the Duke of Sussex to get their son the lasting honour.Nathan served with Harry in Afghanistan in  but took his own le in  after suffering from severe mental health problems thought to be linked to his military service. In an official letter bearing his ­distinctive logo, Harry said he wishes he could help... “had I been in the same role I once was”.  Although Nathan was a serving warrant officer when he died, defence chiefs have ruled that his name should not be added to the memorial.The family told the Sunday People that Harry’s letter begins by thanking the family for writing to him and sharing what they were trying to achieve in memorialising Nathan’s le.They said Harry then writes that it was an honour to serve alongside many exceptional men and women, and that he was proud to have met Nathan as one of them. Harry adds: “I deeply empathise with what your family is going through and so wish I could assist formally, had I been in the same role I once was.” Before stepping down as a working royal and moving to Calornia with we Meghan, Harry was Captain General of the Royal Marines. After  years in the Army he launched the Invictus Games in , an international sporting event for ­injured personnel and veterans. The prince took part in expeditions with the Walking with the Wounded charity and followed in his mother’s footsteps by becoming a patron to the Halo Trust charity, which helps clear landmines. Last February it was announced that he would give up his position with the Royal Marines along with other honorary military titles. But he remains patron of Invictus and other good causes – and his public support for war-damaged veterans has resonated with many survivors of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts.  The family says Harry told them Nathan’s dedication and service is “indelible” and that he will forever remember Nathan as a hero. They say he wrote: “Grief can be a long and burdensome road. “Please know you and your family remain in my thoughts.”Derek Hunt, , and we Maria, , wrote to Harry last month explaining that the Ministry of Defence had twice refused to add Nathan’s name to the memorial in Staffordshire, despite his record for bravery.Harry and Meghan met the Hunts in  during a ceremony to mark the th anniversary of the First World War.  Harry hugged Maria at the event and he and Meghan said how sorry they were to lean of Nathan’s death.Derek, from Lincoln, told how he was deeply moved by Prince Harry ’s letter.He said: “I think the letter shows how much Harry cared about Nathan. He described Nathan as a hero and I think he is very sympathetic to our cause of trying to get Nathan’s name on the memorial. “I didn’t expect a response but after the article appeared in the Sunday People and we sent a letter, someone from his office contacted us and said that Harry would be responding. “I know he has had a tough time in the UK but I don’t care about any of that. You can see from the letter that Harry still cares about the armed forces andhe was able to he would use his influence to help get Nathan’s name on the memorial.” Colonel Richard Kemp, a former infantry commander, added: “Most retired soldiers and officers never forget their service and those they served alongside and will often do whatever they can to help each other after they have left the forces. “Prince Harry is no exception, as this letter shows. Harry deployed on two tours in Afghanistan and fought to do so against great pressure from the Government and resistance from within his own family. For this and his hard work for wounded soldiers – including creating the Invictus Games – he was deeply respected and admired by servicemen and veterans.” Nathan served alongside Harry in  in Helmand as part of a bomb search team in a desert reconnaissance unit while attached to the prince’s Household Cavalry regiment. He was a Royal Engineers Warrant Officer when he died aged . He was found hanged at home in Lincoln on January , . His parents insist Nathan should be included on the memorial, alongside , killed in action or from disease since the end of the Second World War.  Derek said: “Nathan risked his le almost every day in Afghanistan and his actions saved the lives of many soldiers. But it took a toll. He was mentally wounded and those wounds took his le. He was a casualty of war. “The very least the Ministry of Defence could do would be to add his name. Prince Harry appreciated the sacrice Nathan made, it’s just a shame that the MoD can’t do the same. I can’t understand why they are being so heartless. “I don’t want Nathan to be forgotten. I want his daughter to be able to visit the wall, see his name and say, ‘That’s my daddy’.” The names of three other soldiers who served in Afghanistan and died after taking their own lives are on the memorial in Staffordshire. A psychiatric report produced after Nathan died said he had experienced “traumatic exposure” in Afghanistan and had “some elements of PTSD.”  But defence chiefs have ruled that “on the balance of probabilities’ Nathan’s mental health and subsequent death was not linked to his  years of military service. During his six months in Afghanistan the soldier received a Mention in Dispatches. The citation for his award described him as “a superb example of leadership, professionalism and a fantastic ambassador to his corps.” The MoD said: “Every suicide is a tragedy and deeply felt within the defence community. Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of WO Nathan Hunt. “Careful consideration is given to each case and the decision not to include WO Hunt’s name on the Armed Forces Memorial does not detract from his service in the Army.” It added: “We are eternally grateful for his service.” Hero braved bombs peril When he served with Harry in , Nathan had one of the most dangerous jobs in the Army. His role was to search for home-made Taliban roadside bombs in Helmand. One wrong move could have resulted in death or serious injury. Then a Lance Sergeant, Nathan always insisted that he should be the main searcher because of his experience, even though others in his team were also trained to detect bombs.  During his six months in Afghanistan he found numerous homemade devices and carried out searches of roads and tracks while being watched and occasionally attacked by the Taliban. The citation for his Mention In Dispatches, reads: “Lance Sgt Hunt has shown exemplary behaviour and a very good example to all. “He demonstrates selfless commitment time and again, putting himself at greater risk to provide the security for the squadron in the face of a very lethal and hidden enemy.” During his  years of Army service, Nathan, a married father of one daughter, also completed tours of Iraq, Northern Ireland and Kosovo.  taken their lives since  Up to  soldiers and veterans are believed to have taken their own lives since . In reality the number of deaths is probably higher because no government body officially records the grim toll. That means no one knows why so many have killed themselves. Many of those who died were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and had been medically discharged from the Army after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Other veterans developed mental health conditions such as depression and severe anxiety.  Soldiers who served with distinction on the front line struggled to cope with le on civvy street. Many lost their jobs, watched their marriages crumble and turned to drink. It is not surprising that the regiments which suffered the highest casualties in Afghanistan – such as the Rles – also have the highest rates of suicide amongst veterans. The Sunday People began its Save Our Soldiers Campaign when it became clear that veterans with mental health problems were being failed by the Government. Although the access to mental health support for veterans has improved, the number of suicides continues to rise. So far this year at least  have died.  Former Army Warrant Officer Jim Wilde, a founder of Veterans United Against Suicide, said much more needs to be done to reduce suicide rates amongst veterans. He said: “There have been at least  deaths this year but the real number is probably far higher. Many were veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and went on to develop mental health issues. “The fact that the MoD has no idea how many veterans are taking their lives every year is shameful. “Once the size of the problem is known people can set about trying to find a solution. Until then many more members of the military community will take their own lives. “Sadly, this is a time of year when our losses increase due to a sense of isolation many veterans feel.” *If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Andrew is understood to have had “little or no discussion” with the Queen, Prince Charles or Prince William – despite Her Majesty paying his hefty legal fees. Sources say the Duke of York has been “less than forthcoming” over how he will battle allegations from Virginia Giuffre. Insiders suggest preparations have been coloured by reported infighting between Andrew’s UK solicitor Gary Bloxsome and his newly hired Hollywood hotshot lawyer Andrew Brettler, due to a “severe clash in personalities”. The Duke is accused of sexually assaulting Ms Giuffre on three occasions in , when she was allegedly trafficked by the late Jeffrey Epstein.  The claims come as the trial of his alleged fixer Ghislaine Maxwell continues in New York. Virginia, , is suing for damages in a separate action in the US. The Duke, , has always strongly denied any wrongdoing and vehemently denies the claims. He said in a  BBC interview: “I can absolutelycategorically tell you it never happened.” Andrew’s team must deliver final submissions on Monday. A judge will rule whether a trial is held. One impeccably placed source said: “Everyone from the very top has been left in the dark.

The seaside treat is a must for tourists wanting to sample the local cuisine but has received mixed reviews from US foodies who are often baffled by the combo. A string of online reviews described the battered delicacy as funky, soggy and frankly not as good as US copycats despite getting five star ratings from British diners.

He wrote on Tripadvisor: I canapost understand why this place has so many good reviews. The portion size is good and mushy peas ok. Thataposs about it. Chips were not cooked properly. Fish was very greasy and the batter was thick and stodgy and tasted funky. Really disappointed and wonapost be back.  This is contrary to recent local reviews praising the chippy for its fresh and tasty food and excellent service. TripAdvisor user TracyS was also unimpressed after taking US friends for fish and chips, this time venturing to the Michelin-starred Whitstable Oyster Company restaurant in Whitstable. She said the £. cod was overpriced and served with soggy, greasy chips which, quite frankly, our local take-away chip shop makes a better job of.American diner Jen B was also left unsatisfied at Castle Take-Away in Dover, reports Kent Live.We ate here recently as we were told this was the best in Dover. We paid for the Sea Bass at £ but I agree with other reviews that it was good but the portion did seem small for the price. A bit greasy as well but it did taste good. It was not all doom and gloom however, with some America reviewers bucking the trend.

A man wearing a black riding helmet and carrying a whip was seen picking up rescue cat Mini and looking over his shoulder before tossing its body into a garden in Maldon, Cornwall. He arrived as a pack of eight hunting hounds were caught on video savaging the -year-old black tabby cat who belonged to resident Carly Jose, . Furious onlookers shouted after him b*****d and come here as he fled the rural housing estate following the incident in March. One woman can be heard yelling: What the hell have they done  Theyaposve got one of our cats. A male resident said: He threw it over my garden.  The hunter, dressed in a red hoodie, dark jeans and khaki wellies, was seen carrying what appeared to be a horsewhip in his left hand as left the area. Distressed residents called out from their homes as he began running towards a country footpath. Charlie Knight, who filmed the incident, chased the man onto a single-track road warning him that the incident was caught on video.  The man replied: Iaposm coming back in a minute mate. Iaposm just going to sort the hounds out and Iaposll be back. Leader of the hunt John Sampson, who owns a Cornish farm, was last week sentenced for being in charge of dogs that were dangerously out of control and fined £,. Ms Jose spoke of her joy and said it was a huge victory against the hunts. The court heard Sampson was exercising  hunting hounds at the time near the village before six or seven dogs fled into the housing estate where the incident happened. A petition titled Miniaposs law is now calling for the government to protect animals and the public from hunting activities such as trail hunts and hunting hound exercises.Ministers will debate the issue in Parliament after the petition gained more than , signatures. Responding to the petition, a government spokesperson said: The police can take action under the Dogs Act  where dogs are out of control and dangerous to other animals. This Government will not amend the Hunting Act.

Like flipping a coin, it’s a simple strategy that we assume is fair - especially as it doesn’t always go the way we want it to. However, there’s a simple trick that can make sure we win at the game every time - and it’s all about thinking ahead.As seen in a video by Numberphile, you can loosely use mathematics to ensure you’re always going to come up on top.There are two findings from the video featuring Dr. Hannah Fry, and those two findings could bag you a win.Winners always repeat their strategy Losers changeHannah explained: “This is the thing that you can exploit basically. If you lose, and your opponent won by playing rock, the chances are that they’ll play rock again. “You just lost on scissors, so you should play paper. Even though paper beats rock, you should go the other way round the triangle.” Basically,you’ve played scissors and they’ve played rock, you should play the thing that didn’t come up, which in this case, is rock. This is where things get a little sneaky, especiallyyou’ve won, and once you understand the method it’s very easy. Dr. Hannah Fry explains: “If you’ve won, they’re going to expect you to play the same thing again. “So they’re going to play the thing that would beat the thing that you’ve just played, so you need to play the thing that will beat the thing.”  Confused  You shouldn’t be, once you put this sneaky skill into practice, you’re bound to win every time - it’s all about thinking ahead. She continues: “Let’s imagine that you’ve just played rock and won, that means that they’ve played scissors and they’re going to think you’ve played rock again. “Which means that they’re going to play paper, which means that you should play scissors, you basically end up going backwards around the triangle.” This strategy is a combination of psychology and mathematics, and is defined as “rooted in game theory.” Hannah concludes: “It’s the mathematics of looking at decisions and strategies, and your best move is dependent on what the other person is playing, you can frame in game theory.” So next time you’re deciding what takeaway to get, make sure you stick with this tactic and you’re bound to get what you want.

The -year-old, who grew up in foster care, said she went aposoff the railsapos after turning  and began using drugs - mainly cocaine as well as amphetamines and ketamine - which left her aposfinancially ruinedapos. She has now been clean for the last few months and has been offered a council flat in Nantwich after months of bidding via the Cheshire Homechoice social housing service.After being unable to afford utensils and furniture, Caitlinaposs friend Ella Blake put out an appeal for help on a Community Facebook group, askinganyone had any spare items like pots or pans, Cheshire Live reports.But the response was beyond what Ella expected, with people donating a television, kitchen furniture, a wardrobe, bedside drawers and curtains as well as Christmas cards and presents.  The scale of the communityaposs kindness has overwhelmed Caitlin, who initially didnapost even realised Ella had written the post. She said: I was really amazed, I didnapost expect anything like this, I really didnapost. I was just thinking Iaposd be moving into a flat with nothing in it. Iaposm just so, so thankful for what everyone has done. It has given me a bit of hope in people. No-one has ever done this much for me in my entire le. Ella, who works as a carer, said theyaposd been friends for a couple of years and spotted she was moving near where she lived in Nantwich when Caitlin posted the news on Facebook. Ella initially searched Facebook Marketplace before she had the idea of seeking help on the Nantwich Community page. The -year-old said: I donapost think she even knows the extent of how kind people have been. Theyaposve sent her Christmas presents, perfumes, toiletries, a massive TV and kitchen furniture. Sheaposs been on a bit of a journey without a doubt. Hopefully all the trouble and turmoil is coming to end. I think everyone just wanted to give her a bit of a fighting chance. Caitlin has lived a tough le up until this point, growing up in Derbyshire with her mum, dad and three siblings. Her parents struggled with drugs themselves and when Caitlin was seven, social services took the children into care.  My mum and dad were heavy drug users and Iaposve got three other siblings. I donapost think they could cope, especially with being younger parents as well, Caitlin said. We just ended up getting put in care. My mum had no choice. One day we had social workers at the door. We had to pack our stuff and go within an hour. That was it, I didnapost know where we were going. She spent the rest of her childhood in childrenaposs homes, getting aposmoved aroundapos a lot, while she attended school and college. At , she moved into Cotswold House in Winsford - a supported accommodation for homeless people - as she had nowhere  to go. But when she turned  she started struggling with drug abuse and spent a lot of her time living on the streets, including around the Crewe area. When I was  I just went off the rails. I think, because social services werenapost involved anymore, I just felt like I could do what I want, she said. Caitlin eventually ended up at The Limes in Middlewich where she is currently getting help with her drug issues. She is due to sign for her new flat on Monday , said she is looking forward to the next stage of her le. Iaposm just really excited because Iaposve never had my own tenancy before. Obviously Iaposm not going to get as much help as I do here with managing my own tenancy but I think Iaposll get the gist of it, she said. Sheaposs hoping to find employment through the Job Centre as soon as she can and will continue to receive drug rehabilitation treatment. Ella said many of the items given by the community are being stored in her lounge, which she described as currently looking like an aposunderground IKEAapos. She said: Itaposs nice to see that no-one is judging anyone for the circumstances theyaposre in. Instead of putting people down, theyaposre getting behind them and helping out. Nantwich is a wonderful town for the sense of community and the way everyone has really come together for a complete stranger is amazing. It is certainly humbling without a doubt. With everything going on in the world, the fact that the community still works together like this is incredible.

And despite the milder t emperatures today, there are two Met Office warnings in place for the very north of the country until Monday. The first warns of potentially dangerous winds hitting northern parts of Scotland from pm on Sunday until am the next day, with a large area subject to a second warning between midnight and noon tomorrow.

To the south though, across England and Wales skies tend to brighten and there will be some sunny spells developing, with  or  degrees in many places - well above average for the time of year. Where we sees the sky brighten it will be very mild in the south and then it turns very stormy in the far north west later. Itaposs all down to this developing area of low pressure thataposs moving towards the UK, undergoing a rapid deepening process as it engages with the jet stream on Sunday, bringing some very strong winds to the far north west of Scotland.

Looking further ahead and with Christmas on the horizon, we should be braced for a chilly Christmas as forecasters predict frost to grip the country. During the festive week, temperatures in the south of England and Wales will plummet on Christmas Eve while frost and fog will sweep across the country on Christmas Day. MET OFFICE OUTLOOK Today: Patchy rain over Wales and central England spreading northwards with some drier and brighter conditions developing to the northeast of high ground.

Night sweats are when you sweat so much that your night clothes and bedding are soaking wet.At a briefing convened by South Africaaposs Department of Health, GP Unben Pillay listed the symptoms that Omicron patients were reporting, ChronicleLive reports. The GP said that he is also seeing patients with the iant presenting with a dry cough, fever, fatigue, and a lot of body pains. He suggested that vaccinated people tend to do much better.The UKHSA has also said it believes the booster Covid jab is essential in protecting against Omicron, though it is too early for certainty as to how the vaccines work against it.However, there are many encouraging signs that the current vaccines will provide some protection against the new strain of the virus.  Early data suggests booster jabs against Covid- do provide an extra layer of protection against the illness. If the iant does undermine vaccine performance, extra protection against the virus might require four or more jabs, possibly with new vaccine formulations — sharpening questions over whether boosting will need to continue indefinitely, states an article published in the journal Nature. The Omicron iant has also further clouded forecasts of how booster campaigns will affect the pandemic’s trajectory.The new Omicron iant of coronavirus is continuing to spread across the UK with cases recorded in the North East. The World Health Organisationhas declared Omicron a iant of concern and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed new measures this week to curb the spread.Face masks will be compulsory in many indoor venues, working-from-home advice has ed and a NHS Covid pass will be needed to get in to nightclubs and venues.It comes as cases of the Omicron Covid iant have been confirmed in Northumberland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough.According to figures released on Friday evening, there were three cases recorded in Northumberland, two in Newcastle and one in Middlesbrough - all based on positive tests from the week ending November .UK Health Security Agency- which released the data - said it expects there to have been more than one million cases of the new iant in the UK by the end of December, and for Omicron to be the dominant strain of Covid within a fortnight.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonNHSWorld Health OrganisationDepartment of HealthPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The sole earner in the family is Mark, who gets £, every four weeks from his job at a Co-op store. Last month, however, the family did not receive their Universal Credit payment as, according to the Department for Work and Pensionsassessment period, it resulted that Mark was paid twice in a month.Due to the issue, they will get no payment between October  and December , Wales Online reports. Since Cardf Council uses the same system as the DWP to monitor wages, their council tax has also gone up. Lynette, , said: We feel very upset and very anxious. Itaposs not helping our mental health. I dread the post coming. Weaposve really struggled in the last couple of weeks. Weaposve managed to pay the bills but everything  has been a struggle day by day. The DWP and the council said a householdaposs Universal Credit payments and council tax y from month to month depending on earnings. Lynette added: Our first Universal Credit payment was in July. Itaposs around £ a month, but because my husband gets paid every four weeks and Universal Credit is monthly, the DWP claimed he was paid twice last month. One of my husbandaposs wage payments was October  and the next was on November . They were both put together and the implication was that he was actually getting £, a month. I tried contacting the DWP but they said there was nothing they could do. It was such a shock. Weaposre getting kicked in the teeth left, right and centre. The DWP didnapost even tell us [initially]. I had to check the payment on November  and it said we were not getting anything that month. In a panic I rang the DWP to be told we wouldnapost be getting anything for November.  The family usually benefits from a council tax reduction but Cardf Council upped the rate from £ to £ a month after Mark was judged to have had an increase in earnings last month, even though he received the usual four-weekly amount. Lynette said she applied for the council tax benefit to be reinstated next month. The family also said they feel under pressure because Lynetteaposs mum had to go into a nursing home due to dementia and the council said they will have to move house as the tenancy is in her mumaposs name. Lynette was told she cannot take over the tenancy as it was already taken over when her father died and it passed to her mother - and the law states this cannot happen more than once. The woman said: Weaposre not living. Weaposre existing day by day, waiting to know when and where we have to move. My husband works in Fairwater, and this area is all myself and my daughter have ever known, but weaposre told we could be moved anywhere in Cardf. It seems as soon as we get over one hurdle thereaposs another. A DWP spokesperson said: Universal Credit adjusts to a household’s earnings to ensure people receive the right level of support. Mr Davies received more than £, in wages during the couple’s last assessment period and, as a result, their payment was reduced. ButMr Davies earns less over the next month then the couple will see an increase in their next payment. A council spokesperson said: Eligibility for a council tax reduction is assessed on income received each month and the amount of reduction applied to a household’s account can y from month to month depending on earnings received. So, a household expecting their income to decrease one month, can expect the amount of council tax reduction they are eligible for to increase. The council’s money advice team is available to help residents experiencing money problems and can offer advice with budgeting, income maximisation, claiming grants and discounts as well as practical support.

The head of a London hospital said staff are worn out and quite frightenedStaff are traumatised and worn out, hospital chiefs have warned Image: PAByChiara FiorilloNews ReporterRod Minchin:,  Dec | commentsOver-stretched and traumatised nurses are refusing to be redeployed to Covid wards, hospital bosses around the country have warned. After spending months on the frontline of the pandemic, staff have been exposed to trauma and stress, with little psychological support.Now, as the new Omicron strain threatens to put further pressure on the NHS, there are fears that the number of hospitalisations and deaths could rise this winter. Yesterday, scientists from the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicinesaid Omicron could cause between , to , deaths in England over the next five monthsfurther restrictions are not introduced.However, a hospital chief from the Midlands said critical care is already at  per cent bed occupancy. He said the hospital was planning to expand into other areas as a contingency plan, but this will not be possible as staff who worked in previous Covid waves are now refusing to be on the frontline again.  He explained: It was voluntary before and now they’re saying no. We are getting people, from a critical care perspective, downing tools. So we can’t expand further.The head of a London NHS hospital told The Sunday Times : I’ve got a lot of staff who have said they’re not going back on to Covid wards and I think you’ve got to pay attention when people are saying that.People are pretty worn out and quite frightened about being redeployed into Covid wards again. They don’t want to go there again. A study carried out by the University of Bath found that staff felt overwhelmed during the pandemic and do not want to go through the same stress again. According to the study, NHS doctors are angry at being treated as Covid cannon fodder rather than heroes.  It is the first research to capture the views of more than , doctors in the UK and Ireland responding to Covid- since early . It has been authored by researchers from the Universities of Bath and Bristol, UWE Bristol and the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and paints a bleak picture of the multiple challenges doctors are facing. Despite working at permanent maximum capacity, the medics told researchers of their frustrations at those not following public health advice, and towards the Government for failing to support them. One senior doctor said: I feel, at times, that I am considered totally expendable and that,I die or become ill, not only will it have been preventable with political will, I will simply be an inconvenient statistic. Iaposm not a Covid hero, Iaposm Covid cannon fodder. A junior doctor said: Knowing the Government was failing in so many ways to support us... failed Test and Trace, failed PPE procurement, weak messaging, permitted non-compliance with mask-wearing and distancing, set a poor example . We as healthcare providers were alone and utterly unsupported, apart from the weekly round of applause that was a pointless gesture and felt like a kick in the teeth.  Jo Daniels, a clinical psychologist who led the research, said nurses have been through trauma with no respite or support. The researcher said: Some of the stories frontline workers told us about for this research are truly devastating: last moments spent trying to set up an iPad in time for a young mother to say goodbye to her children wrestling to intubate agitated patients family members watching loved ones die remotely via video-link. Added to this is the scale - the sheer number of frontline workers for whom these experiences have just become normalised - these results are truly shocking. We are seeing increasing levels of staff attrition, absenteeism, poor psychological health, and loss of le, yet frontline doctors are expected to just carry on. Despite the popular media narrative of healthcare workers being our Covid- heroes, many simply do not feel that way in terms of how they are being supported. Professor Edd Carlton, from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: What is most worrying is that Covid- has compounded issues that were already commonplace pre-pandemic and now are putting a tangible strain on doctorsapos own physical and mental health. As the NHS attempts to recover, this research shows that there needs to be a renewed focus on properly supporting doctors to protect their health and wellbeing so that they can be there for all of us when we most need them. The study, Itaposs Been Ugly: A Large-Scale Qualitative Study Into The Dficulties Frontline Doctors Faced Across Two Waves Of The Covid- Pandemic, is published in the journal International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.

If they have any of these ailments, they should think about staying home during the festive period. Boris Johnson has not banned Christmas parties this year but people should still be cautious and be aware the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing.Many of the symptoms are similar to cold-like conditions which people should be on the look out for. Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app, said those with cold-like symptoms should work from home and avoid parties at Christmas to curb the spread of coronavirus. He told Times Radio, the UK should be “much more open-minded about who we are testing” and “get more people to isolate at least for a few days with cold-like symptoms”.“At the moment, we’re estimating that somewhere between one and three and one in four colds are actually due to Covid,” he said. “And so that’s quite a high rate of people that are currently not even bothered to get a lateral flow test, or getting a PCR test, going to parties and spreading it around. “Sothat transfers to Omicron then we’re going to be compiling that problem much faster than we would need to.”The Liverpool Echo added: “We want to tell people thatyou don’t feel well that day, don’t go out, don’t go to work, work from home, because the start of that snfle, the start of that sore throat, that headache could be a mild dose of Covid that is just breaking through your vaccine.“So I think everyone needs to be much more aware of a whole range of symptoms and not wait for the loss of smell or taste which may never come, not wait for fever, not wait for that persistent cough.” Many of the ailments are fairly unrecognisable and are similar to a common cold. The symptoms to be aware of include: . A high temperature. This means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back. A new, continuous cough. This means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours. A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. This means youaposve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normal.  . Night sweats when you sweat so much that your night clothes and bedding are soaking wet, even though where you are sleeping is cool. . A blocked or runny nose . A sore throat. Headaches . Muscle aches . Sneezing . Pressure in your ears and face The ten symptoms do not mean you have the virus and could simply be a cold. But people area advised to pick up a lateral flow test or go for a PCR testthey are in any doubt they have the virus, particularly since the Omicron strain which is more infectious.

Mr Wise called the restaurant in advance to ensure tips weren’t shared among all staff in order to make a real dference to just one or two people. The group picked Ryan - who was tearful when presented with the generous gt - to split with another waitress who served their table. But shortly after Ryan said the restaurant managers demanded the tip was shared among all of the restaurant staff - something that hadn’t been requested in the three and a half years she worked there. Do you think the waitress deserved to be fired  Have your say in the comments section  She told Fox : “I was told that I was going to be giving my cash over to my sht manager and I would be taking home  percent.” Ryan - who had studied Spanish at the University of Arkansas - had planned to pay off her student loan with the money. But the bosses’ orders would have cut her gt to approximately £,. During the evening, Mr Wise, who picked the restaurant because its his we’s favourite, recorded the big reveal. “I’m so sorry to interrupt everyoneaposs dinner, this will only take  seconds, he begins in the video.  “We have a table full of absolutely amazing people from all over the country who have traveled here, and tonight weaposre hosting a £ Dinner Club,” he tells Ryan, as he wraps his arm around her. “Everyone at this table has contributed or tipped £ for you and for the other waitress who unfortunately had to go home because sheaposs not feeling well. “And then we put it out to our social media channels, and then we actually had a bit more money sent in, so we are tipping a total of £, for you to split with the other girl who took care of us.apos  He adds that waiting staff suffered during Covid and it was a gesture that a friend of his came up with to help give back, he told  News. Sadly, a few days later Mr Wise discovered Ryan was been fired for ‘violating’ the restaurant’s rules by telling him about the company’s tip policy. Mr Wise said after he discovered Ryan had been forced to share the tip he ed to the restaurant to get his money back and to hand it over directly to Ryan. However the owner refused to communicate.Upon hearing Ryan was fired, Mr Wise took to social media in a bid to help her further. He wrote on Facebook : “I’m so saddened to hear that the girl we tipped the other night at our £ Dinner Club has been fired from her job. “I donapost fully understand why this would happen to what seems like such a sweet and kind-hearted woman. “Nonetheless, Iaposm committed to showing her that there are great people in the world that will do good when they can.”He then set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds for her, where he describes Ryan as a ‘very kind woman’ who was working two jobs during the pandemic to make ends meet. He wrote on the page: “She has incredible aspirations to grow her own business and I can tell has a servants-heart.“Le can be really tough but I hope we can all band together to make sure this wonderful woman knows there are still really good people out there that will help when they can.” So far the page has raised £,. Oven and Tap officials told Fox  they honoured the group’s request to give the cash to just two staff members. They said: “After dining, this large group of guests requested that their gratuity be given to two particular servers. We fully honoured their request. “Out of respect for our highly valued team members, we do not discuss the details surrounding the termination of an employee.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Employment rights\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Wildine Aumoithe, from Miami, Florida, was recently given the Guinness World Record title of the shortest non-mobile woman in the world. The -year-old has the rarest form of dwarfism, known as, SADDAN dysplasia, and her parents were told that she wouldnapost survive  hours after she was born. However, Wildine defied the odds and celebrated her th birthday earlier this year and was recently given the title of the worldaposs shortest woman. She said: It feels amazing to have a Guinness World Record title, I am really proud of it. I am also the first Haitian-American to hold the shortest woman record which makes it even cooler. Despite my condition, I have as much of a normal le as I could. I have never let it hold me back and miss out from doing things in le. My friends have always treated me as though I am the same as them and I have never faced any bullying due to being a little person which I am so grateful for. When my mum, Wilda, was six months pregnant with me the doctors told my parents that I was going to be born with dwarfism. My mum told me that she cried when she heard the diagnosis because she was scared as she didnapost know what dwarfism was and I was her first child. After I was born, at first the doctors thought I had achondroplasia, but after further tests, I was diagnosed with SADDAN dysplasia because of how short I was. SADDAN dysplasia is the rarest form of dwarfism and I wasnapost expected to live past  hours.  After I made it past that, I was even sent to a hospice for the first six months of my le because I wasnapost expected to live. Eventually, Wildine was able to go home with her parents and her mum has been her primary carer ever since. Wildine was able to walk when she was younger, however, she now uses a wheelchair as she has bowed legs and therefore is unable to walk. She said: I can sit on the floor and move around but I canapost walk anymore as since I am getting older, so are my bones. My mum has to help me with all my daily needs. She doesnapost work so that she can be with me all the time to help. This world was not made for short people, this world was built for people who are ft tall and above.  It can be hard sometimes because make a lot of modicationsI want to go and even in my house. Everywhere I go I have to figure out how itaposs going to work for me. In our house, my bed is modied for me, and so are my drawers and a desk for me to work at. I have four wheelchairs that help me get around, but I need help from my mum with my daily needs and to reach things. Wildine has attended school her entire le and is extremely outgoing. She says that she is a social butterfly and makes friends very easily. Wildine added: I am a very confident person and I have a big personality.

She asked how her hair was, and he answered honestly - to him, it was gross, last it smelled, was greasy, and needed washing much more often. The woman was furious at her partneraposs description of her hair, before going on to say that he was just jealous because he was bald. What do you think about the manaposs honesty  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the man said: My girlfriend has really long curly hair. Itaposs very pretty but she only washes it once a week. She still showers every day but only washes her hair on Sundays. I think this is very gross. It doesnapost start to look greasy until the last two days and by this time she puts it up when weaposre out in public so you canapost tell, but she wears it down when weaposre home and I donapost like the look of it. Iaposve always had a problem with germs and the look of her oily scalp makes me uncomfortable.

The other day I told her I didnapost like that she doesnapost wash her hair more and that it looks gross. She got offended and told me I didnapost deserve an opinion on her hair because I donapost have any. Soon after sharing his story online, the man was inundated with comments from other Reddit users who said he was in the wrong for complaining. One wrote: Curly hair requires a dferent kind of care than straight hair and washing it too often can damage it. She has obviously worked out a routine that works for her and her curls. You get no say in the matter. Your insecurities about germs are a you problem, not hers. And an oily scalp has nothing to do with germs. Don’t lose your hair over something like this. While another said: It is actually very reasonable to wash your hair infrequently. I have long curly hair, itaposs grown much healthier and fallen out a lot less washing it maybe twice a week. Those oils are good for your hair and scalp. Especiallyshe has curly hair, overwashing can make your hair dull and frizzy.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

The -year-old always had an image in her head of how she wanted to look, and sheaposs spent years achieving her dream appearance.But the dancer, who earns a fortune on OnlyFans each month, hasnapost had the best reaction to her new look, which has resulted in people calling her a demon and caused one person to run away and hide.One pal even told her they thought she looked prettier before. Kierstyn has spent £, on extreme body modications including facial tattoos, fangs, piercings and breast implants She said: “I always knew I wanted to look like this, I have had this vision in my head since I was young and have finally fulfilled it,” Kiersyn, who has over , followers on TikTok . “The way I looked before compared to now, I feel so much happier. “Before I had no self love or even understood who I was, now I feel I understand myself the most and have the most self love and confidence. “When some people see my eyes they stare and point and say nothing, others give me ugly looks, and some will straight up get in my face and say they hate it. “The craziest reactions are from people online hiding behind a screen. “They love to say, ‘you look like a demon’ or ‘you were so much prettier before,’ or ‘you must not have had a good childhood’. “But I also get people who are so sweet and say they love it and want pictures with me. And earlier this year she decided to have her most drastic bit of work done - tattooing her eyeballs. Kiestyen, from Houston, Texas, first became interested in body modications aged  and eventually got inked a year later in . In addition to tattoos, she has also spent around , on fang and breast implants, as well as piercings in her nipple, tongue, both nostrils and bridge of her nose. She said: “My family and friends weren’t surprised about my modications because it’s something I’ve always wanted but they were shocked when I tattooed my eyeballs. “I did it as a way of showing my dference and to see how shocked and offended people can get when they don’t understand something that’s not the norm of society.” Since her first inking aged , Kierstyn has had many more including a complete arm sleeve consisting of ious tributes to her family.  She also has a dream catcher, a geisha girl, scorpion and a complete arm sleeve in black, which she says helped her through periods of suffering body dysmorphia. She said: “In  I got a moth on my throat, a rose dagger on my shoulder and Hebrew writing on my neck. “This year I’ve had a butterfly on my forehead, a dagger with roses on my face, a bat underneath my breasts and my eyes tattooed. “My latest tattoo is on my stomach of butterflies and strawberries to complement the bat. “My favourite tattoo would probably be the butterfly on my head because it was such a bold move. “I’ve never wanted to fit in, Iaposve always been the odd one out.” Kierstyn has no plant to stop anytime soon and is looking to get the other side of her face inked in January . She added: “I’m not sure what I’m going to get yet and the goal is to be fully tattooed head-to-toe before next Christmas so we’ll see hopefully I can do it. “The only advice I can really give to anyone wanting to mody or tattoo themselves is: do it out of love, do it out of the fact that it will make you happy. “We should only do things that bring us joy, for me that’s what modying myself does, so I want that for othersthat’s what they chose, nothing but love and happiness.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cosmetic surgeryPlastic surgeryPeriodsTattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Kicking Donkey is an aposelegant yet relaxedapos country pub that stocks a wide range of real ales, and has a full menu that of course has a Sunday roast, as Lancs Live reports.Many reviews of the pub in Ormskirk, Lancashire, praise the food - saying the homemade gravy is delicious and that the meat is cooked to perfection, but one diner wasnapost as impressed. They left a review online saying they were apostotally disgustedapos that Yorkshire puddings werenapost included with the roast, and were only available as an extra - costing £.. What do you think of the price  Let us know in the comments...In a one-star review on Tripadvisor, a guest named Steve wrote: Went there for a Sunday roast. In all my le I have never been in a restaurant for a roast beef dinner and told it does not include a Yorkshire pudding. It costs an extra £. andyou want gravy with that, it also costs an extra £.. Totally disgusted. We will never be going back there. First visit. Never again. Steve was not alone in his criticism of the restaurant, as another diner named Larry said the food was bland, plus he also took exception to having to pay for Yorkshire puddings.  He wrote: Roast dinner was bland, hardly any taste. You want a Yorkshire pudding or more gravy, fine, but you need to pay extra. Dogs allowed in eating areas, not great idea - so not for me. Tried it, but no more. But now the restaurant owner, commenting online as Matt F, has hit back at the critics on Tripadvisor. To Larry, he wrote: Hi. Thanks for the feedback, very sorry to hear that your experience with us wasnapost all it could be.  We would have been more than happy to swap your meal for something  or knock something off your billweaposd been aware that it wasnapost to your satisfaction.

For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. And to Steve, he said: Hi Steve. Sorry to have upset you so much. The reason we charge for Yorkies and extra gravy is that theyaposre both home-made from scratch. This takes time and effort, we donapost have the manpower to make a yorkie for every meal, so we make a batch and when theyaposre gone, theyaposre gone. We charge for extra gravy because we put plenty on anyway. In the past, people have asked for extra and then it comes back untouched. I believe that the staffaposs work should be reflected in their pay, and so we do need to charge for things like this. They cost us money to make. Itaposs a disappointment to hear that you wonapost dine with us again, but I felt at the very least you were owed an explanation.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Rivets are normally found around the front and back pockets on jeans and theyaposre made by pressing or hammering a ‘washer’ or ‘disk’ onto a metal stud through the denim. The use of rivets on pockets dates back to  and their existence is all thanks to a tailor from Nevada named Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss  Co.Davis had been buying fabric from Levi Strauss to create clothing for miners and adding rivets to the pockets.He wrote a letter to Strauss explaining how the copper rivets helped to strengthen pockets when the miners were filling them with heavy tools.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Strauss and Davis went on to form a partnership and received a patent for an improvement in fastening pocket openings. Rivets continue to feature on jeans all these years later, appearing in places where the most strain is put on the fabric to prevent seams from splitting. As well as this, there are a number of other common items in your home which have curious uses and features.Take for instance, a Heinz bottle of tomato ketchup.If you look closely at a glass bottle of the red sauce, youaposll notice the number  above the label, just below the neck.  While this number is often thought to represent the ious dferent products Heinz makes, it turns out, itaposs also strategically placed for an important reason. According to the company, the spot is the perfect place to tap on the bottle when youaposre struggling to get ketchup out. In the trivia section of their website, they explained: To release Heinz Tomato Ketchup from its glass bottle with extra speed, apply a firm tap to the spot marked aposapos on the neck label. And have you ever wondered why the letters on your laptop or computer keyboard arenapost in alphabetical order  Some of the first keyboards invented for typewriters had the keys positioned in alphabetical order, but it soon became apparent that the arrangement didnapost work very well as the typebars would clash.  So the whole thing had to be re-arranged in order to make the machines work, taking into consideration the most common letter combinations and the frequency of use for each letter. The result was the QWERTY keyboard we use today, which was designed by Christopher Sholes. Going back a few years now to your school days, do you remember those double-coloured erasersyou had in your pencil case, where one end was red and the other was blue  That wasnapost just a fun design - each colour actually has a dferent use. Many believe the red is for erasing pencil marks and the blue side rubs out pen, but this wasnapost always the case. The red end is softer as itaposs actually meant for use on light paper, while the blue end is intended for coarser paper.  We also recently discovered that the sombrero on Sierra Tequila bottles has a aposgame-changingapos use.While some assumed it was merely a fun addition to the bottle, it turns out the sombrero can be used as a lime squeezer and the ideal item to measure out the right amount of tequila for a shot. But most interesting of all its purposes, is that the rim of the sombrero can also be used neatly salt your glass.People on Twitter lost their minds over the discovery after it was shared by Jack Mull.Iaposm shook, replied one person. Another said: You have changed everything. A third commented: WHATTTTT NO THIS CHANGES THE ENTIRE GAME.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Eventhe tenants are good at chipping in with the chores or have introduced the dreaded cleaning rota, the general standard of budget rented accommodation is normally below par. So one house decided to take matters into their own hands and give the supplied rug on their living room floor a good scrub, claiming it had never been cleaned. They filled the bath tub with water and cleaning products and left the rug to soak overnight - and were staggered by the results.Sharing the process on TikTok, user @ annachiowo posted a number of videos online documenting the step-by-step. She wrote: Cleaning our uni house rug thataposs clearly never been washed. Sheaposs a cool rug, but so old and dusty. The students add a number of cleaning products to the hot water before adding the brown patterned rug. After just a few minutes the water starts to turn brown as years of dirt start to come free. Half an hour later the water is completely black and a layer of grime appears around the back tub. After an hour, they drain the water and start to rinse the rug. They can then be seen wiping the water away and the colour beneath is several shares lighter. As they rinse the rug using the shower hose even more brown water can be seen escaping. They then take the unusual step of getting into the bath to stand on the rug, possibly to squeeze out any excess water and grime. One jokes: Rug got me acting up. Itaposs then time for another soak, and this time they leave it overnight. When theythe next morning the water has turned a disgusting brown colour. So we left her in overnight. So much gunk left on the side as it was draining. They then wash the tassels on the side using shampoo and conditioner, which even they admit probably wasnapost needed. Was this necessary  Probably not, but very satisfying. They then take the rug outside to dry in the garden, but received several messages from people saying it would never dry.  However a short sit on the radiator and the rug was good as new - and the pattern was even clearer than ever. It shows a beautul green dragon surrounded by flowers and leaves.

What do you think about the kind act  Let us know in the comments...Mari said: When I thought Iaposd lost it, you panic, donapost you  You just think, aposWhat are you going to do without it apos Itaposs not a very high-tech phone, but itaposs a decent one. To me, itaposs worth everything, because I rely on it so much. Mari had spent the day in Manchester with her husband, son and her sonaposs fiancé, buying Christmas gts - but the day was almost ruined when Mari realised sheaposd lost her phone, along with the hundreds of pictures stored on it. She continued: Those pictures are not just valuable to me but to their families as well, because we put them up on the Facebook page.As Mari approached her car, she spotted a note on the windscreen - and at first she thought her day was about to go from bad to worse.

The fact their data shows a reduction in speeds across the Borders is really encouraging news.\"A public consultation was also conducted, and feedback on the mph speed limits was also sought from local community councils.Using the data and feedback from the public, the report recommends that the mph limit be the \"default\" around towns and villages, with some areas retaining \"mph or mph buffer zones in place where suitable\".The buffer zones will be away from residential areas and on stretches of road \"where it is felt driving at mph is dficult to justy and particularly challenging\".Mr Edgar added: ldquoI would like to thank everyone that contributed to the public consultation, providing really valuable local insight and opinions.

near his home.In a letter sent to Innerleithen Community Council chairman Marshall Douglas, John Paterson, of The Ley, said that during the weekends and summer months the layby adjacent to his driveway and the green spaces along the B are ldquorammed with vehicles which have flocked to the region.At a meeting of the community council on Monday , Mr Paterson shared his concerns and requested that action be taken to tackle the issue, described by one councillor as ldquohellish.ldquoWersquove always had issues with camping, wersquove even had some trees chopped down by people camping there, litter, people urinating and defecating either on my property or at my entrance which is pretty unpleasant as you can imagine,\" he said. ldquoAnd it just seems to have reached a real pitch in recent times.ldquoI know itrsquos been very bad for some while now at the likes of the Cauld and the golf club used to have a lot of problems with people parking there as well.Mr Paterson has spoken with Police Scotland about the issue and it was suggested to put up bollards or reflector posts around the bend to discourage people from parking on the verges.Tweeddale East councillor Robin Tatlersaid he would look into solutions.He said: ldquoI absolutely sympathise with you. I can understand that this must be absolutely hellish.ldquoIn the short term we need to do something immediately about trying to discourage people from parking in inappropriate places and Irsquom more than happy to take that forward to the community action teamwith the police.ldquoI think in the medium term we need to be trying to encourage people, when there are peak times, to not park there but to park down in the town.Also at this weekrsquos meeting was Emma Guy from Enduro World Series , who formerly worked as project coordinator for the Tweed Valley Tourism Bid..removeShe said: ldquoIrsquom well aware of this issue and some of us [from Tweed Valley Tourism Bid] did try and tackle it on the ground about a year and a half ago with putting signs up near the Cauld.ldquoSo around the event at the beginning of October we had shuttles so people wouldnrsquot park in these hotspots, we cordoned off areas, we spoke to the golf club and we had marshals in place to police any bad behaviour, so tat worked quite well.ldquoOur kind of feeling is that this is an ongoing problem and it does need solutions, there needs to be some kind of visitor infrastructure investment and certainly in my role with the Tourism Bid we were pushing really hard for that.ldquoFrom an EWS point of view, with regard to events, we worked quite hard to manage that problem because we know how disruptive and how unpleasant that can be.ldquoIn my role with EWS we would support and put our weight behind any proposals to the council to SOSEto try and alleviate this.Tweeddale East councillor Shona Haslam, of the Conservatives, added: ldquoIn terms of the long term [solution] obviously wersquove got pound million coming into mountain biking infrastructure into Innerleithen and pound million for a town the size of Innerleithen is pretty signicant.ldquoSo, wersquove got the Mountain Biking Innovation Centre that is moving forward in the background, obviously therersquos a lot of commercial stuff in there that wersquore not allowed to talk about, and there is the bike park as well.

She was delighted to have won, even though she only took music for enjoyment and went on to express her disappointment at not being able to perform fully last year. She graciously stated that she was glad pupils are ldquoable to get back to that now and other people are enjoying it. While Amy is not pursuing music further , she explained that ldquoitrsquos not something I want to stop doinghellip It was probably one of my favourite subjects, probably the one I was most relaxed aboutthat makes sense. It was always a nice environment to be in and I think that helped me enjoy it a lot more. Amy then admitted at the risk of sounding ldquoclicheacute, that the music department concerts were the highlight of her years at the school.

The classrsquo first question regarded the important issue of who her favourite teacher was. She replied: ldquoI donrsquot really do favourites, butI had to choose it would be Lesley Johnson. Chemistry used to be one of my weaker subjects , however I learned to love it and always looked forward to her classes.

I also love the idea of travel and going on adventures to make some memories.The class asked Abbie to reflect on and offer advice to her first year self, and she responded with ldquothe list is longhellip the main thing Irsquod say is not to be so hard on myself and to accept that set backs are important for learning just as much as success. Carrying on the theme of advice Abbie was asked what she would say to this yearrsquos head team and she told them to ldquoembrace everything because the year will be over before you know it. Therefore, just make the most of every opportunity and most of all enjoy yourself and have fun working with your peers.ByRosie DykesEuan Macrae: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectEuan Macrae was awarded the prestigious Geoffrey Simpson Award for his efforts as head boy. Euan had to show certain skills such as leadership and teamwork in order to effectively guide the school. In an interview with Euan, who is now studying Medicine at University, he highlighted how the school fire and COVID had affected his work ethic during his final few years in school, and how this has impacted the lives of not only himself but also his year group going into exams and beyond. He explained that ldquowersquod never sat proper higher exams which would have set us up for the bigger exams that we were going to have to sit further down the line so the damage from that is probably still lasting. The class asked Euan who his hero was, he very honestly answered with his grandfather, saying that he had always looked up to him due to his intelligence and bravery. When asked who his favourite teacher was at school, Euan passionately discussed how Miss Dunlop, who taught history, influenced his high school experience as ldquoshe had the entire class focused on what she was saying and she never even had to raise her voice. I soon realised that learning could be actually so much fun as well as informative.ByLouise RussellRachel McManus: Tweed Reads PrizeCampbell Hunter was a much-loved member of the Peebles community. He made fantastic contributions to the Tweed Reads organisation and thrived under the leadership role. He was kind, compassionate and showed a real love of encouraging the younger generations to explore and enjoy reading. Campbell worked tirelessly alongside the other members of Tweed Reads and valued the importance of learning, community and service. Campbell was such an important part of the community, and his astounding contribution to Tweed Reads only proved how far he was set to go outside of school.The Tweed Reads prize is named after Campbell Hunter, not just to honour his memory but to honour everything he stood for and his contributions to the Tweed Reads club. The prize is awarded to the few who epitomise Campbellrsquos wonderful leadership qualities and share his values of learning and community. The Campbell Hunter prize for  goes to Rachel McManus who consistently worked creatively within the confines of COVID regulations and was always relentlessly positive.When the class asked Rachel about the prize itself and how she felt to have won it, she described Campbell as ldquoa huge part of Tweed Reads in his last few years of high school and had a real passion for helping young children in the community develop their reading skills and form a love for reading. Rachel says she feels ldquohonoured to have won the Campbell Hunter prize through Tweed Reads and she hopes to continue her involvement with the organisation in coming years.When asked in an interview how the fire and pandemic affected her work ethic within school she replied it had ldquoa massive impact on students. She then went on to congratulate the school saying it has ldquoworked hard to ensure that pupils were still able to have a good amount of teaching with being online and there was always support available should anyone have needed it. Rachel closed her answer by admitting that ldquoit was hard to concentrate on work at home, so you really had to push yourself to stay motivated and keep on top of the workload.Rachel was asked how she felt the award carried on Campbellrsquos legacy. She responded saying that it demonstrates all of the commitment he put into Tweed Reads and his caring nature over his home community.She added: ldquoIn my sixth year of high school I heard many stories of Campbell from Tweed Reads leaders who had worked alongside him.

Tuesday: ldquoThis proposal has infrastructure holes like Swiss cheese, questions that need resolving and time constraints when we need time to review.The committee was asked to approve Taylor Wimpey

would be far higher and the council was likelyto face some shortfall, they insisted the contribution had been calculated using an index to cover inflation.Councillor Lachlan Bruce asked: ldquoIs it usual to use decade-old figures for determining contributions for infrastructure for a development to go ahead He was told it was not normally the case but recalculating the cost of such a complex project could take years.Mrs Bell said that the community council had concerns which had grown in recent years as housing in parts of the estate had been built and families moved in.She said concerns

continuation of a decision on the planning application until more answers could be sought.Councillor Findlay moved a motion for a delay to the decision, citing a need to update the contributions being requested for the East Coast Main Line crossing but was defeated by eight votes to three.The committee then approved the plans by  votes to one with only Councillor Findlay against.A further

He started juggling with knives and balancing on one leg while standing on a giant ball!He was playing with our senses, he knew exactly how to build suspense and stretch our belief in what we thought was possible. You could hear the silenced hush of awe in the audience watching his performance.Awe is something we all need on a regular basis. In fact,you look at the science, it has a huge impact on our ability to think, investigate, make discoveries and inventions.It stimulates our curiosity and makes us feel more connected, for example to nature, to our community, to history or whatever small wonders we experience every day.John Muir often talked about being awestricken by the natural wonders he experienced. They often overwhelmed his senses and this fed his passion to protect the landscape he revered, resulting in the formation of the national parks in the USA.But his sense of awe enthralled him as a child, as he explored the shore and fields around his home town of Dunbar.Thatrsquos the thing our sense of awe is not confined to grand sights. There are everyday wonders we encounter, and pausing for a moment to feel that sense of being ldquoawe-stricken has such a huge impact on our well-being.Scientists will tell you awe will transform your mind, make you feel humble and more empathetic. Itrsquos an uplting spiritual experience, and I donrsquot mean religious, although awe is an important part of all religions.But you donrsquot have to be religious to be spiritual. And I think being able to feel amazed by the things around us is a spiritual way of being.And at Christmas-time especially, I often feel the ironic contradiction of a celebration that has at its heart a powerful spiritual message, but which has been hijacked to promote the needs of mass consumerism.The pressure to buy at this time can hit hard, especially when paying the bills and putting food on the table is a daily concern for so many. Povertyrsquos cold fingers are creeping into our homes as we try to keep warm. Yet, especiallywe have children, we want our family to feel included and blessed at this time. Who doesnrsquot How hard it is to resist the powerful messages thrown at us that fulfilment and happiness can be bought with the latest updated stuff you buy in shops that the phone you got last year is old now, you need a new one those shoes have the wrong label, you just have to have this because everyone  does. The list could be endless.Unfortunately, you canrsquot buy a sense of awe in the shops. No, wait, actually itrsquos fortunate!

The consumerist message is so powerful and universal that itrsquos dficult to opt out.But this is where cultivating our sense of awe can be so uplting, at a time when we feel so much pressure. What really makes us happy is relationships, not stuff. A thoughtful gt is part of that of course, but the awe is in the thought put into it.I think feeling a sense of awe is closely linked to being able to truly appreciate what we have and can experience.That includes the gts of kindness and generosity of people, as much as the blazing sunset or frost covered spiderrsquos web we saw a few days ago.

In fact, should \"those in authority\" wish to find out who we voted for they can do so. I have no recollection of you ever bringing this to peoplersquos attention. It is perhaps being selective in reporting potential breaches of confidentiality.We are all aware of recent cases where children have been abused and murdered by family members.

Recycling parts of John Swinneys failed Named Persons Act in another guise just displays this trait.It is even more on show in the endless cycle of new dates for Indyref, which is also a rejected idea.The SNP does not have the breadth of talent to innovate new policies that are genuinely in the interests of the vast majority of Scots. Taking the Greens on board has narrowed options rather than expand them. The headlong rush to carbon neutrality sooner than is practicable will also bear this out.Under the SNP Scotland is demonstrably going backwards.

Their world seemingly is defined by parochialism and so any enterprising Scot looking towards the massive market south of the jurisdictional Border, must be vilied.Boris Johnson doesnt float my boat either but Ms Maddox is out there promoting a Scottish brand and business, and helping drive her local economy. She is to be applauded, not abused.Martin Redfern, Melrose.A SHAMEFUL WASTE OF TALENTIAIN Macwhirter laments the lack of a coherent industrial policy in Scotland and, as a consequence, the catastrophe about to descend on the prospects of the , iniduals employed in the oil and gas sector .

That seems unlikely to continue. The deterioration in the quality of education, as measured by unbiased international assessment, means that youngsters in this country are being denied the opportunity to achieve their full potential, whether here or where.This represents a shameful waste of talent among Scotlandrsquos youth and is a shocking indictment of  years of SNP Government maladministration.Bob Scott, Drymen.QUESTIONS OVER ASYLUM SEEKERSJOHN Milnechastises me, but I make no excuses for using the words \"pretend asylum seekers\".If they were genuine they would not pay more than pound, and get into rubber dinghies to cross the Channel.

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-. Earlier this afternoon, Ms Sturgeon warned that “dficult decisions” might have to be made in “days to come” amid this “surge”. Aware of the potential economic and social impact that further pandemic restrictions might have, she said that a lot would depend onfinancial aid could be agreed with the UK treasury.In the wake of this announcement and in the anticipation of further developments in the coming days, both Orkney Islands Counciland NHS Orkney have said they are prepared to respond to any new or righter restrictions which may be announced.Asked to respond to the First Minister#s announcement, an OIC spokeswoman said:  #The council is continually assessing its response to the pandemic and holds fortnightly incident management team meetings.#It was highlighted in this morning#s meeting that more announcements were likely to be coming from the First Minister.#Now that these announcements have been made this afternoon, they will be considered by officers, including our Safety  Resilience team and where necessary urgent matters will be escalated to the Incident Management Team or Senior Management Team as required, to ensure that that the council continues to support the response to the pandemic quickly and effectively.#The situation is of course fast moving and members of the public should expect further updates in due course —  but meantime we urge all to take very regular lateral flow device tests and to follow the guidance in respect to hand hygiene, face coverings and social distancing.#In a joint statement, NHS Orkney#s chief executive Michael Dickson and director of public health Louise Wilson explained that the guidance around parties has already been in force within their staff since November.They said: #The rapidly changing national picture is to be expected as we begin to understand the Omicron iant.#The guidance issued last night by Public Health Scotland regarding deferring Christmas parties was already in place here at NHS Orkney, we asked all our staff to show caution around Christmas events and to consider alternatives to reduce risk in early November.#Additionally, we have reminded all staff to work from home wherever possible and of course we are all continuing with our regular lateral flow tests and have all mitigations in place.#As the First Minister stated “our best form of defence is vaccinations”, we’d encourage anyone who is yet to be vaccinated to get in touch with ourselves, you can do this by calling   . We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

He said the emergence of the Omicron iant had strengthened the case for introducing the system.In a letter sent to all Assembly Members, seen by the PA news agency, Mr Swann called for a ldquorespectful debate on the measures and said opponents should set out their preferred alternatives.ldquoWhile I am confident this measure will be supported by a majority of MLAs, I wanted to underline some key points, not least for those who have still to make up their minds, he wrote.ldquoFirstly, it needs to be recognised that Covid certication is a public health measure. By introducing it, the Executive and the Assembly will be following public health advice.ldquoThe Chief Medical Officerand Chief Scientic Adviserhave both recommended the initiative to help reduce the risk of infection in higher risk settings.Mr Swann added that he believed the rationale for certication was ldquowell captured in the Executiversquos Autumn Winter Covid- contingency plan issued by DUP First Minister Paul Givan and Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill in October.ldquoIn spite of the dferences of opinion in the Assembly on this measure, I would appeal for a respectful debate on Monday, he said.ldquoThe situation we are now facing with Covid demands that of us all.ldquoCertication is certainly not a panacea and will need to be complemented by widespread adherence to public health advice. It does, however, offer another layer of protection to our citizens.ldquoI would encourage opponents of the scheme to spell out their preferred alternatives. vw,vw,px, px\"DUP First Minister Paul Givan is opposed to the Covid certication scheme The letter continued: ldquoSimply shouting lsquonorsquo whilst failing to come forward with any genuine alternatives is not a credible position and itrsquos not a luxury that I as Minister of Health, or any of us as MLAs, can afford in the midst of public health emergency.ldquoThere have been no easy answers or simple policy choices in this pandemic. That has been the case for governments across the world.ldquoIt does not serve the public interest to be ducking decisions or constantly criticising from the sidelines.ldquoI commend certication to you as a proportionate policy, that has been introduced in other jurisdictions, and can help keep people safer, business open and support our health service this winter.ldquoThe emerging Omicron threat demonstrates the continued risk from the virus and further strengthens the case for certication.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639060616576.jpg--covid_19___thu_9th_december_figures.jpg?1639060617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211209newscovid 19 thu 9th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

We will be asking when we can get supplies of this vaccine in Northern Ireland.“If I lived in Hungary or Serbia, I wouldn’t be having this discussion — because those vaccines are readily available there.”First Minister Paul Givan will tomorrow line up with his DUP colleagues in Stormont to oppose a policy that less than two months ago he himself publicly listed as a Covid- related contingency option for winter.The plan, which is signed by the First and Deputy First Minister, lays out options for measures the Executive agreed it could take “to slow the spread of the virus” should the pandemic deteriorate.It included the potential to deploy Covid status certication “in higher risk settings” — yet in the Assembly tomorrow Givan and the DUP will reject the Executive-backed proposal, describing it as a “step too far”.The autumn winter plan states thatcase numbers rise sharply orhospital pressures become unsustainable, it would legislate for certication “ considered appropriate and necessary”.But since its publication the new iant Omicron has emerged — with three cases discovered last week — and hospital occupancy as of Friday was at pc.Among the most vocal politician on vaccine passports is DUP MLA Paul Frew.He believes vaccine passports “will cause deep resentment in the community, increase distrust and hesitancy”.While he has insisted that he is “not anti-vax”, Mr Frew has posted messages on social media saying that he was “totally opposed to government coercion and discrimination”.It follows more than a year of mixed messaging from Stormont’s largest party, with many accusing the party’s MLAs and MPs of confusing the public and undermining the response to the virus.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the attitude of some DUP members throughout the pandemic “has been a disgrace”, adding that “they have actively undermined the public health message at every opportunity”.Most ReadCountry music singers Aidan Taaffe and ‘Cowboy’ Larry Taaffe, along with third brother Michael Taaffe, all accused of raping same womanFormer journalist Martina Purdy given second chance to become a nunDUP MLA Jim Wells leading delegation of clergy to call for an alternative Covid- vaccinationAward-winning dog groomer who battered wedding guest branded ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ character by judgeJamie Dornan: People think Northern Ireland is like the Gaza StripTop VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayPolice chiefs refused to pay overtime to officers assigned to Noah Donohoe search operationPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasLatest Northern IrelandNHS appointments to be postponed as part of Covid- booster expansionEmmerdale’s Danny crowned first king of I’m A Celeb castleBelfast Alliance councillor joins UUP: ‘My pro-Union views had left me feeling isolated,’ says Carole HowardMan arrested over  murder of Sinn Fein councillorSwann urges MLAs to back Covid certication systemLatestWhat the papers say – December Johnson should face MPs over participation in No  staff quiz – LabourAustralia’s Josh Hazlewood ruled out of the second Ashes Test in AdelaideWho is I’m A Celebrity champion Danny Miller NHS appointments to be postponed as part of Covid- booster expansion,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said the emergence of the Omicron iant had strengthened the case for introducing the system.In a letter sent to all Assembly Members, seen by the PA news agency, Mr Swann called for a “respectful debate” on the measures and said opponents should set out their preferred alternatives.“While I am confident this measure will be supported by a majority of MLAs, I wanted to underline some key points, not least for those who have still to make up their minds,” he wrote.“Firstly, it needs to be recognised that Covid certication is a public health measure. By introducing it, the Executive and the Assembly will be following public health advice.“The Chief Medical Officerand Chief Scientic Adviserhave both recommended the initiative to help reduce the risk of infection in higher risk settings.”Mr Swann added that he believed the rationale for certication was “well captured” in the Executive’s Autumn Winter Covid- contingency plan issued by DUP First Minister Paul Givan and Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill in October.“In spite of the dferences of opinion in the Assembly on this measure, I would appeal for a respectful debate on Monday,” he said.“The situation we are now facing with Covid demands that of us all.“Certication is certainly not a panacea and will need to be complemented by widespread adherence to public health advice.

Today we are launching the Omicron emergency booster national mission, unlike anything we’ve done before in the vaccination programme, to get boosted now.“A fortnight ago I said we would offer every eligible adult a booster by the end of January.“Today in light of this Omicron emergency I’m bringing that target forward by a whole month.“Everyone eligible aged  and over in England will have the chance to get their booster before the new year.”The Prime Minister – whose address was pre-recorded, meaning he spoke to the nation without being flanked by his scientic advisers and without taking questions – said the UK Government would support the devolved administrations to “accelerate” their own rollouts of third jabs.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland would match the aim of offering boosters to all eligible adults before , but added that more Covid- restrictions may still be needed to tackle the new strain.Welsh leader Mark Drakeford also said “further steps” could be required to keep the country safe, as he encouraged people to “make having your booster a priority” amid a pledge to quicken the rollout.During his address, the Prime Minister revealed that the decision to speed up the jab rate in England would mean some NHS appointments would need to be postponed until the new year, arguing there would be “even greater” cancellationsthe wave of Omicron infections was allowed to swell.In a direct plea to GPs, doctors, nurses and others on the NHS front line, who he said had “worked incredibly hard” throughout the pandemic, Mr Johnson said: “I must ask you to make another extraordinary effort now, so we can protect you, and your colleagues, and above all protect your patients from even greater pressures next year.”Every adult over  in England who has had a second dose of a vaccine at least three months ago will be able to have their booster from Monday, the Conservative Party leader added.The NHS booking system will be open for those under

your first or second jab, now is the time to come forward.It’s more important than ever to get boosted to protect our friends, family and NHS.— Keir StarmerDecember , He ended his statement by laying out the need to move to Plan B measures – which include compulsory mask wearing in public settings, work from home guidance and the introduction of Covid passes for large venues – to guard against Omicron, before adding: “But we must go further and get boosted now.”Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Government had his party’s support to accelerate the booster programme, as he urged the public to “protect our families, friends and the NHS” by getting a top-up jab.NHS England said the turbo-charged effort would be the “biggest and fastest vaccine programme in health service history”.Chief executive Amanda Pritchard said Omicron poses a “grave” threat that could lead to a new wave of infections “even greater than those that have gone before”.She said the NHS would do “everything in our power to rise to this extraordinary challenge”.The online booster booking system – which appeared to be experiencing technical dficulties shortly after the Prime Minister’s televised address – would be “shortly open to all adults”, said Ms Pritchard, adding: “Please don’t hesitate with your booking and get boosted now.”Most ReadCountry music singers Aidan Taaffe and

By introducing it, the Executive and the Assembly will be following public health advice.“The Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Adviser have both recommended the initiative to help reduce the risk of infection in higher risk settings.”Mr Swann added that he believed the rationale for certication was “well captured” in the Executive’s Autumn Winter Covid- contingency plan issued by the First and Deputy First Minister in October.

It does, however, offer another layer of protection to our citizens.“I would encourage opponents of the scheme to spell out their preferred alternatives.”The letter continued: “Simply shouting ‘no’ whilst failing to come forward with any genuine alternatives is not a credible position and it’s not a luxury that I as Minister of Health, or any of us as MLAs, can afford in the midst of public health emergency.The emerging Omicron threat demonstrates the continued risk from the virus and further strengthens the case for certicationRobin Swann“There have been no easy answers or simple policy choices in this pandemic. That has been the case for governments across the world.“It does not serve the public interest to be ducking decisions or constantly criticising from the sidelines.“I commend certication to you as a proportionate policy, that has been introduced in other jurisdictions, and can help keep people safer, business open and support our health service this winter.“The emerging Omicron threat demonstrates the continued risk from the virus and further strengthens the case for certication.”Most ReadCountry music singers Aidan Taaffe and ‘Cowboy’ Larry Taaffe, along with third brother Michael Taaffe, all accused of raping same womanFormer journalist Martina Purdy given second chance to become a nunDUP MLA Jim Wells leading delegation of clergy to call for an alternative Covid- vaccinationAward-winning dog groomer who battered wedding guest branded ‘Jekyll and Hyde’ character by judgeJamie Dornan: People think Northern Ireland is like the Gaza StripTop VideosPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenPlayPolice chiefs refused to pay overtime to officers assigned to Noah Donohoe search operationPlayTake a look inside the former Tesco store in Belfast’s city centre which will be an event space over ChristmasLatest Northern IrelandNHS appointments to be postponed as part of Covid- booster expansionEmmerdale’s Danny crowned first king of I’m A Celeb castleBelfast Alliance councillor joins UUP: ‘My pro-Union views had left me feeling isolated,’ says Carole HowardMan arrested over  murder of Sinn Fein councillorPM sets accelerated new year booster target in face of Omicron ‘tidal wave’LatestWhat the papers say – December Johnson should face MPs over participation in No  staff quiz – LabourAustralia’s Josh Hazlewood ruled out of the second Ashes Test in AdelaideWho is I’m A Celebrity champion Danny Miller NHS appointments to be postponed as part of Covid- booster expansion,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience. I was one of two girls from the North, I didn’t get to see much of them. I was also really pleased with placing top six at my first ever show, I would’ve just been happy to complete it. The whole experience really boosted my confidence. “I really want to say a big thank you to The Beauty Edit makeup shop inFoyleside, my personal trainer, Peter Ward, and my friends and family who supported me especially my Mammy, Shauna and my best friend, Erin who travelled to Limerick with me. “Over the next year, in preparation for Miss Bikini  , I will be taking up any opportunities I can to grow my confidence and to grow as a person and grow my . I will be training so I can be the best candidate possible next year. “This year, I did the show for the experience and fun but it’s made me realise how much I want the title now and I don’t plan on letting anything distract me from it in the next year.” To support Niamh’sjourney for the next year, follow her on Instagram at:niamh.hawes  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am calling on the Education Minister to introduce regulations to cap unorm costs and provide statutory guidance to schools to ensure school unorms are made affordable for families. “A recent poll of parents showed that % were concerned about the rising costs of unorms and PE gear, while % said they getinto debt to cover the costs. Unorms and PE gear are costing parents hundreds of pounds, per-child, every year. This is unacceptable and must be addressed. With the cost of living rising, urgent action is needed to support families and I am calling on theEducation Minister to legislate to ease the burden of school unorm costs.

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead. Given the fact that only half of families agree to donatethey dont know their loved ones decision, but  out of  will support itthey know their loved one wanted to donate, Id ask everyone to please share their choice. By doing so you could save lives. You can record your decision around donation on the NHS Organ Donation Register atwww.organdonationni.info  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mayor of Derry, Alderman Grahame Warke and Bishops Donal McKeown and Brian Forster feature in the emotional film produced as a tribute to the pandemic. The film tells the story of the restrictions placed on families and friends, who never really got an opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones.  The film featues very sensitive and emotional tribute paid to a loved one who passed away by the recital of the poem Goodbye by Thornhill pupil, Tieghan Doherty, at the end of the film.  Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mayor of Derry, Alderman Grahame Warke and Bishops Donal McKeown and Brian Forster feature in the emotional film produced as a tribute to the pandemic. The film tells the story of the restrictions placed on families and friends, who never really got an opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones.  The film featues very sensitive and emotional tribute paid to a loved one who passed away by the recital of the poem Goodbye by Thornhill pupil, Tieghan Doherty, at the end of the film.  Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish. We can be Irish by birth, Irish by ancestry, Irish by geography, Irish and British, Irish by accident, Northern Irish, Irish by necessity, Irish and European, Irish by association, Irish by culture, Irish and American and Irish by choice. “The collection is a tribute to the honesty of the contributors, and I would like to record how much I appreciate their commitment. “It started as a passion project for me, a topic I was genuinely curious. “Themore I spoke with the dferent contributors and read their stories, the more I was convinced of the books signicance as a snapshot of Irish identity today. It was a real privilege to work on it, and a welcome distraction during lockdown.” She concluded: “Becoming a parent has made me think about what this book will look like for my own two children in  years time, and that was a big motivator for me.” The contributors were encouraged to be as open and honest as possible with the intention of the book being completely inclusive and non-judgmental. All were asked the same questions: What does Irish identity mean to you personally  Why do  million people worldwide embrace their Irish heritage  Are we navel-gazing  Or are there real changes in attitude taking place in Ireland and among the Irish worldwide  Published by Lfey Press,Being Irish:  views on Irish Identity, is availablefrom local independent bookshop Little Acorn Book Store on Foyle Street as well as all major bookstores and online.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish. We can be Irish by birth, Irish by ancestry, Irish by geography, Irish and British, Irish by accident, Northern Irish, Irish by necessity, Irish and European, Irish by association, Irish by culture, Irish and American and Irish by choice. “The collection is a tribute to the honesty of the contributors, and I would like to record how much I appreciate their commitment. “It started as a passion project for me, a topic I was genuinely curious. “Themore I spoke with the dferent contributors and read their stories, the more I was convinced of the books signicance as a snapshot of Irish identity today. It was a real privilege to work on it, and a welcome distraction during lockdown.” She concluded: “Becoming a parent has made me think about what this book will look like for my own two children in  years time, and that was a big motivator for me.” The contributors were encouraged to be as open and honest as possible with the intention of the book being completely inclusive and non-judgmental. All were asked the same questions: What does Irish identity mean to you personally  Why do  million people worldwide embrace their Irish heritage  Are we navel-gazing  Or are there real changes in attitude taking place in Ireland and among the Irish worldwide  Published by Lfey Press,Being Irish:  views on Irish Identity, is availablefrom local independent bookshop Little Acorn Book Store on Foyle Street as well as all major bookstores and online.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Inpho Photography.Reporter: Daragh Ó Conchúir Dec Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, All-Ireland senior camogie semi-final Slaughtneil - googletag.cmd.push Oulart-the-Ballagh- First-half goals from Wexford legends Uacutena Leacy and Ursual Jacob and eight points from play by the Kehoe twins, Shelley and Stacey, ended Slaughtneil’s bid for a fth consecutive AIB All-Ireland senior club camogie final appearance, as  champions Oulart-The Ballagh held the former three-in-a-row victors at arm’sin the second half to prevail at Donaghmore Ashbourne by - to -. Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart. Given the final margin, the opening nine minutes were hugely signicant, at the end of which the red and blacks led by - to -. After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley, who gave birth to her first child earlier this year, slotted a couple of minors for Slaughtneill as they steadied the ship and added a third after winning a free from which Louise Dougan converted to leave it - to - at the first water break.

Cliodhna Niacute Mhianaacutein reduced the margin to a goal but catastrophe struck when following Shelley Kehoe’s point, Jacob’s free from m was deflected unfortunately by Dougan beyond Jolene Bradley to put seven between them once more. That margin had grown to ten by the interval and the Robert Emmets never looked like reeling it in from - to -. They tried valiantly, as you would expect however, Therese Mallon goaling in the first minute of the second half after a block by Ceacuteat McEldowney of Katie Gallagher’s attempted clearance. Orla McNeill followed quickly with a point but the Oulart riposte was notable, Uacutena Leacy, Shauna Sinnott and Shelley Kehoe firing the last three points of the third quarter to make it - to -. They only had to avoid a collapse from that juncture and with such experience in their ranks, that was never going to happen. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley, who gave birth to her first child earlier this year, slotted a couple of minors for Slaughtneill as they steadied the ship and added a third after winning a free from which Louise Dougan converted to leave it - to - at the first water break.

Cliodhna Niacute Mhianaacutein reduced the margin to a goal but catastrophe struck when following Shelley Kehoe’s point, Jacob’s free from m was deflected unfortunately by Dougan beyond Jolene Bradley to put seven between them once more. That margin had grown to ten by the interval and the Robert Emmets never looked like reeling it in from - to -. They tried valiantly, as you would expect however, Therese Mallon goaling in the first minute of the second half after a block by Ceacuteat McEldowney of Katie Gallagher’s attempted clearance. Orla McNeill followed quickly with a point but the Oulart riposte was notable, Uacutena Leacy, Shauna Sinnott and Shelley Kehoe firing the last three points of the third quarter to make it - to -. They only had to avoid a collapse from that juncture and with such experience in their ranks, that was never going to happen. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed.

However, the Magpies led by four on referee Niall Cullenrsquos short whistle.Ramor came out after the break and pressed high, and were rewarded with three scores in the first five minutes.Kilcoo didnrsquot panic and upped the ante immediately with two Paul Devlin frees settling things. Jerome Johnston and Eugene Branagan kept the scoreboard ticking and on the th minute the brilliant Ceilum Doherty found the net after great approach play by Dylan Ward.From here to the end, Kilcoo kept playing with that high tempo and the game was put beyond the Virginia men with six minutes remaining when man of the match Jerome Johnston found the net once again.Both sides emptied their benches as the game petered out, as the Down men came away with an impressive win.Mickey Moran and his management team will take great heart from many aspects of their teamrsquos performance and will know only too well it will take this and morethey are to win against the Derry champions and reach back-to-back Ulster finals.Kilcoo assistant manager Conleith Gilligan expressed mixed emotions as the local side look ahead to the semi-final stage.ldquoThere was definitely some nice passages of play and, look, we were able to play the game at our own pace and as the competition goes on that wonrsquot be allowed to happen, he said.ldquoOnce we got our legs moving, up to the first water-break we did very well. It was just that second quarter where we were on top but we didnrsquot take enough chances that would have put the game to bed and we allowed Ramor to live in the game right up to half-time.He added: ldquoWe didnrsquot need to be the best in the country tonight, we just needed to be better than Ramor and I think we were.Kilcoo: N Kane, N Branagan, R McEvoy , A Branagan, M Rooney, Anthony Morgan , E Branagan , D Ward , Aaron Morgan, C Doherty , J Johnston , S Johnston , C Laverty, R Johnston, P Devlin .Subs used: A Branagan, T Fettes, M Hynes, C Rooney and J Clarke.Ramor United: L Brady D Bartley, B OrsquoConnell, E Somerville A OrsquoConnell, Jack Brady, M Magee, L Caffrey, E Maguire B Smith, S Cadden, C MaguireJames Brady , A Cole, S McEvoy .Subs used: G Mannion, K Maguire, P McNamee , J Bradley and L Lynch.Referee: Niall Cullen ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"New £65m Lidl supermarket in Carryduff gets green light  ","story":"THE green light has been given for the multi-million pound regeneration of the Carryduff shopping centre which could create  new jobs.The ambitious plan designed to transform the Church Road site mdash which includes a new pound.m Lidl store mdash was approved by Lisburn and Castlereagh Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Monday.Lidl submitted its new store planning application earlier this year and hopes to open the , square metre facility, creating  new jobs and parking spaces for  vehicles, by the middle of next year.In addition to the Lidl store, an additional , square metres of floorspace is available for other retailers at the expansive centre site.The new store opening is a major part of the shopping centrersquos regeneration, which has lain derelict for more than four years, with the planning application proposing the demolition of the existing buildings and the erection of three retail units, cafe, bookmakers, drive through cafe, landscaping and associated site works.Parking provision for disabled drivers is included in the development proposal alongside dedicated spaces for parents and children. Four dedicated spaces for electrical vehicles are also included.Itrsquos understood that in addition to the  jobs in the new Lidl store, a further  will be created across the other proposed retail units, with  jobs created during construction and development.Council planners are recommending to members that the application be approved with  conditions including its full construction within a five-year period.In papers submitted ahead of Mondayrsquos planning meeting, planners said they were recommending approval as the proposed retail use is considered to comply with the local development plan.They say that when the buildings are constructed, they will not adversely impact on the character of the area or have a detrimental impact on the amenity of existing residents in properties adjoining the site.ldquoAppropriate provision is made to meet the needs of cyclists and adequate facilities are made for shower and changing facilities as required for such a major employment-generating development, the papers point out.A spokesperson for Lidl said the poundm store would reflect the retailerrsquos concept design, boasting a sales floor, a shopping environment withspacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms and baby-changing facilities, as well as a bakery offering and staff facilities.ldquoOur ambitious plans to complement the site with additional retail and leisure units represent an investment of more than pound million into the area and the support of more than  jobs, he said.ldquoWersquore proud to be part of the centrersquos signicant regeneration and bring a new future of growth to the locality whilst honouring the sitersquos historical connections to the community.The spokesman added: ldquoWe hope to receive planning permission for the site and look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store early next year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.Carryduff shopping centre was a prime retail destination for many years, but since the closure of its flagship Supervalu store in , it struggled to attract an anchor tenant that would drive its growth.The formal planning application by Lidl follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in February which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community.Lidl acquired the . acre Carryduff shopping centre site in August last year as part of the retailerrsquos plans to expand its store presence across the region to more than  stores by the end of the decade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Newcastle harbour development plans  ","story":"THE redevelopment of the former generator house at Newcastle harbour has the potential to act as a catalyst to secure additional investment.Thatrsquos the assertion of Mournes councillor Willie Clarke whose comment came after Monday eveningrsquos annual meeting of the Newcastle Harbour Heritage Association.He congratulated the grouprsquos chairman Campbell Miller and the committee members on the ldquofantastic positive contribution they have made in improving the harbour over the past year.Cllr Clarke said the two main items discussed at the annual meeting included the refurbishment of the former generator house as a community hub and the provision of a new boarding pontoon that would allow disabled people to board vessels, something which he said is long overdue.The business case for the new floating pontoon recently passed through Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Clarke explained the vision for the generator house includes the provision of showers, toilets, and changing facilities for water-based recreation, alongside a meeting room for the community and harbour users.He said the business case was submitted to the local authority and approved through the so-called community transfer process.ldquoIt is essential that this building is refurbished for the local community which will be a catalyst in the development of the harbour, suggested Cllr Clarke.ldquoIn addition, it offers an excellent opportunity for the local council and the harbour community to develop a partnership to create a community hub for the area.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

The huddle of five then broke apart in the last K as they hurtled towards the finish line in break neck speed.Overall winner Owen Everardonly edged for glory in the last two strides as right to the mat it was not clear who would breach the tape first.His time of . was two seconds ahead of Matthew Neill , who was one second ahead of third-placed Eskander Turki .

Contributors include Lord Trimble, Graham Gudgin, Ray Bassett, Mike Nesbitt, Jeff Dudgeon and News Letter editor Ben Lowry. There is a foreword by Baroness Hoey. As of late , the book is available for £. through Blackstaff Press and Amazon Later concessions include the On-the-Runletters of comfort for hundreds of IRA volunteers an “amnesty” in relation to the use of forensic evidence on decommissioned weapons and the bodies of the disappeared Royal Prerogative of Mercy pardons prosecution indemnities for witnesses giving evidence at tribunals such as the Bloody Sunday enquiry and the lack of investigations into the people involved in the , bombings and , shootings of the Troubles which did not involve deaths.For some , people who were “only” injured there is to be no justice. Given the anticipated paucity of future prosecutions, except for Army veterans, we are already close to a full amnesty in all but name.Few dare to speak that name, or its iants: drawing a line, a statute of limitations, and putting the past behind us, as happened in both parts of Ireland in the s. But many of the politicians involved privately admit to wanting one. Influential public figures in Northern Ireland who have openly supported an amnesty or iants include influential Catholics and nationalists: John Larkin QC who as Attorney General proposed a stay on prosecutions former Assistant Chief Constable Peter Sheridan Dennis Bradley of the Consultative Group on the Past the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory. The former Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan called for further inquests to end after five years. Another notable advocate of an amnesty is Sir Desmond Rea, first chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.Jeff Dudgeon is a human rights activist and former Ulster Unionist Party councillor, who has advised the party on legacyIn  Secretary of State Peter Hain introduced the Northern IrelandBill which provided for a “judicially based” amnesty for OTRs and others. The Conservative Shadow Secretary of State, David Lidington, called it “an amnesty in all but name” although Hain replied saying, “an amnesty is when you let people out”. The deal in the Bill had been agreed with Sinn Féin, but when it transpired that it might apply to members of the security forces it foundered. The OTRs had to await another, secret operation put together by Tony Blair and Gerry Adams, involving  “letters of comfort” notying IRA members that they were not wanted by the police for questioning. After the existence of these letters emerged during the trial of John Downey in , the Police Service of Northern Ireland revealed that  of those who received letters were suspects in  murder cases. The Commons’ Northern Ireland Affairs Committeeinvestigated the scheme and concluded that it had “distorted the process of justice”.After years of largely futile discussion, Northern Ireland’s political parties continued to disagree on how best to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. In an attempt to break the impasse, the Northern Ireland Officein March  proposed “a new independent body focused on providing information to families and swt examinations of all unresolved deaths from the Troubles an end to the cycle of reinvestigations that has failed victims and veterans for too long ensuring that Northern Ireland veterans receive equal treatment to their counterparts who served overseas.”The NIO tacked on a reconciliation aspect, but nobody will be reconciled by one-sided, victim-focused justice. The mantra of “truth, justice and reconciliation” is a  god. Impartial professional historians alone can retrieve whatever can be established of the truth, while lack of evidence for prosecutions means that formal justice for the , families whose relatives were killed is impossible.Throughout two decades of legacy recommendations, initiatives and proposed legislation, there has been an accelerating use of the courts to advance the republican narrative, assisted by legal aid. This development has come to be termed ‘lawfare’, and its potential for expansion is limitless. It may be better than warfare, but it is politically debilitating for Northern Ireland. One wing of government, however, is not wedded to normal constitutional stability. We are told the Belfast Agreement brought peace, which is a myth that needs examined. The war ended because the IRA chose to end it, seeing a more promising path. Their demand for ‘all-party talks now’ within a ‘peace process’ proved to be remarkably perceptive. That process is continuing, and in their view can end only with the demise of Northern Ireland. Unionism, in contrast, is about maintaining the status quo and minimising concessions. This is conservative territory which is generally unappealing to the young and woke.The courts, especially in Belfast, remain open to judicial reviews, demands for the re-opening of inquests, civil suits for damages, challenges on convictions, requests for new public inquiries, all alongside Police Ombudsmaninvestigations and Strasbourg cases. The value and cost of all this activity needs to be questioned, but it will take a brave government to put in place legislation to curb the lawfare industry.A civil war was averted in the  years from . No credit is given for that, certainly not to the security forces and their dead. Sadly, young people for the most part have little empathy for those families. Solidarity when shown is largely within the republican community who use law to achieve the ends once reserved to war.During the printing of The Idea of the Union in July, the NIO published a Command Paper “Addressing the Legacy of Northern Ireland’s Past” which proposes an end to pre- criminal investigations. This has appeased veterans in the short term but at the expense of a great deal of outrage from all sides. Without, as proposed, also closing down inquests, civil suits, private prosecutions and judicial reviews, a no-prosecutions policy will do little to reduce the hurt over unfairness, the clogging of the courts or the enormous cost. The basic problem will remain unless lawfare is limited. It can be done, but the NIO will have to steel itself, face down Strasbourg challenges and accept that to rule is to decide. There is no alternative coming from the local political parties.The proposed alternative “truth recovery” bodies have the potential to be as toxic as continued criminal investigationsthere are no cost caps or time limits. The notion of reconciliation is a dead letter evenregularly touted by the NIO. What is possible is a narrowing process. It appears to be under way and has to be supported so far as it goes.Without a grand settlement, which is unlikely given the political nature of the process, the legacy debate will grind on. Nationalist lawfare cannot lose as the legal iants still remain limitless. Non-nationalist lawfare, in so far as it exists, can call into question conventional legal wisdom on the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights, but will London risk the wrath of Dublin and new legal challenges at Strasbourg On a more positive note, veterans have for the first time created a counterweight to the publicly-funded human rights industry.Agreement to dfer, putting the past behind us, is a better policy than well-funded politically-motivated archival archaeology supported by generously state-funded lawfare.• Taken from ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ edited by John Wilson Foster  William Beattie Smith.

By the time of the  World Cup, when the Northern Ireland heroes qualied for the Mexico finals, I did know that there was a dference between Catholic and Protestant, but only because I had by then become interested in politics, and had begun to read about such things.This ignorance of the tribal ide was a common experience among children whose background was middle class Protestant, and I suspect more common than it was among Catholics of a similar background, because church going levels were far, far higher among Catholics than Protestants until quite recently.In , before the Troubles had begun, already under half of Anglicans and Presbyterians in NI were weekly churchgoers. Among Catholics in NI, it was well over %. This experience is one way of illustrating how wrong Mary McAleese and the late Fr Alec Reid were to say that Protestants were brought up to hate Catholics .But even in , while I had become aware of the ide between Catholics and Protestants, I had not come to think of any such ision among the players the Northern Ireland football team, nor did I — or any of my school friends — spend so much as a moment thinking about the religious background of the other sporting names who gave us such joy in those increasingly distant days, from Alex Higgins to Barry McGuigan to Dennis Taylor..As I became older I thought more and more about how dficult it must have been for NI players of a Catholic backgroundin the s. Tensions were high in the province in the aftermath of the hunger strikes and in the run-up to the Anglo Irish Agreement and republicans were waging a campaign to destroy Northern Ireland.So many of the key figures in the NI team over the decades were from a nationalist background. I have no idea what their political affiliations were,any, and no desire to find out. But there is something particularly admirable about someone who showed loyalty to the Northern Ireland team when they might privately have wanted an all-island team.My thoughts ed to the subject this week when I was asked on the BBC Radio Ulster Nolan show to discuss comments by the former NI manager Michael O’Neill and others that the British national anthem, God Save the Queen, might not be the best song to be played before Northern Ireland games. It is a concern that unionists should take very seriously. It would be awfulfootballers and fans from a Catholic background started to drt away from the NI team — as some have always done but so far in relatively small numbers.I mentioned on Nolan that the News Letter facilitated a debate bout changing the anthem away from GSTQ more than a decade ago. The idea attracted strong opinions among NI fans, both for and against.My own view is that the national anthem is less than ideal for any one of the four home nations because it is the anthem of the UK, rather than any one of its countries.However, finding a specic anthem for Northern Ireland would prove tricky, both in getting something that had musical merit and in finding wording that was acceptable to a broad base of fans.The debate about whether or not to use the national anthem or an NI-specic one is quite separate to the suggestion by the football agent Gerry Carlile that both God Save The Queen and the Republic of Ireland’s national anthem, Amhrán na bhFiann , be played at Northern Ireland games.That would be completely unacceptable, because it would strike at the heart of what the NI team is about — which is a team that represents the northern jurisdiction of this island, the existence of which republicans themselves finally came to accept in .The mere fact of the Northern Ireland football teamspresent a considerable challenge for republicans, because those teams have very widespread and instinctive support, even among people in NI who are apolitical. They are, indeed, one of the last representations of Northern Ireland that are openly embraced.Think of what has happened with the centenary. Republicans have in effect thwarted any celebration, Beyond the front page of the News Letter, barely any local institutions have dared to so much as say Happy th! — not even ones that have Northern Ireland in their name, While London has slightly stepped up its support for the centenary at the end of the year, the anniversary is still largely invisible. If the football team is undermined, another plank of Northern Ireland le will be removed.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

High levels of vaccination among the population will greatly reduce the pressures on the NHS.They make another lockdown much less likely, and further lockdowns are to be avoided at all costs, given the huge social and financial damage that they cause.But the change in the Covid certication requirements in Northern Ireland from Monday are not widely understood and have not been sufficiently publicised. There has been a misapprehension that the old cards, given to people when they got their jabs, are not sufficient as proof.Last night the government said that such cards were sufficient. It would be utterly unfairotherwise. Older people who have been conscientious in getting jabbed often have no access to apps and might not have applied for a letter, which is a cumbersome process. It is fair to ask for proof of jabs in certain circumstances but not fair to make that proof too onerous.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The only thing is he has not listed a qualication in virology. With all his teaching experience he could go back to school and fill a gap for self-isolating and ill teachers.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe scheme requiring people to prove Covid status to gain entry to a range of hospitality venues and larges attendance events was introduced late last month with a two-week grace period to allow businesses adjust to the new requirements.Patrons wishing to access nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises will need to provide proof of vaccination or a negative lateral flow test result or evidence of a previous Covid- infection.The same rules will apply for entry to large indoor and outdoor events, such as concerts and sporting events.The regulations that give legal weight to the new system will be subject to a vote in the Stormont Assembly on Monday afternoon. vw,vw,px, px\"Health Minister Robin Swann wrote to MLAs at the weekend urging them to back the regulations in the Assembly vote It is unlikely that the law changes will be voted down.While the DUP opposed the scheme at the Stormont Executive last month, branding it a distraction that would have marginal effect in suppressing the transmission of Covid-, the coalitionrsquos other four parties supported its introduction.If the parties vote the same way in the Assembly, the regulations should pass with ease in a straight majority vote.Under the regulations, businesses who repeatedly fail to administer the scheme could face fines of up to pound,.Ahead of the Assembly debate, Health Minister Robin Swann appealed to MLAs to back the scheme. He said the emergence of the Omicron iant had strengthened the case for introducing the system.In a letter sent to all Assembly Members, seen by the PA news agency, Mr Swann called for a ldquorespectful debate on the measures and said opponents should set out their preferred alternatives.ldquoWhile I am confident this measure will be supported by a majority of MLAs, I wanted to underline some key points, not least for those who have still to make up their minds, he wrote..removeldquoFirstly, it needs to be recognised that Covid certication is a public health measure. By introducing it, the Executive and the Assembly will be following public health advice.ldquoThe Chief Medical Officerand Chief Scientic Adviserhave both recommended the initiative to help reduce the risk of infection in higher risk settings.Mr Swann added that he believed the rationale for certication was ldquowell captured in the Executiversquos Autumn Winter Covid- contingency plan issued by DUP First Minister Paul Givan and Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill in October.ldquoIn spite of the dferences of opinion in the Assembly on this measure, I would appeal for a respectful debate on Monday, he said.ldquoThe situation we are now facing with Covid demands that of us all.ldquoCertication is certainly not a panacea and will need to be complemented by widespread adherence to public health advice. It does, however, offer another layer of protection to our citizens.ldquoI would encourage opponents of the scheme to spell out their preferred alternatives. vw,vw,px, px\"DUP First Minister Paul Givan is opposed to the Covid certication scheme The letter continued: ldquoSimply shouting lsquonorsquo whilst failing to come forward with any genuine alternatives is not a credible position and itrsquos not a luxury that I as Minister of Health, or any of us as MLAs, can afford in the midst of public health emergency.ldquoThere have been no easy answers or simple policy choices in this pandemic. That has been the case for governments across the world.ldquoIt does not serve the public interest to be ducking decisions or constantly criticising from the sidelines.ldquoI commend certication to you as a proportionate policy, that has been introduced in other jurisdictions, and can help keep people safer, business open and support our health service this winter.ldquoThe emerging Omicron threat demonstrates the continued risk from the virus and further strengthens the case for certication..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Northern Ireland us Covid cert scheme set to become legally enforceable article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

For example, a le-changing illness or accident or the ending of the marriage of a family friend, it’s heartbreaking, but there’s nothing we can do about it, we can’t change it, and all the antagonism in the world solves nothing.I have a close relative who within a month was diagnosed with breast cancer, had a mastectomy and then was told she had early stage dementia. Adam Harbinson.There is nothing she can do to change things, but can she accept it  Well, without sounding uncaring one could say, what is the alternative However, to accept something we cannot change does not mean that we welcome it, how could we  No, what I’m suggesting is that to accept it, as my close relative appears to be doing, means that we don’t rage and fume, ‘Why me ’ And then we go about blaming everybody and anybody. The inescapable fact is that le isn’t fair good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people. When good things happen to good people they say, ‘God is good,’ I usually nod and add, ‘Yes, all the time.’ Isn’t that so, for wasn’t it Jesus who said, ‘He gives sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.’ That’s how it is, but it’s not generally understood.When my we died a few weeks before her th birthday it seemed that half the world was praying for her recovery and so I asked every church leader I knew why this should be. I can tell you, I got some bizarre answers, like you didn’t pray hard enough, there’s a secret sin in your le, and then the really silly ones, ‘God picks the best fruit first’, until I spoke to an old Elim pastor, who gave me the only answer there is. He said, ‘I don’t know.’So accepting the things we can’t change can be dficult,it was easy we wouldn’t have to pray for serenity. But bitterness, blaming and anger help no one.Jesus  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularMasked men armed with a hammer break into Larne home...NewsTeenage girls robbed at kne point at Ballymena bus stop...NewsLarne painter accused of ‘aggressive commercial practice’ is...NewsAccepting what we cannot change...NewsDog found with bleeding feet as Portadown man pleads guilty ...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"rare horse drawn caravan is up for auction ","story":"Advice: What should I dosomeone ’s mail is delivered to my address    Masked men armed with a hammer break into Larne homeNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleRare horse-drawn caravan is up for auctionA rare piece of history - a vintage horse-drawn caravan - is to come under the hammer at Wilsons Auctions.By Valerie MartinThursday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  The rare horse-drawn caravan which is for sale through Wilsons Auctions.The caravan, which was built in the mid to late s, is one of only a handful remaining in the world so this is an extremely unique opportunity for someone to acquire a piece of history at auction.Also known as a Romany Gypsy ledger caravan   do, the asset is property of the estate of the late Mr Jack McNeill and comes from a letime of appreciation.It is thought that the wagon was brought from Wales to Ireland by a Mr Lovell and his we during the First World War. Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom. It is estimated that this number has decreased still further since then.The wagon was transported to Bray, Co Wicklow in  where it had a starring role in the feature film of Charles Dickens’ ‘The Old Curiosity Shop’.Wilsons’ Plant, Machinery and Commercial Manager Richard McFetridge said: “I am delighted Wilsons Auctions have been entrusted to auction off such a special, historical asset. This horse drawn caravan has been meticulously cared for over the years and is a testament to its owners. I have no doubt this extremely rare wagon will be highly sought after and look forward to the outcome of the auction.”Bidding on the wagon will open on Wednesday, December  at pm. Bidders will have a full  hours to take part in the auction and place their bids, as the bidding will time out at pm on Friday, December .

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
