[{"url":null,"title":"Councils infection hotspots launch action plans bid stop surge COVID cases","story":"Share this article Leicester still has the third highest infection rate in the country despite being forced to retreat back into lockdown in June, with 55.7 people per capita getting infected a week.Bradford, in West Yorkshire, (45.8 per 100,000) and Trafford, Greater Manchester, (39.3) round out the top five for worst infection rates.It comes as the Prime Minister today announced he was \u0027squeezing the brake pedal\u0027 on easing lockdown at a Downing Street press conference.Mr Johnson warned that Covid-19 cases have started to \u0027creep up\u0027 and as a result the Government has no choice but to delay planned further casings. The PM had planned to reopen casinos, bowling alleys and allow crowds at live sporting events by August 1. But that has been pushed back to August 15 \u0027at the earliest\u0027 amid an uptick in infections across the country.Mr Johnson also revealed that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will be extended to include galleries, cinemas and places of worship.Me Johnson said: \u0027With those numbers creeping up, our assessment is that we should now squeeze that brake pedal in order to keep the virus under control.\u0027On Saturday August 1 we had hoped to reopen in England a number of the higher risk settings that remained closed. Today I am afraid we are postponing those changes for at least a fortnight.\u0027That means until August 15 at the earliest casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and the remaining close contact services must remain closed, indoor performances will not resume, pilots of larger crowds in sports venues and conference centres will not take place and wedding receptions of up to 30 people will not be permitted but ceremonies of course can continue to take place in line with Covid secure guidelines\u0027.He added: \u0027I know that he steps we are taking will be a real blow to many people, to everyone whose wedding plans have been disrupted or cannot now celebrate Eid in the way that they would wish and I am really, really sorry about that but we simply cannot take the risk.\u0027Mr Johnson said the the new rules on face coverings will apply from August 8, with the police being tasked with increasing enforcement in order to ensure members of the public comply.He said: \u0027We will also extend the requirement to wear a face covering to other indoor settings where you are likely to come into contact with people you do not normally meet such as museums, galleries, cinemas and places of worship.\u0027We now recommend face coverings are worn in these settings and this will become enforceable in law from August 8.\u0027 The announcement came as it was revealed Covid-19 cases have risen to a seven-week high in England and the R rate could now be above the dreaded level of one in both the North West and South West amid growing fears of a second wave.Government statisticians today admitted there is \u0027now enough evidence\u0027 to prove Covid-19 infections are on the up, estimating that 4,200 people are now catching the virus each day in England alone.The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which tracks the size of the outbreak by swabbing thousands of people, said the number of new daily cases was just 1,700 a fortnight ago.One in 1,500 people currently have the coronavirus - 0.07 per cent of the population. The figure does not include care homes and hospitals.Boris Johnson today said they \u0027can\u0027t ignore this evidence\u0027 as he announced he was \u0027squeezing the brake pedal\u0027 on easing the coronavirus lockdown. Number 10\u0027s scientific advisers today also upped the R rate in the UK, saying they now believe it stands between 0.8 and 0.9. It had been as low as 0.7 since May.SAGE also revealed the growth rate - the average number of people each Covid-19 patient infects - may have jumped to above one in the South West, home to the stay-cation hotspots of Devon, Cornwall and Dorset.And they said it was likely to be equally high in the North West.

He was infectious on the flight and health authorities are tracing people who sat near him.Palaszczuk said testing of 104 residents at a Pinjarra Hills aged care home – which had been subject to some concern after a worker became infected – had returned 104 negative results. Only one resident has not been tested.“We are not out of the woods,” Palaszczuk said. “The next week is still very critical so we’re going to be monitoring everything very closely over the forthcoming week.”Victorian case numbers will be announced later today amid reports the figure could be more than 650.It is anticipated the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, will also announce increased stage 4 restrictions in the state.Victorian police say they have issued 170 fines for Covid-19 breaches during the past 24 hours including to multiple people who hosted or attended parties and gatherings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1b049808eed3619a7bfa30e00799f397741ed63/0_595_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7843bd725a1912f431d4fc4cb998c44","title":"a word in your ear why the rise of audiobooks is a story worth celebrating","story":"The audiobook market is thriving. But it’s not just the convenience that has seduced readers – the best narrations are a joy in themselvesWhen I look back on 2020, audiobooks may not be the first thing I remember, but they will occupy a prominent place in the list of crutches that propped me up in this strange and perturbing year. One of the first things I did when I undertook my own Covid-19 journey in early April – three weeks of coughing and night-sweats in the spare room – was to draw the blinds and put on an audiobook. In all, I got through four novels (all repeat listens) and Tom Holland’s Dominion (narrated by Mark Meadows) during my weeks in bed. I’d read all of the novels before – Carry On, Jeeves, A Month in the Country, The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾ and Cold Comfort Farm – and it was like having old friends with me as I coughed my way towards dawn, both the familiarity of the words and the intimacy of having someone’s voice in my ears a huge comfort at a frightening time. I even managed a chuckle or two.Deloitte points out that it doesn’t appear that the growth in audiobook sales is at the expense of printed books. Audiobook listeners tend to be younger – in their 20s and 30s on average – and it may be that audiobooks are taking market share from ebooks, whose sales have been declining in recent years (Deloitte predicts that audiobook sales are likely to overtake ebooks in the next few years). The report also suggests that audiobooks could be reaching people who had previously eschewed books altogether, but were now devouring this new medium.I contacted Duncan Honeyman, senior commissioning editor at Penguin Random House and a key player in the firm’s audiobook strategy and asked him why he felt that audiobooks had done so well during lockdown, particularly given that no one is commuting any more. “Being read to is a really intimate and comforting thing,” he points out, “a human connection at a time when a lot of people are feeling isolated from one another.”There’s also the convenience factor. “You can buy and download a whole digital audiobook in an instant so you can start listening immediately, and you can multi-task so you can listen on your daily exercise, or while you’re cooking or doing the housework.” It’s striking that a quarter of smart speaker owners have listened to at least one audiobook through their device.As to what people have been listening to, Honeyman says that he has seen “a trend towards heavyweight nonfiction, with readers looking to spend their time at home learning about the world around them, with titles such as Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens and Malcolm Gladwell’s Talking to Strangers both regular fixtures in the Audible charts.”One book I loved both in print and in the superb audiobook narrated by Lenny Henry is Kit de Waal’s My Name Is Leon. De Waal is a patron of the audiobook charity Listening Books, which provides more than 50,000 people in the UK who have difficulty reading physical books with discounted access to audiobooks. I asked her why she felt audiobooks were so important. “They are different,” she says. “They enable the time-poor to stay in touch with reading. It is a bridge for those for whom reading and literacy is a challenge – for example, you don’t have to know how to pronounce big words and you can gather the meaning from context, you won’t be put off by the size of a big book.” De Waal’s son, Luke, has dyslexia, and audiobooks have been a lifeline to the world of books for him. “Audiobooks help dyslexic and other vulnerable learners to keep up with their peers – my son could read all the Harry Potter and Michael Morpurgo stories and didn’t feel excluded.”The last book I listened to was a debut thriller, The Girl Before You by Nicola Rayner. I tracked down the narrator, Lucy, an actor in Los Angeles who makes her living narrating audiobooks, and also happens to be the author’s sister (she told me recording Nicola’s book was “terrifying”). We spoke about how the burgeoning of the audiobook industry had provided new income streams for actors and had come at just the right time for her, as she has two small children. “It’s been a brilliant fit for me,” she says. “I’ve been able to spend my days with my children and set my hours to record during nap times and after bedtime. It’s given me some security in an industry where that can be hard to find – and a creative outlet. I really love telling stories. I feel very lucky.”She has continued to work throughout lockdown, although recording from home presents challenges. “When self-recording, you have to wear all the hats: the reader, the director, the engineer,” she says. “Jumping between the technical side – did that leaf blower make it on to the track? – and the artistic side, and not getting pulled out of the story, is a balancing act. Working alone can be daunting. Am I on the right track in terms of tone, pace, characterisation? Am I honouring the author’s work to the best of my ability?”I’d already read The Girl Before You in print, and the audiobook gave me a fresh perspective on the novel. It seems to me that Deloitte’s analysis of the audiobook market may miss something: that experiencing a book aurally is quite different from reading it, and that perhaps the publishing industry isn’t a zero-sum game.When I think of my favourite audiobooks – Jonathan Myerson and Mike Walker’s dramatisation of Vasily Grossman’s Life and Fate, Juliette Stevenson’s rendition of Middlemarch, Sara Collins’s magnificent reading of her own The Confessions of Frannie Langton – I recognise that these are all books that I’d loved first in print and then experienced anew through my headphones. The success of audiobooks need not come at the expense of any other format, but rather it feels like we are all recognising that a good story, well told, is a balm in these fractious days, however it finds its way into our heads and however many times we’ve read it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5371a25174b3c5a58ff6b6553d5d2a4755c664af/0_421_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e24b196fabd1b893993752d9bbf10d25","title":"bolu babalola it was mortifying meeting michael b jordan after my tweet about him went viral","story":" The writer and ‘romcomoisseur’ on her debut short story collection, romcom chemistry, and her clinch with Michael B JordanBorn and based in London, Bolu Babalola, 29, is a self-proclaimed “romcomoisseur” and writer. She worked as an assistant producer at BBC Comedy and was shortlisted by the 4th Estate B4ME prize for her debut story, Netflix and Chill. Her first short story collection, Love in Colour, retellings of mythical tales from around the world, is out this month and comes heaped with praise from authors including Meg Cabot and Candice Carty-Williams.Romcoms are a big part of your life and the inspiration for your book. Why?I feel like love and romance are seen as innately feminine and therefore inherently inferior, which is a terrible misogynistic take. We need art to have hope, especially when the world is so full of bleakness, and romcoms do that. My stories will have happy endings, but that’s also a perspective that can help shift the way you see things in real life. People think of love as a fluffy emotion, but it’s not – it’s steely and powerful and it can bring out courage in us. It’s only dismissed, I think, by people who don’t understand love and why it should be celebrated.How did your book come about? You’ve talked before about manifesting your dreams into existence…I’ve always wanted to be a writer and be around writers. I’ve been writing short stories since I was in school - they got passed round by my classmates on a weekly basis. I was working on my first novel when the idea for this collection came about. It happened almost accidentally.How did you get your break in the industry?Well, with the BBC, I applied for an internship in production and didn’t get it, but they said: “Keep in touch.” So I did. I was temping at production companies and emailed the BBC every month until eventually they got back to me. That’s how I got in. My department was lovely, but there isn’t much room to move up in the TV industry. That isn’t specific to the BBC – ersity is a problem across the landscape – but I felt I needed to leave to write my own opportunities. Plus, I was doing a part-time master’s at UCL and wanted to focus on my thesis, which was about Beyoncé’s Lemonade.Which tale in the book speaks the most to modern romance?Orin, a new tale I wrote, based loosely on bad dates I’ve had.Are you in love right now or dating?I’m Nigerian, no comment.Your parents’ love story makes it into the book and seems to be a cornerstone for you, but what do you find the most challenging aspects of modern love and dating?Social media. People can be driven crazy by somebody who hasn’t replied to a text but watches their Insta story. It amplifies insecurity… I don’t think that level of exposure is conducive to getting to know someone. I don’t do dating apps, because I don’t like the performance of them, though I have friends who got married through them.What’s next for you?Last month, out of nowhere, I was asked to interview Michaela Coel for the cover of Paper magazine. I’ve also been in the writers’ room back at the BBC, for shows coming out next year. And then there will be my debut novel.Finally, you’ve said you’re not a fan of being “nice”. Why is that?Because nice and good are not the same thing. Nice says nothing about morals or integrity or beliefs, it’s just a knowledge of how to appear affable. It’s dependent on whoever is calling you nice, it doesn’t stand on its own. I’m a dark-skinned black woman living in the western world. There’s a lot of stuff that could really affect me, but nice isn’t something I should work for.

While she can’t be faulted for topicality, it seems unlikely that many people will want to spend more time than they need to thinking about a deadly virus. This would be a shame as, for the most part, The Pull of the Stars is a beautifully modulated historical novel. There is also the comfort – for most of us – of how much more likely we all are to survive the current emergency than anyone on the 1918 Dublin maternity fever ward, the setting for Donoghue’s 13th novel. For a small cast, the death count here is high.As anyone who has read Donoghue’s internationally bestselling novel Room – inspired by the grotesque Josef Fritzl case – will know, she is quick to draw the reader in. After only four short sentences, we can already smell the “dung and blood” of the Dublin streets as nurse Julia Power cycles to work at an understaffed hospital in the city centre. Donoghue’s prose is visceral, and the sense of peril in the cramped, tiny ward is compelling. The first part of the story takes place over 14 hours as women weakened by flu contort themselves in labour. There is tenderness and even beauty amid the horror, as nurses manoeuvre the expectant mothers into bizarre positions to accelerate labour and thus save lives.Nurse Power has been sent a young volunteer helper for the day, Bridie Sweeney, who is so ignorant she is astonished to feel a baby moving inside its mother’s body: “I thought it only came to life once it was out,” she admits.Donoghue has abandoned quotation marks in this book. She has said she wanted to give the dialogue a “hallucinatory effect”, and it certainly conjures up Nurse Power’s exhaustion.Where the novel falls down is in Donoghue’s weakness for lurid melodrama. Attending the postmortem of a mother who died before her baby could be born, Nurse Power gazes at the foetus: “I wept for him, and his mother on the slab, and his five brothers and sisters gone before him, and the seven orphaned ones, and their bereft father.” This may simply have been the state of things, but Donoghue appears at pains to ensure the reader never forgets about grief and suffering. Poverty and flu are not the only cause of pain, of course – the first world war is still going on during the three days of the novel’s action. Nurse Power reflects on war neurosis and “the Englishwoman who lost her mind in an air raid and decapitated her child”. The effect of so much blood and guts is quite deadening, and lessens the impact of the final tragedy in the book. There is also a subplot featuring a doctor on the run from police, but this fails to really go anywhere.This feels like a wasted opportunity, given that Donoghue is such a capable writer. Early on, an exhausted doctor “held on to the stethoscope around his neck with two hands, as a swaying passenger on a tram might grip an overhead strap”. It is this ability of Donoghue’s to conjure a whole world in a short phrase that makes the book worth reading one only wishes she could occasionally have exercised a little more restraint.• The Pull of the Stars by Emma Donoghue is published by Picador (£16.99).

Who could resist?Friday was one of those mornings when, from the pier – with the new morning’s golden sand stretching away in both directions and the first arrivals bashing in the poles of wind breaks – you could see Skegness as 30-year-old Billy Butlin must have seen it when he took the train to the sleepy Victorian resort in 1927. Butlin, who had a travelling fair, took one look at Skegness and decided he had finally found his promised land.Well before he built his first holiday camp a mile up the coast, Butlin, from his home in a caravan in a field of cows near the seafront clock tower, brought to Skegness not only Europe’s first dodgems but wall-of-death motorcyclists, a flea circus, high ers and a zoo. Skegness was sold as a place where anything might be possible.In nearly a century since, that can-do vision had hardened into something more dispiriting. Last month, in a survey by Which?, Skegness came out bottom of 100 British coastal destinations for customer satisfaction, receiving a one-star rating, the lowest possible, for its attractions, scenery, peace and quiet and value for money.There are 28,000 caravans that line the coast from here up to South Somercotes. Bookings are in heavy demand.“For a long time,” Yates suggests, “such domestic holidays have been the preserve of an older age group. What we are seeing from our feedback is a different sort of customer coming. Families with young children, who might have gone abroad for years. The hope is that what has been forced on people this year could become a lasting habit.”Down on the beach – where flesh is already reddening by 11 in the morning, and there is plenty of space to accommodate social distancing – I talk to one or two families who have changed their plans in this way. Richard Leigh, 42, from Northampton, last came to this coast as a child. He and his wife, Ann, and their two young children were due to be in Spain this summer, but are glad they have struck lucky with some Costa del Sol weather in Lincolnshire. “If you could guarantee it was going to be like this every day, it would be a no-brainer, wouldn’t it?”The stallholders of Skegness know that wisdom only too well. Darryl Woods has had the concession for children’s rides and a bouncy slide up on the pier for eight years. The sunshine is welcome, he says, but it’s going to take much more fine weather to recover what has been lost in the past months of shutdown. “And it’s not as if last year was great either.”At the other end of the promenade, past the stalls selling edible pebbles and Skegness rock and marshmallow willies, past the morning queues at the vodka slushy bars, next to the statue of the town’s Jolly Fisherman mascot, John Stead is setting up his sunglasses pitch. He fondly recalls the days when the Radio One roadshow used to pack the beach.At least the sun is shining, I suggest.“Nah, it’s too hot,” he says. “Everyone’s on the beach, rather than up here.”“Overcast,” says the sunglasses seller, “with a chance of drizzle.”Butlin’s itself, just along the coast, was originally imagined to cater for just that eventuality.“I think we’ve actually opened at just the right time because things are starting to loosen off with regards to live entertainment,” he says. “So from next week, we’re probably the only place in the country that will be able to offer a pantomime.” There is a new outdoor stage for Diversity, the Britain’s Got Talent winners.The huge challenge, he feels, remains to sell this stretch of coast as an out-of-season destination. Other traditional coastal resorts, particularly those in closer proximity to the capital, navigated that shift better than Skegness. Whitstable has become a foodie destination, with its microbreweries and oyster festival. With the help of Tracey Emin, Margate managed to make ramshackle retro. Here, the money that flooded into the town from the holiday fortnights of the east Midlands, ended with the closure of the mines in the 1980s and has never properly been replaced.Former Skegness mayor Sid Dennis, 69, fervently believes that reinvention is happening. Dennis is chairman of the town’s latest funding committee, with plans for a £30m redevelopment, that hopes to tap into the government’s promises to regenerate coastal towns.The Dennis family has been in the recycling – scrap metal – business here since 1888. His grandfather owned one of the first caravan sites on the coast here. As well as his day job at the scrapyard, Dennis has been a standup comedian for 30 years, with a previous residency at Skegness Butlins.Dennis’s bread and butter is waste collection for the resorts. During the pandemic, he says, his regular collection of 4,000 industrial bins went down to 200 overnight.“We are used to factoring in bad weather, floods, snow, but you can’t factor in waking up to fuck all,” he says. “For a week, not a cheque dropped on the mat. I said to my wife – who is also my PA – stop everything going out, all the direct debits. We’ve been married 46 years and when she’s anxious, she calls me husband. ‘Husband, whatever is going to happen?’ she said.” Don’t worry, Dennis replied, they will be in touch.Dennis believes that the crisis, and the renewed interest in staycations, has presented an opportunity as well as a challenge, but only if the town can seize it. “Billy Butlin was always an innovator,” he says, “and there is a lot of vision in the town still.”With some zeal, he talks me through the out-of-season possibilities of the “wild coast” harking back to the health benefits of the big skies and sea air.“People think Skegness is a bit working class,” Dennis says, “and it is. People work hard and they want to come and enjoy themselves. I’ve got a bit of money but I still love walking along the seafront having fish and chips out of the bag. That’s our street food. But there needs to be an extra offer.”What success Skegness has had in changing its traditional image has centred around the annual SO arts festival, which – until plans were scuppered this year – brought a broader demographic to the town. “Publicans always tell me they always know when SO is on,” he says, with a laugh. “Because suddenly they have people ordering starter, main, pudding, bottle of wine. Which makes a change from the early bird special between five of them.”The fund committee’s aim is to build on that possibility, with a redevelopment of the seafront that will include a new permanent indoor arts pavilion and cinema (as well as a dramatic observation tower). He gestures to the weather outside: “We can’t rely on this.”He admits that not everything in the Which? survey was wide of the mark. Dennis has a holiday flat in Crete. He would love above all to import a Greek sense of hospitality to Lincolnshire.“If you order a cup of coffee, the Greek waiter carefully turns the cup in its saucer to you, just so,” he says, “and gives you a little biscuit. Here they whack a mug down in front of you while they are talking to a mate on their mobile phone.”His committee plans an FE college that offers a degree or a diploma in hospitality. “Training brings pride. And if you can get back that pride, you can get that Greek cafe culture here,” he insists. “Get a farmer’s market going, an antiques festival, a steampunk festival. I still think,” he says, with the kind of Billy Butlin enthusiasm that comes from closing your eyes and taking a deep gulp of seaside air, “despite everything, this town can offer whatever people like.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74de7eeae45fbe3278b4215caab48f88f85f00c7/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=078c8b98a275c814c3aef8819a7238c2","title":"wfh the coffee and prosecco van coming to a british street near you","story":"Deprived of office clients, food businesses are using vans, milk floats and even bikes to take their wares on the road“Stop me and buy one” is a slogan traditionally used by ice-cream sellers. Now you may be as likely to find coffee, bread, cakes and sandwiches being sold up and down your street.Growing numbers of cafes and caterers forced to stop trading during the lockdown are investing in vans with espresso machines or repurposing milk floats to deliver to customers working from home.Many are hoping to capitalise on the burgeoning community spirit in cities, sparked by #ClapForCarers and the WhatsApp neighbourhood groups that sprang up when lockdown began.In south London, Zoe Watkins, co-founder of Livewire Kitchen, is closing two of her three cafes and switching to a van – Little Livewire – selling coffee, superfoods and natural, energy-boosting drinks.“We’re talking to people locally to ask them where they want us to go,” Watkins said. “Each area has a Facebook community and we’re talking to them, saying we can come to one place every Wednesday morning, another place on Thursday, and so on.”The van has sides that fold down to reveal an espresso machine, and has an onboard water supply. It takes about 20 minutes to set up and Watkins hopes a regular meeting point close to people’s homes will help cement community ties.This is just one of many similar operations. The owners of the Dusty Knuckle bakery and cafe in east London have repurposed a milk float to take bread and pastries to customers across the city. They publish a weekly schedule of where they will be so customers can pop out to browse the wares outside their front doors. The experiment appears to be a success, with socially distanced queues of people waiting to be served.At least 3,000 catering vans in the UK could provide a similar local service but are hampered by red tape, according to the Nationwide Caterers Association (NCASS). In addition to hygiene and food standards checks, mobile caterers also need a street-trading licence from every local authority area they operate in.“It’s something we expect to increase over the next few months, but the problem is licensing,” NCASS director Mark Laurie said.“There’s a lot of confusion about what is legal and what catering vans are allowed to do,” Laurie said. “Councils are so busy and don’t have enough staff to deal with applications.” Click-and-collect services don’t need to be licensed, but stopping in the street requires a permit, although private land is exempt.“There could be a major shift in our economy. It has been happening a lot in villages – fish and chip vans doing rounds, a different village each day. But it hasn’t happened so much in the cities. We think we should be able to apply for pavement licences.“The viability of central London restaurants and food-to-go places is in question because office workers aren’t there. It makes sense to go to where the customers are.”Many workers are unlikely to return to their offices for months – if they ever do. Google staff will work from home until at least July 2021. Coca-Cola, Unilever, Vodafone, Pearson, KPMG and a host of other firms said last week they would not reopen offices until next year at the earliest. Pret a Manger is closing 30 of its 410 shops and other firms are likely to follow as the government furlough scheme ends.On Saturday, the government changed its guidance to encourage employees back into workplaces in order to help restart the commuter economy. It had been under pressure from Conservative MPs such as Iain Duncan Smith who said employers were “absolutely bloody mad for not getting more employees back”.That represents a huge untapped market, says NCASS, but many members are uncertain about the complex rules governing street trading.Pete Hewitt, who reached the 2015 MasterChef final and won at the European Street Food Awards last year, has a Japanese-inspired food truck called Homeboys which is usually seen at food festivals but has been out on Nottingham streets. “We would have done more but the licensing was very complicated,” he said. “At the beginning of lockdown, we found a disused old restaurant and started selling there but we did have complaints. The licence costs £180 a year, which is fine if you’re doing it all the time but at the moment no one knows what’s going to happen.”In London, Watkins’s mobile van is being made by the Big Coffee, which sells converted Piaggio vans to street-food traders and others such as Yorkshire Tea, Upper Crust, Unilever and Subway for £10,000 to £70,000. It also converts buses, taxis and VW campervans and offers a £6,000 pedal-powered espresso trike for fit baristas.“We’ve been going for 20 years and this is the busiest we’ve been,” the firm’s director Rob Dixon said.“It’s not just coffee – we also do prosecco vans, craft beers, cocktails, food, ice-cream. I spoke to someone the other day who is developing an app on which people can order coffees and he’ll do a delivery round.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/219de520ab37dadfe23bafbdb1b39dc7e87b8ad5/0_17_2364_1418/master/2364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3852d9e2669c85f8a340335fdb2a856d","title":"a nuclear arms race in space it seems weve learned nothing from hiroshima","story":"As the world marks the 75th anniversary of the dropping of the atom bomb on Japan, it must wake up to the new rearmamentRussia’s apparent test-firing of an anti-satellite weapon in outer space on 15 July, as alleged by the US and Britain, could be dismissed as another of Vladimir Putin’s annoying provocations. That would be a mistake. The alleged new space weapon should be seen in the broader context of a rapidly evolving, hi-tech, high-risk international arms race involving all the major nuclear powers that, largely undiscussed, is spinning out of control.This week sees the 75th anniversary of the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that killed over 200,000 people, but the absence of public debate or a sense of alarm about the grim advent of sophisticated new nuclear, hypersonic, cyber and space weapons is striking. In the decades after Hiroshima, noisy anti-nuclear “ban the bomb” protests by CND and others ned the globe. Today, by comparison, an eerie silence reigns.Yet in relaunching US space command last year, Donald Trump also pointed to space as the next great-power battlefield. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance will not deploy weapons in space but is obliged to defend its interests, which include 2,000 orbiting satellites. For Nato, too, space is now an “operational domain”.New and “improved” nuclear weapons are proliferating in parallel with the race for space. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), nine states – the US, Russia, China, Israel, the UK, France, India, Pakistan and North Korea – together possess about 13,400 weapons. While the overall total is falling, “retired” warheads and bombs are being replaced by more powerful, versatile devices, such as smaller, “use-able” US battlefield nukes.“All these states are either developing or deploying new weapon systems or have announced their intention to do so,” Sipri’s annual report said. The US and Russia each possessed about 1,550 deployed, long-range weapons, while China had about 300. Both the US and Russia were spending more and placing greater reliance on nuclear weapons in future military planning, it said, while China was rushing to catch up.“China is in the middle of a significant modernisation of its nuclear arsenal. It is developing a so-called nuclear triad for the first time, made up of new land- and sea-based missiles and nuclear-capable aircraft. India and Pakistan are slowly increasing the size and ersity of their nuclear forces,” Sipri reported. Meanwhile, North Korea continued to prioritise its military nuclear programme, while conducting “multiple” ballistic missile tests.“Instead of planning for nuclear disarmament, the nuclear-armed states appear to plan to retain large arsenals for the indefinite future, are adding new nuclear weapons, and are increasing the role such weapons play in their national strategies,” a Federation of American Scientists survey said. It estimated about 1,800 warheads were kept on high alert, ready for use at short notice. Russia claims to lead the world in developing hi-tech weaponry. Speaking in July, Putin boasted that Russia’s navy was being equipped with nuclear-powered hypersonic cruise missiles, which supposedly have unlimited range, and submarine-launched underwater nuclear drones.Despite celebrated speeches supporting a nuclear-free world, Barack Obama authorised a $1.2tn plan to upgrade America’s nuclear triad while pursuing strategic arms reductions via the 2010 New Start treaty with Russia. Trump has doubled down, at the same time abandoning arms control pacts. His 2018 nuclear posture review proposed an extra $500bn in spending, including $17bn for low-yield, battlefield weapons.Trump looks set to scupper New Start, which expires in February, on the spurious ground that it does not reduce China’s much smaller arsenal (which it was never intended to do). He has previously reneged on the 2015 Iran nuclear treaty, the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, and is said to favour resumed nuclear testing in Nevada in defiance of the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban treaty.Like Britain and other signatories, the US continues to fail to fulfil its obligation under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty “to pursue nuclear disarmament aimed at the ultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals”. Despite its acute financial situation, Britain remains committed to replacing its Trident missile system at an estimated cost of £205bn over 30 years.While nuclear weapons have not been used since 1945, great-power military flashpoints are increasing the risk that they might be. These potential triggers include the South China Sea, Taiwan, the India-Pakistan and India-China borders, the US-Israel-Iran conflict, North Korea and Ukraine.Heightened international tensions and collapsing arms-control regimes only partly explain the accelerating pace of nuclear rearmament. Resurgent nationalism, authoritarian rightwing populism, revived or new territorial rivalries (as in space), the bypassing of the UN and multilateral institutions, and a shifting economic and geopolitical power balance are all aggravating factors.But so, too, is amnesia. Seventy-five years after Armageddon was visited upon the people of Japan, the world seems to have forgotten the truly existential horror of that moment. A history lesson, and a renewed debate, are urgently needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/406b476b08d583585324dfb8f4d46bcacc8c8c14/0_218_2545_1526/master/2545.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f4df64b0a9096548c29a0df71f4f4690","title":"now teachers sound alarm over plans to reopen schools","story":"Union calls on ministers to convince staff and parents that it is safe to start a new year in September as expert warns on spread of the virusGovernment plans to reopen all schools in September were called into question by leading scientists and the head of a major teaching union last night amid signs that cases of Covid-19 are increasing again at an alarming rate.Despite imposing new restrictions on people meeting indoors in parts of the north of England on Thursday – and postponing plans to allow bowling alleys, casinos, skating rinks and other venues to reopen a day later – ministers insist that reopening schools fully early next month remains a top priority.But in a sign of growing concern and uncertainty about the strategy, Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, which represents more than 300,000 teachers across the UK, said the government needed to take urgent action to convince parents and teachers that schools would be safe.While insisting he was not calling for a postponement, Roach told the Observer: “In light of recent changes to plans for relaxing lockdown measures, the government needs to provide greater clarity to school leaders, teachers and parents about what this will mean for the reopening of schools in September.”“If schools are to reopen safely, the government will need to give them clarification about what they need to do to take account of the latest scientific evidence and advice, as well as sufficient time to review and, if necessary, adjust their reopening plans.”Meanwhile, Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it had become clear that there is a link between closing schools and controlling the spread of the virus. “The evidence is clear that schools are important in the spread of Covid-19,” he said. “Our studies show that, across Europe, closing schools was the single factor most strongly associated with drops in infection rates.”Hunter added that while inidual risks to children and teachers were probably low, school transmission was likely to push up general infection rates, so the disease would rise exponentially again. “Would re-opening schools increase the spread of Covid-19 in the population? Yes. I think it would very probably do that.”The chairman of Sage’s sub-group on pandemic modelling, Graham Medley, said it could come down to a choice between reopening schools and shutting other venues such as pubs. “Most people think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households,” Medley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.However, he cited Whitty’s warning about the limits of reopening society. “So closing some other networks, some other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools,” Medley said. “It’s a matter of prioritising. Do we think pubs are more important than schools?”Virologist Jonathan Ball, of Nottingham University, also warned about the risks of reopening schools as infection levels are rising. “We don’t yet understand whether children play a major role in transmission either to each other, or to the wider community, though we do know that they can be very good incubators and spreaders of viruses.”The fear is that infection rates will start to increase in autumn because coronaviruses are seasonal and levels peak in winter months, he added.“There is real concern now about how easy it will be to safely open schools without threatening the wider community. It may well be that there is a quid pro quo to be made and we have to stop going to pubs or restaurants. It is not just about educating children and preserving their mental health, after all. It’s also about allowing parents to go to work as well.”One concern for teachers is the wearing of face masks. While this is compulsory for children of 11 and over in shops and on public transport, the guidance is that masks are not necessary for pupils or teachers in schools. One union source said this “makes no sense at all”, adding that parents would justifiably query apparent inconsistencies in the rules.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have set out the controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission. This does not include the wearing of face coverings as we believe the system of controls laid out adequately reduced the risk of transmission to both staff and students.”Another DfE source said ministers remained committed to schools reopening, but added: “In the event of a local outbreak, Public Health England health protection team or local authority may advise a school or number of schools to close temporarily to help control transmission. Schools will need a contingency plan for this eventuality. This may involve a return to remaining open only for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers, and providing remote education for all other pupils.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bbad9c808b64ceca57c63eba6bb6697aefceef/0_42_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003e5af1961f6baa40fc3d3d083dc1be","title":"alan parker a life in pictures","story":"Film director Alan Parker has died at the age of 76.

On other occasions I might roast figs and add them to a walnut and honey ice-cream to serve with a glass of grappa or bake bananas and stir them into thick yogurt to freeze.But if I am away from home, armed with a less-than-ideal kitchen, I am up for something simpler: a granita or perhaps a tarted-up tub of commercial ice-cream.I might gather everyone round the table to top and tail some blackcurrants, then bring the berries to the boil with sugar and a little water, and ripple them through good vanilla ice-cream from a tub. We could add crushed walnuts toasted with a little honey, or some biscuit crumbs or sugar-encrusted trifle sponges. Then again, I might chop up some interesting chocolate – say roasted hazelnut or mint – to embellish a tub of basic vanilla. The crisp nuggets of chocolate turn it into a sort of instant stracciatella – one of the very best but often most difficult ices to track down.Granitas are straightforward just remember to beat them with a fork every now and again as they freeze so that they become crystalline rather than freeze into a giant lollipop. And I’m not sure I’d say no to an updated banana split, served with fresh cherries tumbling down the mountain of bananas and whipped cream.Refreshing, quick and simple. Serves 6Make a sugar syrup by bringing the caster sugar and water to the boil in a small pan. Lower the heat and simmer until the sugar is completely dissolved, then remove from the heat and leave to cool. You can speed the process up by lowering the saucepan into a bowl of cold water and ice cubes.Remove the rind from the watermelon and discard. You will end up with about 1 kg of flesh. Roughly chop the watermelon, then process to a thick slush in a blender or food processor.Stir the sugar syrup into the crushed watermelon, then pour into a stainless steel or rigid plastic freezer box and freeze for an hour. Using a fork, gently bring the crystals of frozen mixture that lie around the edges into the middle, then return it to the freezer.Do not let the granita freeze into one vast ice cube. Instead, encourage the crystallisation by regular, gentle mixing. Continue gently stirring the frozen crystals into the scarlet liquid every hour, until the granita is entirely, but lightly, frozen into millions of tiny crystals. It should take about 4 or 5 hours.The easiest of ices to make and for which no machine is needed. Makes 1 litre, serves 8 or moreSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.

We have already seen sibling rivalry, feuds, treachery, marital discord and public moral outrage.But the “writers’ room” churning out scripts for “The Murdochs” in a backroom somewhere has pulled off another triumph this weekend. James Murdoch, the media magnate’s younger son, has walked away from the business that has shaped his life and out of the control of his 89-year-old Melbourne-born father.Citing differences over the editorial lines taken by the newspapers in the family’s News Corp conglomerate, which include the Wall Street Journal and New York Post and the Australian, as well as the Times and the Sun in Britain, the youngest of Murdoch’s three children by Anna Maria Torv, his second wife, announced that he would no longer sit on the board of directors.“My resignation is due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions,” read an official statement from the 47-year-old.Yet if the appeal of such a long-running family drama rests on its ability to surprise the audience, then the latest twist in the Murdoch fortunes lacks real shock value. James’s dislike of his father’s view on climate change – in short, that we don’t need to worry unduly – has become increasingly evident, as have his own leanings towards progressive politics.For veteran media expert Roy Greenslade, who has charted every turn in the patriarch’s career, this weekend’s episode was no bolt from the blue. “It has been obvious for a couple of years that James has been unhappy about his father’s – and therefore the company’s – stance on climate change,” he said. “He and his wife have been vocal critics of Rupert’s belief that the change is not the result of human activity.”The bushfires that ravaged Australia at the beginning of the year are ostensibly at the centre of James’s decision. In January, he and his wife, Kathryn, an environmental campaigner, issued a statement expressing disappointment at coverage by Fox News and other News Corp outlets.An anonymous former colleague described how her initial scepticism about James’s talents proved unfounded. Speaking this weekend from LA, she said: “My hope is that James will now use his resources to create antidotes to Fox News,” adding that his faith that he could change the views of his father and brother may well have just run out.James’s views on American politics are also a factor. The most liberal Murdoch donated to Unite America and to the Anti-Defamation League, both liberal causes. He has given cash to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, while, in contrast, the family’s broadcast news outlet helped to elect the current incumbent. “James has also been anything but a fan of Donald Trump and of his cable TV cheerleader, Fox News,” said Greenslade.The outspoken conservative news channel was founded in 1996, when Murdoch was at a peak of his influence. It became front-page material itself four years ago when its former boss, the late Roger Ailes, was alleged to have assaulted more than 20 women. It has since earned heavy criticism for misleading messages on the threat posed by Covid-19.Murdoch Senior now presides over a reduced Fox Corporation, which recently sold much of its TV and film interests to Disney, and also over News Corps’s national and regional newspapers and wire services. His elder son, Lachlan, 48, is now co-chairman of News Corp and last year was named executive chairman and chief executive of Fox Corp.“The resignation of James now clears the path for Lachlan to inherit the leadership of News Corp after Rupert’s death and, just possibly, before it. But, given the state of the newspaper industry, it is unlikely to be a welcome inheritance,” said Greenslade.And inheritance is the key. As fans of the hit TV show Succession will understand, when you have a family business on this scale, the question of legacy dominates. Playwright Lucy Prebble, currently working on the third season of the drama said to be inspired by the Murdochs, was aware of odd resonances this weekend. “Although this is obviously a spoiler, there are uncanny echoes with the end of season 2 and Kendall’s public stand against his father,” she said.Murdoch started to build his news empire, entering the British media market in the late 1960s, after acquiring a stable of Australian titles. This period inspired another recent dramatic hit, James Graham’s West End and Broadway play, Ink, now being turned into a film. “I want something loud … less hoity-toity and artsy fartsy and fancy pantsy … Margins, bottom lines, the figures are what counts,” Graham has a thrusting, 38-year-old Murdoch explain to the editor of the Sun, urging it to conquer the Daily Mirror.By 1973, Murdoch was financially victorious, expanding into America and founding News Corporation, one of the largest media groups in the world, seven years later. He is currently thought to be worth $17bn.Murdoch’s great age has heightened speculation about future leadership. Last year, David Dimbleby gave a lengthy overview in his podcast The Sun King. Murdoch was, Dimbleby said, “an enigma” with a “risk-taking, buccaneering approach to newsgathering and the use of that power to influence public attitudes”.Last month the BBC television documentary series, The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty, presented the story so far to a wider audience. Its focus was the perceived battle between Anna’s three children, with Elisabeth, 51, described as her father’s probable favourite, and perhaps the most suited to filling his shoes.“In the usual sexist way, a lot of the rivalry has involved the brothers,” said Simon Bunney, assistant producer of the documentary. “While James’s criticisms of Fox News are clearly genuine, there is a question about his posture on politics. He is politically closer to people like David Cameron and George Osborne than he is to the left.”Researchers also detected that James’s ambitions were thwarted during the Disney purchase of the Murdoch film businesses. “It had clearly been difficult for him to recover from the phone-hacking scandal in Britain that resulted in the closure of the News of the World, but to some extent he had managed that. With his techy interests, he was thought to be keen to work more with TV and film,” said Bunney.James was not the first child to step outside the fold, of course. Elisabeth pulled away in 2001, becoming a successful independent television executive after working under her father at BSkyB during the 1990s. Her second marriage, to PR guru Matthew Freud, great-grandson of Sigmund, also brought her inside another more famous dynasty, but a liberal one, and created new barriers.She publicly raised an eyebrow when her father left her mother to marry a former office intern, Wendi Deng, the woman who went on to give Murdoch his two youngest children, teenagers Grace and Chloe. Elisabeth, who is now the executive chairman of a production company, also has a third, lower-profile elder half-sister. Journalist Prudence Murdoch, 62, is the daughter of her father’s first wife, Patricia Booker,Since Murdoch’s wedding to Deng in 1999, Elisabeth has stood in attendance, bouquet in hand, for the latest of her father’s brides: this time Mick Jagger’s ex-wife, Jerry Hall, the former model.Curiosity about the personal lives of this family inevitably drives public interest, but it is their father’s impact on news coverage and on international politics that still makes them important to monitor.Britain’s Murdoch newspapers are credited by many with giving Tony Blair the chance to lead Britain through the late 1990s, and in turn, they are judged responsible for shifting public opinion away from Gordon Brown to David Cameron.It was under Cameron’s premiership that Murdoch had his infamous “humblest day”, giving testimony to the Leveson inquiry into press abuses carried out by his British newspapers. As the head of the family approaches his 90th birthday next March, there is still scope for further drama, with minor characters ready to step into the frame. Perhaps daughters Chloe, Grace, or even Prudence, will emerge as players. Deng, however, with her alleged romantic hankering for Tony Blair, and her lively defence of her elderly husband during a parliamentary committee session, is surely worthy of her own spin-off series."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/081a47c5463a394453f91de2e1cb592e2c12f726/0_246_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a8a3ff266741c6ce6ce4ef93020e58c","title":"james murdoch resigns board news corporation","story":"James Murdoch has resigned from the board of News Corp, the media company said on Friday, citing “disagreements” over editorial content.The resignation severs Murdoch’s final formal link to the media empire his father, Rupert Murdoch, created.

Lachlan Murdoch, 48, is seen as the heir apparent.It was not immediately apparent what editorial content might have fueled James Murdoch’s decision to step down. However, he and Lachlan have recently indicated discomfort with the conservative slant of much of News Corp and Fox Corp.Rupert Murdoch’s Australian newspapers have repeatedly been accused of propagating climate “misinformation” and giving a platform to climate science deniers, including during Australia’s recent bushfires crisis.Andrew Bolt, a prominent political commentator and blogger for News Corp Australia, is known for his derision of climate change science and attacks on climate “alarmists”.News Corp Australia’s executive chairman, Michael Miller, has previously said the company does not “deny climate change or the gravity of its threat”.Earlier this year, James Murdoch and his wife Kathryn criticized coverage of the climate crisis in the family’s outlets.“Kathryn and James’s views on climate are well-established, and their frustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage of the topic is also well-known,” a spokesperson for the couple said. “They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia given obvious evidence to the contrary.”Kathryn Murdoch is a vocal environmentalist. She has said she was inspired to act after seeing former US vice-president Al Gore speak at a Fox News retreat.“I decided to switch everything I was doing,” she told the New York Times. “I wanted to be able to look my children in the eye and say ‘I did everything I could.’”James Murdoch has also publicly criticized Fox News.“There are views I really disagree with on Fox,” he told the New Yorker last year.On Friday, a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission said: “On 31 July 2020, News Corporation received a letter from James R Murdoch tendering his resignation from the company’s board of directors, effective immediately.“Mr Murdoch informed the company that his resignation was due to disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”In a statement Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch said: “We’re grateful to James for his many years of service to the company.

ByteDance’s concession will test whether Trump’s threat to ban TikTok is a negotiating tactic or whether he is intent on cracking down on a social media app that has up to 80 million daily active users in the US.ByteDance was previously seeking to keep a minority stake in the US business of TikTok, which the White House had rejected. Under the new proposed deal, ByteDance would exit completely and Microsoft would take over TikTok in the US, the sources said. Some ByteDance investors that are based in the US may be given the opportunity to take minority stakes in the business, the sources added.The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Trump’s threat had stalled negotiations. “Before Mr Trump’s remarks, the two sides believed the broad strokes of a deal could be in place by Monday,” the paper reported on a possible TikTok-Microsoft sale, citing unnamed sources.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Trump would accept ByteDance’s concession.

The plan allows for another US company other than Microsoft to take over TikTok in the United States, the sources added.As relations between the United States and China deteriorate over trade, Hong Kong’s autonomy, cyber security and the spread of the novel coronavirus, TikTok has emerged as a flashpoint in the dispute between the world’s two largest economies.ByteDance has been considering a range of options for TikTok amid US pressure to relinquish control of the app, which allows users to create short videos with special effects and has become wildly popular with US teenagers.ByteDance acquired the Shanghai-based video app Musical.ly in a $1bn deal in 2017 and relaunched it as TikTok the following year. ByteDance did not seek approval for the acquisition from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security risks.Reuters reported last year that CFIUS had opened an investigation into TikTok.The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves US military or intelligence personnel.

Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Back in Boulmer, the Fishing Boat Inn is the perfect pit stop – listen out for waves crashing on the rocks below. • Doubles from £140 B\u0026ampB, thefishingboatinnboulmerThe National Trust-protected swathe of coast comes with minimal facilities (car parking, toilets and a limited menu at the café at Knoll beach), but there are four miles of perfect beach. On South Beach, with views to Old Harry’s Rocks, you’ll also find the Pig on the Beach. The produce of its extensive kitchen garden isn’t just the preserve of hotel guests extended lunches allow visitors to head here, too. Mains start at £18 and all the food is sourced from within a 25-mile radius. • Doubles from £269-room only, thepighotelNorth Norfolk is home to dunes, marshland and uncrowded beaches. Brancaster’s beach may seem (relatively) pulsating with activity, but take a left and you’ll head into the glorious marshland of Titchwell RSPB nature reserve. Close by is Titchwell Manor, a Victorian farmhouse that has reopened with a restaurant. In Thornham, the next village along, you can click and collect fish, chips and halloumi arancini. A fish dinner starts at £10, with gluten-free options. • Doubles from £140 B\u0026ampB, titchwellmanorJust inland from Chesil Beach, with red sandstone cliffs marking the start of the Jurassic coast, Burton Bradstock is one of those fossil-studded beaches locals like to keep to themselves. It’s over a mile long, with a great café, dipping down from the South West Coastal path en route to Lyme Regis. On Cliff Road, the Seaside Boarding House’s breezy New England-style weatherboarding is a definite draw.

But Grijalva issued a fiery condemnation of Republicans and their behavior around the halls of Congress.“While I cannot blame anyone directly for this, this week has shown that there are some members of Congress who fail to take this crisis seriously,” he said. “Numerous Republican members routinely strut around the Capitol without a mask to selfishly make a political statement at the expense of their colleagues, staff, and their families.”The attack comes after Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has frequently refused to wear a mask, tested positive for coronavirus last week. In shunning a mask, Gohmert is following the lead of Donald Trump, who is rarely seen wearing one either in the White House or on presidential visits.In a TV interview after the diagnosis, Gohmert even suggested he may have contracted coronavirus by incorrectly wearing his mask.“I can’t help but wonder if by keeping a mask on and keeping it in place, that if I might have put some germs or some of the virus on to the mask and breathed it in,” Gohmert said.After the Gohmert news broke, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced she would require all House members and aides to wear mask. “Members and staff will be required to wear masks at all times in the hall of the House,” Pelosi said.Lawmakers will be permitted to temporarily take off masks when they are speaking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36fca06dcb3e5018a170f07ec106d91cee3cfab0/0_107_4731_2840/master/4731.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b8189dcc039a16d4916f1e49e07a8f67","title":"coronavirus near me are uk covid 19 cases rising in your local area","story":"Latest updates: how has Covid-19 progressed where you live? Check the week-on-week changes across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern IrelandThe map shows local authorities where the number of cases has increased week-on-week and where it has fallen. Some of this is due to natural fluctuations, especially in areas where there are very few cases, and so a rise from 1 to 2 is a doubling. Increased testing also means that more cases may be being detected than previously, although the impact of this between one week and the next is likely to be slight.But even in Kent, a large and populous county with relatively many cases, a rise week-on-week may still be consistent with a downward trajectory overall, if outweighed by falls in the weeks before and after. It does, however, suggest the value of continued vigilance.The chart below shows the areas that have had the highest daily peaks of new Covid-19 cases. Despite a first peak at the start of April, notably in Birmingham and Sheffield, cases in all areas were falling in May.Other areas have had less dramatic peaks of infection. Find the cases curve in your own area by typing into the search bar below.The numbers of cases only include those who have been tested for Covid-19. The actual number of cases is likely to be much higher as many people with symptoms have not been tested. Cases data for England comes from Public Health England and includes only tests carried out by public health bodies. This is known as “pillar 1” testing.At time of publication, approximately a third of positive tests were carried by commercial testers, so-called “pillar 2” testing. While these commercial test results are included in the UK-wide figure, data about these tests is not available at a regional or local level in England. Public health bodies for other UK nations follow different approaches so comparisons between areas in different parts of the UK may be problematic. Note also that historical data on daily cases is published by National Health Scotland by NHS health board, not by local authority.The numbers for deaths are not as up to date as the numbers for cases.

Age UK has said it no longer makes sense to end the advice for vulnerable people to stay at home, since rising infection rates led to additional lockdown restrictions in parts of northern England and the pausing of further easing in the rest of the country.As of Saturday, more than 2 million people who are extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus are no longer being advised by governments in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to stay at home, or shield. Many people have expressed concern that they feel forced to return to the workplace even though they do not think it is safe and the virus is still circulating in communities.Caroline Abrahams, director at Age UK, said: “With a number of lockdown easements firmly on hold and millions under new restrictions in the north it seems perverse for shielding, and the supports it brings, to be paused as of today.“There might have been a rationale for this pause when it was originally announced, a couple of weeks ago, but surely not now. Many shielding older workers, for example, are likely to be feeling distinctly nervous if they are required by their employer to return to their workplace on Monday.”She added: “As the government is toughening up precautions to arrest the spread of the virus it seems only fair that they also continue to recognise and meet the support needs of those at greatest clinical risk.”Those with serious illness such as blood cancers and severe asthma, as well as those on immunosuppressant medication, were ordered to shield from 23 March, initially for a period of 12 weeks.Shielding advice remains in place in Blackburn with Darwen, parts of Leicester and Luton. In Wales, shielding is expected to end on 16 August.Leading scientists were among those to express concern this week that shielding might be ending too soon. The Trades Union Congress is asking employers not to force the return of their staff and instead to continue using the government’s job retention scheme for shielding workers, which runs until October. It is also calling for this to be extended for people who are told by their doctor that they should shield for longer.Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was critical that the safety net put in place for those shielding did not simply “disappear” as it was a lifeline for clinically vulnerable people.The Health and Safety Executive has said every effort should be made to help shielding workers do their jobs from home, but many teachers, shop workers, library staff and warehouse workers cannot do their jobs remotely.The government has said employers must ensure the safety of anyone with a long-term condition or a rare disease when considering working arrangements, “including whether work can be completed remotely and that workplaces are Covid-secure”. If clinically extremely vulnerable people cannot work from home, the government is advising that they be offered the safest available on-site job. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our shielding guidance is based on the latest clinical advice.“As average incidence rates across the country remain sufficiently low, we do not want to advise anyone to follow these measures for longer than is necessary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a7226ea6b6b827a30b07c0840601fc165486981/0_49_962_577/master/962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ade7141f5164bb3afa74e4211d4c88e","title":"pubs england close control coronavirus adviser graham medley","story":"The government may have to consider closing pubs in England to control the transmission of the coronavirus and to enable schools to reopen after the summer holidays, one of its top scientific advisers has said.Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) sub-group on pandemic modelling, said reopening schools was a priority for the wellbeing of children and that some other activities might have to stop to control the infection rate.The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine academic told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we’re in a situation whereby most people think that opening schools is a priority for the health and wellbeing of children and that when we do that we are going to reconnect lots of households.“And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools. It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other and then that’s a matter of prioritising, do we think pubs are more important than schools?”Boris Johnson raised the threat on Friday of a second national lockdown as he paused new freedoms scheduled this weekend amid fears that any further reopening of the economy could trigger a full-blown resurgence of the virus. Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said the UK had “probably reached near the limit of what we can do” if the virus was to be kept under control.Medley said the increased lockdown measures in areas across the north-west of England introduced on Thursday night were “highly unlikely” to be the final regional intervention.He said the rise in coronavirus infections appeared to be among younger people but there was a danger it could “spill” over into other parts of the population.“The age distribution of infections has changed, it has moved down into younger age groups and so it is likely we won’t see that increase in hospital admissions related to infection in the same way we did in March,” he said. “But the big fear is the virus just gets out of control and we end up in a situation where there is so much virus that it inevitably spills out into all sections of the population.”Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that infection rates in England are rising, with about 4,200 new cases of coronavirus a day, compared with an estimated 2,800 a week ago. However, this increase is thought to be far below levels seen during the pandemic’s peak.It has emerged that Sage considered a paper in early July, just before the pubs reopened, warning that the possibility of serious disorder in the coming months could “overwhelm all attempts” to control coronavirus and “catastrophically” undermine recovery plans.“Put simply, a serious deterioration of public order could overwhelm all attempts to control contagion, overwhelm hospitals, the criminal justice system and hinder revival of the economy.”The research, prepared by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) policing and security sub-group, described a “volatile and highly complex situation” in which tensions resulting from the pandemic have become “inextricably bound” with structural inequalities and international events.The authors cited the Black Lives Matter movement and an increasing sense of “racial injustice, inequality and discrimination” felt among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, which have been disproportionately affected by the virus.At the same time, the authors said extreme rightwing groups are mobilising at a scale not seen for a decade, and exploiting fatal stabbing incidents in Reading, London and Glasgow. Any serious public disorder that developed would be likely to require military involvement, they said.Large-scale protests, celebrations and unlicensed music events have been increasing, as public health messaging became less clear, the authors added in the paper titled, Public Disorder and Public Health: Contemporary Threats and Risks.The scapegoating of various communities, and a sense of inequality or grievance due to localised lockdowns, could also stoke flames, they warned.“There is already a view among London’s black community that large gatherings on beaches, or outside Anfield, involving predominantly white and older communities, largely see no police intervention of scale,” the report read.“In contrast, large gatherings in streets or parks with music and dancing with predominantly BAME communities or young people result in police intervention.”On Friday, the prime minister did not distance himself from remarks by a Tory MP claiming the “vast majority” of people breaching coronavirus lockdown rules were from BAME communities, particularly those from Muslim backgrounds. He said only that it was “up to the whole country to get this right”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4636d5f02d452228af23595db2c4194df66dd972/0_7_4300_2579/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37f8f40abef220add77aec160c8064c3","title":"global report curfew in australias second largest city as mexico racks up daily record","story":"Surging ‘mystery cases’ put Melbourne in stage 4 restrictions media banned from Republican convention Mexico deaths are world’s third highestThe Australian state of Victoria has declared a state of disaster and placed Melbourne, the country’s second biggest city, under nighttime curfew as it grapples with hundreds of “mystery cases” of coronavirus.As countries around the world including the US, the UK and Spain reimpose varying degrees of lockdowns, the Victorian premier announced that the state had to impose the highest level of restrictions in order to overcome a stubbornly high number of cases that cannot be traced.Daniel Andrews said that without the tougher, six-week so-called stage 4 lockdown, the state risked having six months of milder stage 3 restrictions that would likely not contain the virus and instead overwhelm the health service. Under the stage 4 lockdown, no one will be allowed to venture further than 5km from their home only person per household per day will be allowed to go shopping only one hour of exercise will be permitted and Melbourne faced a curfew from 8pm to 5am.The state of disaster declaration “means that police and others have additional powers”, Andrews said. “We can suspend various acts of the parliament and make sure that we get the job done and there’s no question about the enforceability and the way in which new rules will operate.”Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, faces a “high alert” as it attempts to contain the coronavirus. Its premier has urged people to wear masks on public transport and while shopping.The media will be barred from the US Republican party national convention where Donald Trump is set to be renominated as presidential candidate later this month, with a spokeswoman citing concerns about meeting coronavirus restrictions.The party conventions are normally huge media events but reporters will not be allowed to attend the gathering in Charlotte, North Carolina later this month when 336 delegates will select Trump to run for a second term in November.Trump has attacked as “wrong” claims by his administration’s top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, that the huge level of Covid-19 cases in the US was due to an insufficiently strong response by federal and state governments.The president repeated his claim that the reason the US has the highest number of cases in the world – more than 4.5 million – was because it had done more testing than any other country.There have now been almost 17.8 million confirmed cases around the world and more than 683,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.Thousands of protesters have gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to call for the resignation of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his handling of the coronavirus and corruption. Demonstrators also descended on Netanyahu’s beach house in the central coast region to vent their anger.It was the largest turnout in weeks of protests that have coalesced around Netanyahu’s alleged bungling of the Covid-19 response and also a weak economy. After moving quickly to contain the virus last spring, many believe Israel reopened its economy too quickly, leading to a surge in cases.Seven health officials from China were due to arrive in Hong Kong on Sunday, the first members of a 60-person team that will carry out widespread testing for Covid-19 in the territory as the global financial hub races to halt a third wave of illness.Teachers unions and scientists in the UK have called on ministers to convince them that it is safe to reopen schools next month as planned when the new academic year is due to begin.A leading government adviser has suggested that pubs should be closed in England in order for communities to more safely reopen schools.Mexico reported yet another new daily high for confirmed cases of 9,556, raising its total cases so far to almost 425,000. The country also posted 784 more confirmed Covid-19 deaths, raising its accumulated total to 47,472, and passing the UK as the third highest tally in the world.The head of Mexico’s efforts to fight the pandemic, assistant health secretary Hugo López-Gatell, has resisted calls to resign.In the Philippines, president Rodrigo Duterte has ordered his coronavirus task force to address the concerns of more than a million doctors and nurses who called for reviving strict lockdowns after a third day of record infections. But the government cast doubt on the request of the frontline healthcare workers to revive strict lockdowns of the populous area in and around the capital Manila, Reuters reported."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab5d972ee26ba5ebc04cbc80eb4adfc6c63e641d/0_1515_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d9a78bf7c21ba176147af0df42081cfb","title":"is this the beginning of the end for europes last dictator","story":"Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus faces threats from all sides as the country decides whether to give him a sixth term as presidentAlexander Lukashenko is under pressure like never before. The past week has brought astonishing scenes in Belarus: an opposition rally hailed as the largest since the fall of the Soviet Union the arrest of 33 Russian mercenaries allegedly sent to destabilise the country and an admission from Lukashenko that after months of minimising the coronavirus epidemic, he had tested positive for the virus.It is likely that the president, who has held power for 25 years, will claim victory in the 9 August elections and remain the country’s leader. But he is on the defensive, facing an energised opposition amid bitter spats with Russia over economic integration, and with the west over human rights. It is the most precarious moment of his career.“For the first time, Lukashenko is fighting a war on three fronts,” said Alexander Feduta, a political analyst who served as an aide to Lukashenko in the 1990s. “He doesn’t know where to turn.” Even with a win in next Sunday’s vote, those battles will follow Lukashenko into his sixth term.Backed into a corner, the Belarusian leader has responded this week by visiting military bases and anti-riot troops, telling them that they “must not allow” street protests. State television has broadcast footage of water cannon and troops holding mock clashes with demonstrators.The message to the opposition was clear: think twice about challenging the election result. But the normal scare tactics have done little to dampen turnout at opposition rallies, which have attracted crowds in the thousands, even in smaller towns that usually deliver strong turnout for the incumbent president.“It’s all to scare Belarusians so that they don’t protest. But it’s not working,” said Feduta. “The more that he tries to scare them, the more it has a reverse effect… Right now, he is trying to convince everyone that he will open fire. If there’s no shooting, it’s him being weak. But if a shot is fired, it’s his political death.”Protests to challenge the results next week look inevitable. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the united opposition candidate, has told journalists that she won’t call for demonstrations but will join them if they break out. She agreed to run as a stand-in for her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, a popular YouTuber jailed by the authorities. Her campaign platform is simple: release political prisoners and arrange a new round of free and fair elections.Viktor Babariko, a jailed opposition candidate who is now barred from standing, said in an interview before his arrest that while he hoped people would eschew violence, the public was angry. “We saw how a deceived people dealt with Ceaușescu,” he said, referencing the swift demise of the Romanian dictator in the final few days of 1989.Opposition rallies are growing to unprecedented numbers. A rally in Minsk on 19 July attracted around 10,000 people. A rally in the same city 11 days later had an estimated attendance of 63,000 people, according to monitors from the human rights organisation Viasna, making it the largest demonstration since the fall of the Soviet Union.“You think that I’m not afraid? I’m afraid every day,” Tikhanovskaya told the crowd. “But I get up, summon my will, get over my fear and move forward.”In the absence of trustworthy polling, much of the evidence relies on crowd numbers and anecdotal evidence. Opposition leaders say that Lukashenko has lost a lot of support for his blasé remarks on the coronavirus pandemic and for simple exhaustion with his leadership.“There’s become a kind of personal dislike for him,” said Maria Kolesnikova, the head of Babariko’s aborted campaign, which has united behind Tikhanovskaya. “He was seen for a long time as the strong leader. And now he’s 65, and there’s a sense that it’s time for him to retire.”While Lukashenko could once often turn to Russia, a traditional ally, for backing, relations between the two countries have soured.The dispute centres on a Russian-led plan to further integrate the two countries’ economies. Lukashenko has accused his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, of putting economic pressure on him and later backing his opponents in the elections.In a sharp escalation of tensions this week, Belarus accused 33 Russian mercenaries who were detained near Minsk of preparing a terrorist attack to destabilise the country ahead of the election.Moscow has demanded the return of the men and toughened border checks between the two countries.Analysts said that Lukashenko is likely to release the men after the election, but for now will want to hold them to emphasise to the public the danger of an intervention from Moscow.“Lukashenko must show that if there are protests against his elections, then they’re being inspired by Russia,” said Feduta."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15167940d871cb35b6c34cf22188d282b62c1b1b/0_255_4242_2545/master/4242.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ad9b98e1ed08813b6787528a3074bf45","title":"coronavirus live news victoria faces highest lockdown as south africa cases pass 500000","story":"Hundreds of ‘mystery cases’ have forced decision in Australian state UK planning to avoid a second national lockdown South Africa’s cases pass 500,000There’s been some distancing by a senior government minister in the UK from reports that millions of over-fifties could face tighter restrictions than others under plans to avoid a second national lockdown.The Communities Minister, Robert Jenrick, was asked about the suggestions on Times Radio, tweets the Mail’s deputy political editor.The World Health Organization has warned that the coronavirus pandemic would be lengthy and could lead to “response fatigue”, as the case count in South Africa topped half a million.Six months after the WHO declared a global emergency, the novel coronavirus has killed more than 680,000 people and infected more than 17.5 million, according to a tally by the AFP news agency.South Africa is by far the hardest hit country in Africa, accounting for more than half of diagnosed infections, although President Cyril Ramaphosa said the fatality rate is lower than the global average.Health authorities had been expecting a surge in cases after the gradual loosening of a strict lockdown that was imposed at the end of March.Nigeria on Saturday also announced it would ease a lockdown in the commercial capital Lagos, allowing churches and mosques to reopen next week.An emergency WHO committee reviewing the pandemic “highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 outbreak, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts”.“WHO continues to assess the global risk level of Covid-19 to be very high,” it said in its latest statement.The agency also said the effects of the pandemic “will be felt for decades to come”.Coronavirus infections in the Philippines surged past 100,000 Sunday in a troubling milestone after medical groups declared that the country was waging a losing battle against the virus and asked the president to reimpose a lockdown in the capital.The Department of Health reported a record-high daily tally of 5,032, bringing the total confirmed cases in the country to 103,185, including more than 2,000 deaths, the Associated Press news agency reports.The Philippines has the second highest number of cases in south-east Asia after Indonesia, and has had more infections than China, where the pandemic began late last year.President Rodrigo Duterte eased a tough virus lockdown in the capital, Manila a city of more than 12 million people on 1 June after the economy shrank slightly in the first quarter, its first contraction in more than two decades. After shopping malls and workplaces were partially reopened and limited public transport was allowed, infections spiked sharply with increased virus testing.After Duterte further relaxed quarantine restrictions and allowed more businesses, including gyms, internet cafes and tattoo shops, to reopen, leaders of nearly 100 medical organizations held an online news conference Saturday and warned that the health system may collapse as many medical personnel fall ill or resign out of fear, fatigue or poor working conditions.“We are waging a losing battle against Covid-19 and we need to draw up a consolidated, definitive plan of action,” said the groups, which represent more than a million nurses, doctors and other medical personnel.In the UK, where police have broken up several large dance parties since the lockdown began earlier this year, a warning has been issued to people to stay away from an area in south-west England, where they have been forced to break up a rave attended by a “large volume” of partygoers.Gloucestershire police sent out this tweet this morning:Police told PA Media news agency that they responded to reports of a “large volume” of people in the area. No arrests have yet been made.Officers clashed with partygoers at an illegal event in north London last month while music from a similar event attended by 3,000 people in Bath last month could be heard five miles away.Financial penalties which would otherwise be in place in the case of jobseekers in the Australian state of Victoria have been suspended for now as authorities seek to mitigate the social impact of the lockdown there.After the the announcement of tough new restrictions for metropolitan Melbourne, including an overnight curfew, we’ve launched a piece explaining some of the rulesThe stage 4 restrictions covering metropolitan Melbourne run from Sunday 2 August and will last for six weeks until Sunday 13 September.You are only allowed to leave your house for four reasons: shopping for food and essential items, care and caregiving, daily exercise and work. Employers must support you to work from home if you can work from home.Unlike stage 3, there is now a curfew on Melbourne residents between 8pm and 5am.Australia’s Capital Territory, which is home to Canberra, is currently “Covid-free” but the risk of the virus returning to the territory is “edging higher” with daily increases in the number of active cases across New South Wales (NSW), according to authorities there.The NSW premier and chief health officer say the state’s government is encouraging people to wear a mask in enclosed spaces where physical distancing is not possible.This includes work in customer-facing roles in hospitality or retail, public transport and places of worship. Face masks are also recommended to be word by those in areas of high community transmission.Tokyo confirmed 292 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, after the number of cases rose by more than 400 in the past two days, according to Japan’s public broadcaster.Governor Koike Yuriko had said Tokyo could declare a state of emergency if the coronavirus situation in the Japanese capital deteriorates further, as debate deepened over how to respond to record increases in new infections.Russia reported 5,427 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, bringing its nationwide tally to 850,870, the fourth largest caseload in the world.Russia’s coronavirus taskforce said 70 people had died over the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll in the country of about 145 million people to 14,128.Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, had said that recent improvement in his country could quickly be reversed.“The number of coronavirus infections in Russia gradually decreased in June and July,” Putin said during a video conference with officials on Wednesday last week, adding that the number of new cases had halved since the peak in May.The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has ordered officials to work up a plan for avoiding a second national lockdown, according to a Sunday newspaper report this morning.The Sunday  – formerly the home of Johnson columns – reports that elderly people and others considered to be at increased risk from Covid-19 could be asked to stay at home under radical plans being drawn up to avert a second national lockdown.It adds that the prime minister has asked officials to prepare a range of measures that could help avoid shutting down the economy for a second time.There’s talk of “enhanced” or “differential” shielding, while one proposal is for shielded people to be allocated specific times of the week to have exclusive access to some services and shops. In England, government plans to reopen all schools in September have been called into question by leading scientists and the head of a major teaching union amid signs that cases of Covid-19 are increasing again at an alarming rate.Despite imposing new restrictions on people meeting indoors in parts of the north of England on Thursday – and postponing plans to allow bowling alleys, casinos, skating rinks and other venues to reopen a day later – ministers insist that reopening schools fully early next month remains a top priority.But in a sign of growing concern and uncertainty about the strategy, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, which represents more than 300,000 teachers across the UK, said the government needed to take urgent action to convince parents and teachers that schools would be safe.The clock is ticking down to the start of a six-week overnight curfew in the Australian city of Melbourne, where residents will be banned from travelling more than 5km to go shopping or exercise as the state of Victoria struggles to get the number of new cases of coronavirus under control.Its premier, Daniel Andrews, announced that from 6pm on Sunday, people in the Melbourne metropolitan area would be under curfew for six weeks until 13 September.Andrews also declared a state of disaster in Victoria for the first time since the bushfires earlier this year.Under the new restrictions, residents would only be able to leave their home once a day for essential supplies and food, and once for one hour’s exercise, within a 5km radius.Good morning from London, meanwhile, from where this is Ben Quinn picking up the live blog from Helen.That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today.

They must follow higher safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of healthy people.In the pre-clinical stage of testing, researchers give the vaccine to animals to see if it triggers an immune response. In phase 1 of clinical testing, the vaccine is given to a small group of people to determine whether it is safe and to learn more about the immune response it provokes. In phase 2, the vaccine is given to hundreds of people so scientists can learn more about its safety and correct dosage. In phase 3, the vaccine is given to thousands of people to confirm its safety – including rare side effects – and effectiveness. These trials involve a control group which is given a placebo.

Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Infections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph: EPAHAYOUNG JEONChina’s ByteDance has reportedly agreed to est the US operations of TikTok completely in a bid to save a deal with the White House.The move comes after President Donald Trump said on Friday he had decided to ban the popular short-video app, two people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.Under the new proposed deal, ByteDance would exit completely and Microsoft would take over TikTok in the United States, the sources said.US officials have said TikTok under its Chinese parent poses a national risk because of the personal data it handles. ByteDance’s concession will test whether Mr Trump’s threat to ban TikTok is a negotiating tactic, or whether he is intent on cracking down on a social media app that boasts it has 100 million users in the United States.Mr Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One late on Friday that he would issue an order for TikTok to be banned in the United States as early as Saturday. “Not the deal that you have been hearing about, that they are going to buy and sell . . . We are not an M\u0026ampA (mergers and acquisitions) country,” Trump said.Late on Saturday, Peter Navarro, director of the White House’s office of trade and manufacturing policy, told Fox News that Mr Trump would be taking action on TikTok on Sunday or Monday.ByteDance was previously seeking to keep a minority stake in the US business of TikTok, which the White House had rejected. “The administration has very serious national security concerns over TikTok. We continue to evaluate future policy,” the White House said in a statement, declining to comment on whether Mr Trump would accept ByteDance’s concession. ByteDance in Beijing did not respond to a request for comment.“We are here for the long run. Continue to share your voice here and let’s stand for TikTok,” TikTok U.S. general manager Vanessa Pappas said in a video published on the app on Saturday.Under ByteDance’s new proposal, Microsoft, which also owns professional social media network LinkedIn, will be in charge of protecting all of TikTok’s US user data, the sources said. The plan allows for a US company other than Microsoft to take over TikTok in the United States, the sources added. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318845.1596206285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk outlines brexit talks timetable running into october","story":"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue discussing a free trade deal until October 2nd, British chief negotiator David Frost said on Friday.“Negotiating rounds will take place in August and in September, unless agreed otherwise between the parties,” according to a document Mr Frost posted on Twitter.A fifth round of Brexit talks between ended last week with both sides saying they were still far from reaching an agreement.

Photograph: Doug MillsThe New York Times The vote to renominate Donald Trump for US president at the Republican Convention is to be held in private later this month without members of the press present.Although Mr Trump called off the public components of the convention in Florida last month, citing rising cases of coronavirus across the country, 336 delegates were scheduled to gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, on August 24th to formally vote to make him the Republican Party’s standard-bearer once more.Nominating conventions are traditionally meant to be media bonanzas, as political parties seek to leverage the attention the events draw to spread their message to as many voters as possible.If the party’s decision stands, it will mark the first nominating convention in modern history to be closed to reporters.“Given the health restrictions and limitations in place within the state of North Carolina, we are planning for the Charlotte activities to be closed press,” a convention spokeswoman said.“We are happy to let you know if this changes, but we are working within the parameters set before us by state and local guidelines regarding the number of people who can attend events.”Privately, some delegations have raised logistical issues, citing the increasing number of jurisdictions imposing mandatory quarantine orders on travellers returning from states experiencing surges in the virus.The subset of delegates in Charlotte will be casting proxy votes on behalf of the more than 2,500 official delegates to the convention.Alternate delegates and guests have already been prohibited. – PARead more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"black staff offered counselling curating difficult slavery museum","story":"The UK’s pre-eminent Slavery Museum will offer mental health support and safe spaces for black curators handling racist historical material.Staff working with potentially upsetting relics of the transatlantic slave trade and British colonialism will have help dealing with “difficult content”.National Museums Liverpool (NML), which includes Britain’s leading slavery museum, has said this material is inherently racist and support for curators recounting bleak histories is “essential” after Black Lives Matter protests in the UK.There is particular concern for the welfare of black employees who may feel “expectation” to effectively tackle the subject of slavery following increased interest in the trade and profiteers like Edward Colston.The International Slavery Museum, which recently offered to display the toppled statues of slave traders, houses artefacts including shackles used to chain African captives, and hooded robes worn by the Ku Klux Klan.Museum bosses hope spaces safely free from difficult material, along with new formal processes to raise mental health concerns and receive support, will ease the strain on staff delving into historical racism.Janet Dugdale, head of curatorial teams at the NML, told the Sunday :  “When you think about a museum collecting material that is racist in its intent, to be able to show that, to be able to understand that, that’s hard.“It can have quite an impact on staff and colleagues that are working in that field.  It’s not easy work. “I think it’s draining.  People care, and if you care that can have an impact on your mental health.”Ms Dugdale has revealed that across the museums in Liverpool new processes for staff to raise mental health concerns and receive support from the organisations will be put in place.The curatorial expert said that many historical and contemporary subjects are difficult for staff to be continually immersed, but slavery and its inescapably racist remnants were an upsetting area of study.Black Lives Matter protests which lead to the toppling of slave traders’ statues have only increased the pressure on historically conscious black employees, Ms Dugdale said.She told the Sunday :  “For a lot of black colleagues, over the last few weeks, and I don’t want to put words into anyone’s mouths, but it is hard.“If you are black and you are working on subject matter like this.  There’s a lot of expectation about how we’re responding.”Black staff burned out by the strain of grappling with grim elements of history will be among those promised “safe places” to get a break from the slave trade and other areas of curation.There will be increased one-on-one help for employees, which Ms Dugdale hopes will be adopted by other museums across the country.It has also been suggested that exhibitions focused on activism could be a “positive” alternative to a gruelling schedule of shows on painful historical subjects.She said the Slavery museum and others in Liverpool are focused on  “Safeguarding and looking after colleagues who deal with all sorts of difficult subjects. We have been thinking carefully about how we support people.”The International Slavery Museum offered to house toppled statues of profiteers from the trade as part of an ethical overhaul when Black Lives Matter protests resulted in monuments to Edward Colston and Robert Milligan being taken down in June.The museum focuses not only on the transatlantic slave trade, with artefacts from the era of African kidnap and servitude, but on modern day slavery and the legacy of racism.Ms Dugdale said that even these exhibitions were not free from the need to decolonise and update galleries, and NML would continue modernising its collections. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"deserted beaches free covid tests no masks europes safest","story":"Norway has more coastline than Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Sweden and France combined and ten times as many islands as Greece, the country\u0027s tourism agency is boasting in its new advertising campaign for British holidaymakers forced to rethink travel plans in light of Europe\u0027s \u0027second wave\u0027.Space to social distance rather than sunshine is at the core of the new marketing campaigns launched by a string of unusual holiday destinations competing to lure Brits taking last-minute summer breaks.  With just three cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight, and a population density of less than six people per square mile, Norway has a good claim to being both the safest destination, and the most unlikely to see Britain impose surprise quarantine rules.It is 2nd only to Estonia in the number of Co-19 cases.Estonia has registered even fewer infections, 2.6 per 100,000, making it is the safest destination in Europe currently completely open to British tourists. Finland and Hungary, on 2.6 and 2.4 respectively, still impose restrictions.There is a caveat, however: it\u0027s worth remembering that if the UK\u0027s 14-day cumulative rate of new infections rises from today\u0027s 12.6 per 100,000 to 16, visitors to Estonia will face quarantine, and if it hits 20, visitors to Norway will.Like Norway\u0027s, Estonia\u0027s tourism agency is pushing the appeal of its deserted countryside, 2,000 islands, and its low infection rate.  Our most important message to you is that yes, it is safe to be in Estonia, says Kristin Liisma, Foreign Media Coordinator for Estonia’s Tourism Board. Some Estonian regions are home to just 6.5 people per square km (2.5 per square mile) and it’s easy to find peace and quiet in untouched nature, which is a scarce commodity in other parts of the world.Almost all of the country\u0027s cases have been either on the island of Saaremaa, where an outbreak was linked to a visiting Italian volleyball team, and in the region around the capital, Tallinn. Eleven out of its 15 regions have not registered a single new case in the last fortnight. Saaremaa, a tourist destination known for its forests, castles and nine meteor craters, has not recorded one since May.Tallinn has the best-preserved medieval city centre in northern Europe, but for those uncomfortable with spending time in cities, Kristin Liisma recommends the country\u0027s erse hiking trails leading through picturesque bogs.The country\u0027s beaches, she adds, are also largely empty (due perhaps to average August temperatures below 16C). Unlike a usual busy resort, the sandy beaches of Estonia have enough space to enjoy the privacy at the beach.Bente Bratland Holm, chief executive of Visit Norway, adds: I think the most spectacular beaches we have are outside Stavanger, both for swimming and surfing.There is one drawback, however: Stavanger did not have a single official \u0027summer day\u0027 last month, with temperatures sticking stubbornly below the 20C benchmark in what has been the coldest July for a quarter of a century.Even Sweden, highly scrutinised for its liberal coronavirus restrictions, one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, is now promoting its low population density, with less than ten people per square mile, as a draw.  Our big advantage is that we are a country with a lot of space. 97 percent of the country is uninhabited, Ewa Lagerqvist, chief executive of Visit Sweden, says.  If you would like to avoid crowds during this time of the year, which I believe a lot of people would, I would recommend the destinations where you have most room, which means the northern parts of Sweden.Sweden also lets all tourists from the EU and the UK come, regardless of the infection rate at home.In addition to Visit Norway\u0027s \u0027Welcome to Space\u0027 campaign,  the Norwegian health authorities are now offering free coronavirus tests to all foreign tourists.The health authorities have said that all people visiting us only need to have one symptom that they suspect could be Covid-19 to be entitled to a free test in all municipalities in Norway, Bratland Holm says.Another draw of holidaying in countries with low population densities is the absence of tough restrictions. Neither Norway, Sweden, nor Estonia recommends people to wear masks, and while concerts and festivals involving big crowds are still not permitted, most leisure activities are open.In Norway and Denmark, even theme parks are back up and running, with the Danish government subsidising ticket prices, so that families visiting Legoland, for instance, can get a 37 percent discount.Lagerqvist argues that even Stockholm, the centre of Sweden\u0027s pandemic, with 2,440 deaths per million inhabitants, is now safe as the city\u0027s residents are mostly out at summer cottages until schools reopen in mid-August.Right now the big cities are quite empty, as most of the Swedish population are on vacation themselves, so probably the cities are very enjoyable as well, she says.  Sweden\u0027s tourism industry trade body has launched a Safe to Visit scheme, where restaurants, hotels and campsites which meet the country\u0027s coronavirus precautions can advertise this fact with stickers on their windows.And the weather is not all bad. The north of Norway was this week basking in temperatures of 25C.The weather is beautiful at the moment, says Bratland Holm, who is currently herself holidaying herself on the north-west coast. The kids are playing in the water. It’s not quite up to 25 degrees, but it\u0027s manageable.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"empty sun loungers cast long shadow empty greek beaches","story":"It’s early evening in Mykonos town and the sunset selfie-seekers are out in full force.

Following the outbreak of the pandemic, Greece closed its ports to all cruise ships as part of its nationwide lockdown.The country plans to open six of its cruise ports from August 1st, but the island’s mayor, Konstantinos Koukas fears it is too late in the season for cruises to make any real difference to ailing businesses. “Even if they do start again, we don’t know if they will have visitors on board,” he says.Rampias says businesses that own their properties will likely weather the storm, but those with leases may struggle to open next year, due to the island’s high rents. “It depends on how much people have put aside in the last few years,” she adds.And many will have struggled to save after almost a decade of austerity following Greece’s 2009 sovereign debt crisis, which saw GDP contract 9.1 per cent in 2011. The recession crippled the country, leading to mass unemployment, pension and wage cuts, and heavy privatisation.Greece’s economy has recovered thanks in part to tourism revenue the sector makes up 18 per cent of the country’s GDP and employs one in five Greeks. But the success story is now looking like unhealthy overreliance as the pandemic has ground the world’s travellers to a halt. In May, the European Commission forecast Greek GDP would contract by 9.75 per cent, deeper than the last recession, but has since revised its forecast to a milder 9 per cent.Businesses who weathered the last crisis are bracing for another blow. For the first time, five-star resorts built into bays and hills across the island stand eerily empty. The Myconian Collection is Mykonos’ largest luxury accommodation chain. Its ten, family-owned properties are all closed this year. The Myconian did not reply to The ’s queries on its decision.Smaller hotels are faring better, but prices have dropped significantly, and average capacity across the island is at roughly 25 per cent, according to Mayor Koukas. Markos and Jessica run White and Grey, a small hotel a few kilometres outside town. They felt obliged to drop their room prices by almost 50 per cent because of similar cuts offered by their competitors.Through April and May the couple contemplated remaining shut themselves. “But finally we had to balance out our renovation costs,” says Jessica. “It was like playing poker.” While occupancy remains low – three out of ten rooms are booked – they are holding out hope for August.Mayor Koukas has had a busy week. On Tuesday, Greece’s minister for citizen’s protection came to Mykonos to step up enforcement of regulations at the island’s more unruly establishments. 110 police officers have been provided to support 24-hour inspection efforts.In June, a video of a crowded dance party at Alemagou beach bar went viral. Local authorities imposed a 60-day closure, and €20,000 fine for the flouting of safety regulations. The bar reopened 15 days later, according to local reports. “They should do better, and we’re after them,” said Koukas of the beach bars.  Although visits were at an all time low in June and July, arrival rates to the island’s airport are picking up rapidly, coinciding with an uptick in cases across Greece. While the country’s decisive handling of the virus meant it has recorded only 203 deaths to date, daily cases are the highest they’ve ever been. 65 new cases were reported in the latest 24-hour period, 34 of which came from international arrivals.On Thursday night at Scorpios, an exclusive beach club frequented by models and influencers, groups of party-goers are settling in for the sunset. Masked wait staff deliver €300 wine bottles to low tables with stunning views across a bay. A hundred or so more people are queuing outside, desperate for a seat. “We’re not worried because it’s all open air,” says Diago, a young man who flew from the UK with a stop off in Italy. “It’s no different to the parks in London.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"even poor people can have full fruit bowl","story":"Every now and then my mum will come out with a gem. One of her favourites is: “We were poor but we always had a full fruit bowl.” I thought of her this week as feathers were ruffled in the wake of Boris Johnson’s Covid obesity crackdown. My own hackles rose when one writer blamed coming from a poor family for being overweight as a child, as if the only option for those on low incomes is to mainline McDonald’s meal deals.How perfectly patronising. I, too, was brought up, for want of a better word “poor” with my brother and sister, raised on a Merseyside council estate by a single mother who worked in a factory. We didn’t do holidays, we didn’t do new clothes, but we did do healthy meals. My mum would drag me round the local fruit and veg market every Saturday, for the exact number of apples, carrots and spuds needed for a week’s worth of meals. She watched her pennies like a hawk and cooked up stews, pastas and shepherd’s pie in rotation (Thursday was Top Cat and spag bol). For “afters” it was whatever was in the fruit bowl. It kept us healthy and her budgeting frankly kept us out of the gutter.A lot has changed since my Seventies childhood, when going to the chippy was a payday treat. We didn’t have fast-food chains or ready meals. Somewhere between then and now, the passing on of nutritious, low-cost recipes from parent to child has got lost in a sea of processed BOGOF deals that are literally cheaper than chips.Britain is today the fattest nation in Western Europe and the sixth fattest in the world. But being obese isn’t an inevitability for people on the breadline. Hand-wringers need to wake up to the fact that obesity, coronavirus and those who earn less are clamped together in a deathly dance. And unless you’re loading saffron and truffle oil into your basket or you have no actual home to live in, it is absolutely untrue that you can’t eat well on a tiny budget, as chefs like Jamie Oliver and food writer Jack Monroe have thanklessly proven.My sister, a chef and herself a low earner, gives cookery classes to people on low incomes (sadly funded by sporadic lottery cash rather than central government, which is too busy handing out eat-out vouchers to people who don’t need them). Those who attend say the same thing – they want to cook, but they’ve never been taught and ingredients are too expensive. My sister will whip up fishcakes from tinned salmon, chilli with 50p cans of kidney beans, and everyone’s favourite chicken curry.She’ll discuss healthy portion sizes, the ease of batch cooking, and at the end announce to a chorus of “blimeys” that each meal she makes costs less than £1. Tasty, filling, and dead simple. After every six-week course her group leaves feeling confident and empowered. Many have told her they no longer feel the need to spend £9 on a takeaway curry or a ridiculous fortune on a Domino’s pizza(or two for just £23.98), because her handful of dishes is seeing them through.This misguided perception that healthy eating is solely for the turmeric latte classes should be taken off the menu right now. It is filtering down to the very demographic many of these chatterers are trying to help. And with a second Covid fatburger looming into view, that will have dire consequences for the beleaguered NHS and those with little money. Full fruit bowls on a low income? It’s the future.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden buries hatchet looks bring kamala harris running mate","story":"On Friday night, supporters of Joe Biden received an urgent message from his campaign email address. But it wasn’t from the Democrat presidential nominee. It was from Kamala Harris.Underneath a picture of herself, the California senator wrote: “I know Joe’s heart, and I’ve seen first-hand his compassion and dedication to public service. He’ll be a president for all of us, and I’m giving everything I’ve got to help him succeed this year.”It was a further signal, if one were needed, that Ms Harris, 55, is now a clear favourite to become Mr Biden’s running mate. He has said he will make a decision next week. But the message was also clearly intended to defuse a vicious behind-the-scenes battle that has reached fever pitch in recent days.With so much on the line, the knives have been out for Ms Harris within the Democratic party. Anonymous briefings, some emanating from people in 77-year-old Mr Biden’s own camp, have attempted to portray her as disloyal, ruthlessly ambitious, opportunistic, untrustworthy and intent on becoming president herself.Read more: Who will be Joe Biden\u0027s running mate? The runners and ridersSimultaneously, some Democrats have been furiously talking up the chances of other candidates including Susan Rice, Barack Obama’s former national security adviser, congresswoman Karen Bass, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, and senator Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran. Much of the internal doubt over Ms Harris goes back to the verbal attacks on Mr Biden she gave when campaigning for the presidential nomination.During a televised Democrat debate a year ago, and despite having been close to his late son Beau, Ms Harris unleashed on Mr Biden.She accused him of having opposed “busing”, a policy from the Seventies that was used to desegregate education by transporting black children to mostly white schools.Ms Harris said she, as a young black girl, had benefited from the policy, but Mr Biden had joined with segregationist senators in an attempt to stop it.Mr Biden was visibly stunned. “I thought we were friends...” he said later. Observers wondered whether the pair would ever speak again. Nevertheless, Ms Harris has been in pole position to be Mr Biden’s running mate for some time.When a photographer caught sight of Mr Biden’s handwritten speaking notes (below) at an event this week, the top entry was “Kamala Harris – do not hold grudges”.Ms Harris would be the first black woman to become a vice-presidential nominee. She is the daughter of academics who immigrated to America. Her Jamaican-born father is a Stanford University economist, and her mother was a Tamil cancer research scientist.After studying at the predominantly black Howard University, in Washington, she became a prosecutor, rising to be the first female, and first black, attorney general of California.Ironically, her decades as a prosecutor may appeal to Republican voters she has been accused by some Democrats of “keeping innocent people on death row”, despite her personal opposition to capital punishment.She also once threatened to prosecute parents if their children did not go to school.Ms Harris has been a rising star in the Democrat firmament for some time. In 2013, Barack Obama said of her: “She is brilliant and she is dedicated, and she is tough. She also happens to be, by far, the best looking attorney general in the country.”The comment ignited a brief political firestorm in which the president was widely accused of sexism. Mr Obama called his friend to apologise. As a senator sitting on the senate committee investigating Russian election interference, she criticised Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump’s attorney general, live on television, and then targeted Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee.Mr Trump called her “nasty”. Democrats called her the “female Obama”.Ms Harris then entered the Democrat presidential race to great fanfare, on Martin Luther King Jr day, in January. However, her campaign failed to catch fire. After the initial ambush on Mr Biden, several debate performances fell flat, money dried up and poll numbers plummeted.Ideologically, Ms Harris did not appeal to the more Left-wing activist base of the party that supported Bernie Sanders. Her centrist background – and scandal-free personal life, means she is the candidate Republicans may fear most. Ms Rice and Mr Biden worked closely together in the Obama administration. And Ms Bass is seen as a consensus candidate, who would not overshadow Mr Biden.He will speak to each candidate inidually next week. Whoever he picks will have their key campaign moment in the vice-presidential debate.On Friday, Ms Harris rounded on those criticising her. Speaking at a virtual conference for young black women, Ms Harris said her entire career she had been told to “wait her turn”, but she “eats ‘no’ for breakfast”.Urging listeners to embrace their “black girl magic”, she said: “There will be a resistance to your ambition. There will be people who say to you ‘You are out of your lane’.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meghans friends reluctant give evidence support","story":"The Duchess of Sussex may not receive the vital support of her friends as witnesses in her court battle over claims that her privacy was breached, it has emerged.Lawyers for Meghan have said it would be “an unacceptably high price” for the Duchess to be forced to identify the friends in pursuit of her legal claim against the Mail on Sunday (MoS) and that it would be a “cruel irony” should she be required to pay it.She is arguing that naming them would breach their privacy under the European Convention on Human Rights, while the newspaper argues that they must be disclosed as a key principle of open justice.But it is claimed that the prospect of being named in court - as normal procedure would require - has left them reluctant to take the witness stand voluntarily on Meghan\u0027s behalf.Documents submitted to the court by the Duchess’s legal team state: “It is not certain that the friends will be witnesses at the trial of this claim and the Court cannot be required to second-guess the result of any application for anonymity.”Describing the friends as innocent third parties, the Duchess’s lawyers go on to state that they “are not parties to this action but unwilling participants.”“On her case, which will be tried in due course, the Defendant has been guilty of a flagrant and unjustified intrusion into her private and family life. Given the close factual nexus between the Letter and the events leading up to the Defendant’s decision to publish its contents, it would be a cruel irony were she required to pay that price before her claim has even been determined.”The Duchess has applied for an order on behalf of the five that their names remain confidential, as part of her battle with the paper and it’s publishers, Associated Newspapers, but there is no certainty this will be granted by the trial judge, Mr Justice Warby.The five – who can be identified only by the initials A to E, but are all described as “young mothers”– gave briefings to People magazine, a US publication, last February.At the time Meghan was heavily pregnant, vulnerable and being subjected to what she claims was bullying by parts of the media.People revealed the existence of a letter to her father which was subsequently published in MoS, prompting the ongoing High Court action for breach of privacy and copyright.Justin Rushbrooke QC, barrister for the Duchess, told the High Court that she had been forced to identify her friends in a legal request by Associated Newspapers and added that the five were entitled to a very high level of super-charged right of confidentiality.Antony White QC, representing Associated Newspapers, told the court: The five iniduals have already been identified, not under compulsion but as part of the response to the request for further information. The question is not should their identities be disclosed – that has happened – it is should they be anonymised in these proceedings?In an embarrassing moment during the application Mr Rushbrooke accidentally let slip the surname of one of the five.Mr Justice Warby, who is expected to rule on the matter in August, immediately directed that the inidual\u0027s name was not to be reported.It was disclosed earlier that the Duchess had agreed to pay in full £67,888 in costs  to Associated Newspapers after the publisher successfully argued that elements of her case be struck out - a fraction of a multi-million legal bill which is expected should the case go to a full trial next year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cornwall beach locals pandemic masks benidorm steroids","story":"Watergate Bay in Cornwall was looking lively Coronavirus latest:  Shielded groups may get exclusive access to shops under new plans The safest destinations for a last-minute summer holidaySign up to  Travel\u0027s newsletterLocals in Cornwall have expressed concern at the crowds and lack of social distancing in the busiest regions of its coast.Thousands of staycationers descended on Britain\u0027s honeypot resorts this weekend amid the heatwave, with Cornish residents being particularly vocal about the hoards. One described the scenes as being like \u0027Benidorm on steroids\u0027 to the BBC yesterday and another protested that her family was \u0027too scared\u0027 to leave the house and go food shopping.Journalist Rebecca Hallett, who is based in the Truro area, tells  Travel: Looking at the main beaches in Cornwall, you wouldn’t know we’re in the middle of a pandemic. There are tightly packed crowds of (mostly maskless) people out on the sand and walking through town, with the crush seeming at least as bad as in previous years.As one of the UK’s poorest regions, Cornwall is desperate for its usual summer tourism income – but with few critical care beds in the county, many of us are terrified of the cost.Our destination expert Gill Charlton, based in St Ives, remarks: It’s as if some visitors are taking a holiday from Covid-19 guidance too, but she is generally less worried.  Yes, the beaches are busy but they’re not swamped, she says. It’s the usual August crowd: large family groups from all walks of life down for their annual holiday. For those who have been cooped up in cities it must be heavenly to relax on the beach under a warm sun and who are we to deny them a week’s respite from lockdown?Scroll down for more news.A young man dressed as death personified has been prowling the Mexican beach town of Puerto Morelos in Quintana Roo, where beaches are closed to visitors but people are going regardless.That\u0026#39s one way to make a pointThe man was attempting to banish groups from congregatingSome only saw the funny sideThe largest airport outside London has accused ministers of “suffocating the aviation sector”, as flight hubs send mayday signals and warn Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” pledge is at risk.Sir Adrian Montague, chairman of Manchester Airport Group, which also owns the package holiday hub Stansted, condemned the quarantine on travellers from Spain as “unnecessary”.He called for a “more proportionate” approach such as the reintroduction of “travel corridors” to the Balearic and Canary Islands. Meanwhile, a testing regime to save millions of Britons’ overseas holidays will not be in place in time, the ex-Aviva chairman warned. Sir Adrian said:If we cut ourselves off from the important low-risk areas, we are going to suffocate the recovery of the aviation sector.

I had spent years on the paparazzi beat, photographing celebrities on the school run, but also doing shifts for a local agency, where I’d cover stories from the area.I wasn’t scared. When you’re a pap you learn to keep out of trouble and blend into the background. I parked my car and could see Reeves, the historic furniture store, burning. The fire was huge and when I got closer, I realised the block of shops behind it was also in flames.All around me was chaos I could feel the heat on my face from the flames and there were people running everywhere. Behind me was an electrical shop and I noticed kids on bikes cycling away with TVs on the back. People were walking over to them, punching them in the face and grabbing the TVs.I walked up to a crowd of people watching the fire. I think I was lucky because I had the camera up to my face and was shooting the scene when I heard someone say, ‘She’s going to jump!’ About 10 doors down from where I was standing, I saw two legs poking out of a flat window above. I focused on the moment. It was probably just seconds between her jumping and landing, but I got around 30 to 50 frames of her silhouetted against the flames.She was about three floors up – higher than it looks in the photo – and her fall was broken by some firefighters waiting to catch her. She then ran off, so I knew she wasn’t injured. I took this as my cue to leave, too. My sports bra had a pocket in it, so I tucked my camera’s memory card in there for safekeeping.The next morning The , Sun, Mirror, Times and  all ran with my picture on the front page, and people were calling to interview me from all over the world. The woman who jumped was a shop worker called Monika Konczyk. I didn’t meet her until a week later, as she was tied up in a deal with a tabloid. She was fine, a bit flummoxed by all the fuss and to be honest, I don’t think she wanted all the publicity.And it changed my career – not in a tangible way, but in a way that I got more respect from other photographers.I gave it all up in 2013, when my daughter Rumer was born. She has special needs, so I’ve been her carer ever since.Dave put the photo in for a Pulitzer, but it came about 50th, which was disappointing.

The artist, who has become more active on Instagram in recent months, shared an image of her crouching beneath a TV while the new film played. “Thank you Queen for always making us all feel so loved through your art,” she wrote in the caption, along with two heart emojis. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe appeared to be wearing a similar outfit to the costume Beyonce and her dancers were wearing for a dance routine. Among the celebrities to comment on the photo was Game of Thrones star Maisie Williams, who asked Adele to “drop the collab”.Adele is a longtime Beyonce fan. At the 2017 Grammys, where she won Album of the Year for 25, the 32-year-old used her speech to insist the award should have gone to Beyonce, for Lemonade. Beyonce’s Black is King has received acclaim from critics. Writing for The Independent, Niellah Arboine commented: “Black Is King feels like Beyoncé at her best. She’s more experimental with her aesthetics, shots, angles, styling and undoubtedly the music. Black Is King seamlessly jumps through genres, including, R\u0026ampB, pop, hip-hop and Afrobeats – the latter a genre she has gracefully been invited into.“Spine-tingling ballads like ‘Spirit’, which Beyoncé sings with a choir, sit with ‘My Power’, oozing with confidence and with a thumping beat and many voices. The execution is a visual feast, each second full of intention. Every shot is a piece of art, from surreal, otherworldly backdrops to the pure opulence of her own home.

It didn\u0027t seem fair!To understand how many habitable planets a solar system might be able to support, researchers create a model that allowed them to simulate planets of different sizes orbiting their stars. It accounted for the way that those planets would interact with each other as they orbited around their star, stretching over a theoretical time of millions of years.They found that a star like our Sun could support as many as six planets, each of them with liquid water and the conditions to be habitable. Other kinds of stars could support a full seven.If there are more than that, the planets would move too close to each other, disturbing their orbits.The research also helped illuminate the reason our planet has a relatively paltry one habitable planet, and the conditions that would change that. Part of our problem appears to be that the planets of our solar system move around in an oval shape – if their path is more regular and circular, they better minimise contact so that they can have more stable orbits.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It is so large – at two-and-half-times the mass of the rest of the solar system\u0027s planet combined – that it hogs the space and disturbs everything around it, the study suggests.It has a big effect on the habitability of our solar system because it\u0027s massive and disturbs other orbits, Kane said.The research could now help identify other solar systems that could be worth exploring for potential life. That could inform research by Nasa telescopes, such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u0027s Habitable Exoplanet Observatory, which is looking through the universe in an attempt to find which worlds could have the right conditions to be a home.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some remain astonishingly bold by today’s standards, while others have had the gleam worn off by the film’s they’ve gone onto inspire.There are those filmmakers who have attempted to make the twist their trademark (see: M Night Shyamalan, whose 1999 release The Sixth Sense turns 20 this week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThen there are those who have impressively shaped a film around its rug-pulling denouement (Christopher Nolan’s magician drama The Prestige was essentially one giant magic trick). Either way, they make for memorable viewing.37 sequels that are even better than the originalIntriguingly, twists are mostly prevalent in horror films, which is what makes it so breathtaking when they show up mid-way through a drama – or, even rarer, a comedy. We’ve compiled what we believe to be 37 of the greatest twists in cinema history.Click through the gallery below to see what has made the cut. Naturally, spoilers abound – and don’t go ruining the surprise for those who haven’t seen any of these films.Created with Sketch.The most shocking film twists of all time Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her.

Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house.

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Boris Johnson held a war game session with chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday to run through possible options for averting another nationwide lockdown that could stall any potential economic recovery, The Sunday Times reports. A greater number of people would be asked to take part in the shielding programme, based on their age or particular risk factors that have been identified since March, according to The Sunday . Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther ideas floated include restricting travel beyond the M25 to stop people travelling in and out of the capital and putting an end to overnight stays at other people\u0027s houses.Victoria declares state of emergency as curfew imposedBoris Johnson urged to resume\u0026nbspdaily briefings for \u0027confused\u0027 publicLondon \u0027could face localised lockdown\u0027 if cases begin to spikeElderly people \u0027could be asked to shield again\u0027 to avoid second waveAustralian state declares state of disaster and night-time curfewAustralia\u0027s second-most populous state of Victoria has today declared a state of disaster and imposed a nightly curfew for the capital Melbourne as part of its harshest movement restrictions to date after a spike in Covid-19 infections.Melbourne, Australia\u0027s second-largest city, which is already under a reimposed six-week stay-home order, has struggled to rein in the disease, with record numbers of\u0026nbspinfections reported last week.Today, Victoria reported 671 infections, one of its highest, and seven coronavirus-related deaths.High numbers of community transmissions and cases of unknown origins have forced the new restrictions, which will be in place for six weeks, officials said.Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told a televised briefing:\u0026nbspThe current rules have avoided thousands and thousands of cases each day, and then thousands of people in hospital and many more tragedies than we have seen. But it is not working fast enough.A curfew from 8pm to 5am\u0026nbspevery day will be implemented from this\u0026nbspevening in Melbourne, barring the nearly five million people in the city from leaving their houses except for work or to receive or give care.The sweeping new restrictions limit the time Melbourne residents may spend on outdoor exercise and essential shopping.All schools will move to remote learning from Wednesday.Supermarkets will remain open, and restaurants, already closed for dining in, will be able to continue with their takeaway and delivery services.ReutersTax rises or budget cuts will have to pay for pandemic spending, says former ministerFormer Tory cabinet minister David Gauke said he thought tax rises or budget cuts would be used to pay for the government\u0027s coronavirus pandemic spending.The ex-chief secretary to the Treasury told Times Radio: We will have to take it on the chin that our debt will go up, that we\u0027re going to have to live with a higher level of debt for a longer period of time.\u0026nbspInterest rates are low, debt servicing costs are low, given the size of our debt.\u0026nbspI think we are still going to be left with increased pressures on spending, a smaller economy because the economy will be scarred to some extent and that is going to mean we\u0027re going to need what we used to call a fiscal consolidation - that\u0027s either spending cuts or tax rises to get the public finances on a sustainable footing.\u0026nbspWe don\u0027t need them now, there is no rush in terms of doing this.\u0026nbspI think the Chancellor probably will need to set out his plans sooner rather than later just to give the markets some confidence and that there is real credibility in our fiscal plans, but I think there is no need to implement it this year or next year, or possibly not even the year after that.PACluster of 13 cases linked to Aberdeen pubA cluster of 13 cases of Covid-19 linked to a pub in Aberdeen is being investigated by public health authorities.NHS Grampian says the cases are associated with The Hawthorn Bar in the city centre.\u0026nbspAll those who tested positive are showing only mild symptoms, though the health board says there may be further cases linked to the cluster.\u0026nbspThe pub had physical distancing measures in place and contact tracing is being carried out in line with the Scottish government\u0027s Test and Protect scheme.\u0026nbspDr Emmanuel Okpo, consultant in public health medicine, said: Our health protection team are speaking to the confirmed cases, establishing who they have been in contact with and providing further advice on isolation and testing as required.\u0026nbspWe are also carrying out wider contact tracing work, as part of the Test and Protect scheme.We cannot rule out the possibility of detecting further cases linked to this cluster.London \u0027could face localised lockdown if cases spike\u0027Boris Johnson is reportedly considering localised lockdown-like conditions for London if there is a spike in coronavirus infections in the capital.The prime minister is said to be looking at restricting travel beyond the M25 and putting a stop to overnight stays at other people\u0027s\u0026nbsphouses - similar to policies seen\u0026nbspin Leicester and parts of the northern England - to avoid a second wave.The ideas are part of a government blueprint drawn up by government officials to avoid a second national lockdown, according to\u0026nbspThe Sunday Times\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspThe Sunday .However, Downing Street sources distanced themselves from the detail in the reports, calling them speculative.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? Adam Sandler blazes like a diamond-drill in Josh and Benny Safdie’s sensory-rush drama about a jeweller and gambling addict trying to hold onto his sanity as his world comes crashing down. It’s an exhausting, sometimes overwhelming watch – but with Sandler as the audience’s lodestar, it’s a journey worth staying with.Noah Baumbach draws on the breakdown of his marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh in this unflinching chronicling of a modern orce. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time.

Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day.

A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be “lengthy,” the World Health Organisation has warned after its emergency committee met to evaluate the crisis six months after first declaring an international emergency.A “nuanced” approach to tackling Covid-19 is needed to reduce the risk of “response fatigue” as the diseases places continued social and economic pressures on countries, the panel said.The committee gathered in Geneva on Friday exactly six months on from its declaration that coronavirus was public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), its highest level of alert.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“WHO continues to assess the global risk level of Covid-19 to be very high,” the organisation said in a statement issued on Saturday.“The committee highlighted the anticipated lengthy duration of this Covid-19 pandemic, noting the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.”‘Worst yet to come’ in coronavirus pandemic, warns WHOThe virus has killed more than 680,500 people worldwide and infected at least 17.6 million, according to a tally by researchers at Johns Hopkins University.The WHO warned this week the global spread of the disease is still accelerating, with the number of cases doubling in the past six weeks.During Friday’s meeting, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the committee: “It’s sobering to think that six months ago, when you recommended I declare a PHEIC, there were less than 100 cases and no deaths outside China.”“The pandemic is a once-in-a-century health crisis, the effects of which will be felt for decades to come,” he added.The emergency committee advised the WHO to provide “nuanced, pragmatic guidance on criteria for appropriate Covid-19 response activities to reduce the risk of response fatigue in the context of socio-economic pressures”.It also called for more research into “critical unknowns”, such as the animal source of the disease and long-term health impacts in survivors.The committee will meet again within three months.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From the start, Kate was horried at the way Meghan spoke to staff members at Kensington Palace and it was clear they would never click in the way Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson had once done.The now infamous tiara row, which I first revealed in November , was the culmination of many fallouts before the wedding.Afterwards, William and the Queen’s dresser and closest confidante, Angela Kelly, were united in their decision not to loan Meghan items from the Royal Collection, which included tiaras worn by Diana.As I began to report these stories, it is true to say Harry and Meghan became suspicious of their own staff, incorrectly believing they had been somehow hijacked by dark forces, the so-called “men in grey suits”, at Buckingham Palace.That categorisation is too simplistic.Who are these men  They may have existed in , but the senior figures in key roles behind the scenes within the Royal Family tend to be thoroughly modern members of the metropolitan elite these days.While it is correct to say they encouraged the couple to follow more conventional processes in terms of their dealings with other royal households and the Press, the real-le Sussex Squad was doggedly committed to the couple’s principles and goals.For example, their communications chief Sara Latham — blamed by Meghan for any negative stories in British newspapers — was a highly successful opera- tor who had worked for Hillary Clinton.She was prepared to pack up her le in London and move to Africa with the couple perman- ently to help achieve their humanitarian goals.Much official time and energy was put into the South African relocation planonly for the couple to eventually brand it too dficult.Instead, Harry and Meghan foolishly began to rely almost entirely on advice provided by a small team of fiercely loyal Hollywood advisers.I managed to unpick details of this secret cabal throughout the latter half of last year, but they had been causing major headaches for Buckingham Palace long before that.The group — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are typical Hollywood “Yes” people.Just as important were her PR advisers from the controversial crisis management firm Sunshine Sachs, specically Shawn Sachs and Keleigh Thomas Morgan.They had all become close with Meghan while she was a moderate star on the cable TV legal drama Suits, an era when she was so desperate for coverage in magazines she would even set up shots with paparazzi photog- raphers.She kept the Hollywood crew largely on the sidelines during the early days of her courtship with Harry. But as tensions with royal courtiers increased, so too did Meghan’s contact with them.It was this team who bunkered down with Meghan over Christmas and New Year in Canada, secretly drafting the content for the Sussex Royal website that, when published,like a Hollywood press release than a statement of intent by two senior members of the British Royal Family.Much has been written about how I broke the story of Megxit, with the finger incorrectly being pointed at both Clarence House and Kensington Palace.The couple like to promote the idea that they were somehow ambushed into revealing their plans after we published the world exclusive on January .However, they neglect to mention I had originally put the story to their office ten days earlier and had discussed every aspect of what we eventually published with their officials.It is not a coincidence my first story of the move included details of the Sussexes’ unhappiness about the release of photographs over Christmas featuring the Queen, Charles, William and George.The biography goes further by pointing to the absence of a picture of Harry, Meghan and Archie on the Queen’s table during her annual Christmas Day message.It is inconceivable to me that this wasn’t a purposeful slight by the institution, trying to make a point to Harry and Meghan: “Come back and join the party during events like Christmas or we’ll pretend you don’t exist.”It backfired spectacularly.So can such a toxic relationship be healed There is a growing acknowledgement from both sides that so long as Harry and Meghan’s romantic relationship remains strong, that is highly unlikely.But this book is a spectacular own goal by a couple who like to insist they are opposed to bitchy off-the-record briefings and royal revelations using source quotes slagging off other members of The Firm.Because fundamentally, that’s all Finding Freedom is.Unlike Andrew Morton’s game-changing Diana: Her True Story, there is no revelation that makes you think dferently about what went on.A couple desperate to blame others for their unwise decisions have allowed a fanboy “journalist” to confirm a whole load of newspaper exclusives, which they incidentally denied at the time, but spun with their own, often , narrative.Harry and Meghan are not victims of the media, the establishment or the British public.I will never forget that beautul spring day in May  when the entire country celebrated a royal wedding with the type of hope and joy not seen since July , when Charles and Diana tied the knot.It was one of those rare moments, like the London  Olympics, when we celebrated as one.This couple had the world at their feet — superstardom and influence any film actor or pop star would dream of, but without the cumbersome pressure of the throne hanging over them, like the Cambridges.They had a very real chance to help reinvent and modernise the monarchy from within.What a tragedy they have chosen to focus their energies on settling scores in tawdry tell-alls and unnecessary courtroom battles.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you live in the affected areas, you should not visit someones home or garden regardless of whether this is in or outside of the restricted area.The mixup came as England was hit with  new positive cases – the highest number in  days – adding to fears the country is facing a second wave of the virus.But the sudden new rules - which means that people can still go to work and even visit shops and cafes - have left Brits reeling after they were introduced about .pm, barely three hours before they were put into force.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to discuss the matter in his coronavirus press conference today.What the new rules mean:About .million people will be affected by the new lockdown rules - which are expected to be subject to a weekly review.The affected areas include all of the .million residents of Greater Manchester, as well as the Lancashire towns of Blackburn, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendle and Rossendale.West Yorkshire, Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees were also hit.Leicester was also included in the households ban, but pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will reopen on Monday.However, leisure centres, gyms and pools will remain closed.Earlier Mr Hancock has admitted Muslims living in the area will have their Eid celebrations affected.He said: My heart goes out to the Muslim community. I know that this will have a particular impact on Eid celebrations. Weve been working with Imams and religious leaders to ensure that Eid celebrations can go ahead in a co-vid secure way in mosques and there are some really innovative proposals to celebrate in parks where social distancing is easier and theres more space. But it does mean, for everybody, meetings between households wont be possible and of course that has a particular impact when theres a celebration like Eid coming up for the Muslim community. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi today slammed the lack of clarity over the message on Good Morning Britain, saying she had received calls up to am overnight by confused members of the community.She said: “There is still not clarity on whether that means you can meet outdoors, thankfully there is still some clarication that those mosques that had prepared for Covid Eid prayers with the proper procedures would be allowed to go ahead.“People have voluntarily been part of this response and I think it would have been better to do this with a little more understanding and clarity.”Labour leader Keir Starmer said he would not argue with local action to reduce the transmission of the virus but said: Announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis.He added: For all the bluster, government has failed to deliver a ing track and trace system that would spot local flare ups like these.Lucy Powell, the MP for Manchester Central, said she had been blindsided by the new rules.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning was left trying to defend the move, saying the move had been absolutely necessary.Speaking to Sky News, he said the new rules were crystal clear, saying the test and trace data had shown most of the transmission is happening between households.He added: Everyone can see that the problem with this virus is it thrives on the social contact that makes le worth living.The Health Secretary had last night said he was introducing the new measures with a heavy heart - tweeting the announcement at .pm with details published two hours later before the full guidelines were released this morning.Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said there had been a “marked change” across his boroughs in recent days.Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, he said: The truth of the matter is the pub is a more regulated environment, as is public transport where people are supposed to wear face masks.The home is a less regulated.And he defended the sudden introduction of the new guidelines, saying the virus could move quickly.Lib Dem leader Ed Davey wrote: How this lockdown in Manchester, East Lancs  West Yorks has been introduced is worrying, confusing, frustrating and damaging.No-one doubts these are dficult decisions - but when lives of millions of people are involved, Ministers have a duty to communicate professionally.Others took issue with Wigan being included in the fresh lockdown rules, saying that it had been lumped in with Greater Manchesters rise without recording an increase itself.One local tweeted: Wigan has the lowest rate of cases in Greater Manchester... its not our fault other parts of Manchester are letting the side down.Another added: Wigan has  cases per , and is on lockdown.

Prince Harry’s actress ex Cressida Bonas had secretly tied the knot to beau Harry Wentworth-Stanley in a private country ceremony. The actress previously dated the Duke of Sussex for three years after being introduced by Princess Eugenie, before breaking off their relationship in April  – allegedly after getting spooked by the idea of le as a royal.And while Harry has since quit royal le to get married and move to LA with we Meghan Markle and son Archie, here’s a closer look at what the -year-old’s reported former flames have been up to since.Arguably his most serious relationship before Meghan, Prince Harry was in an on-off relationship with Chelsy Davy, now , for six years from .However, the Zimbabwe-born former law student struggled to cope with the scrutiny that came with dating a royal, telling The Times: “It was so full on: crazy and scary and uncomfortable.” Following their split, the pair maintained a good friendship, with Chelsy even attending Harry’s  wedding. Now, businesswoman Chelsy is a jewellery designer who ides her time between Africa and the UK, and recently revealed she’s started dating someone new.  While a romance was never officially confirmed by either party, presenter Natalie Pinkham, now , and Prince Harry were rumoured to be an item briefly in , and the pair even enjoyed a holiday together in Botswana -–a place he most recently took Meghan. Whether it was a romantic trip or not, the pair remained friends for years – however, Natalie was reportedly ‘ghosted’ by the prince after his  nuptials, with a friend telling The Sun: “When Harry got together with Meghan their relationship rapidly changed – it just went flat and noticeably cooled off.”Now, Natalie continues to work as a F Sky Sports presenter, and is happily married to TV exec husband Owain Walbyoff, who she shares two children with. The pair married in  in Portugal in front of star studded guests including Harry’s cousin, Zara Phillips, and recently celebrated their eighth wedding anniversary. Former lingerie model Cassie Sumner met the prince in  on a night out at Chinawhite nightclub – and went on to reveal details of the one night fling in an interview, claiming he kissed Towie reality star Lauren Pope earlier the same evening. However it wasn’t a serious or long-lasting romance, and Cassie went on to marry footballer Jose Fonte.Now, the couple have two children together.Kate Middleton’s very well connected friend Astrid Harbord – who attended the Duchess’ hen do – and Harry were linked in , after being spotted hanging out together in London. However, while the pair have been pictured at the same events over the years, Harry reportedly ‘cut ties’ with the glam socialite once he started dating Meghan. Now, Astrid is a company director, and founder of Lady Garden, a national women’s health charity encouraging conversation about gynaecological health. When bomb disposal expert Camilla Thurlow joined Love Island in , rumours began to swirl about her  dalliance with Harry – although the now -year-old reality TV star remained tight-lipped on the ITV show. Since then, Camilla’s quest to find true love has paid off, and she remains in one of the few successful Love Island relationships with co-star, model Jamie Jewitt, with the pair recently announcing they’re expecting their first child together.Camilla, who also recently published a book, isn’t the only Love Island star Prince Harry has been linked to. Presenter Caroline Flack, who tragically took her own le earlier this year aged just , had also once been romantically associated to the prince, describing herself as his “bit of rough” after the pair were introduced via mutual friends in .Norwegian rock star Camilla Romestrand – lead singer of band Eddie the Gun – claimed she stayed over at Clarence House and Prince Harry served her breakfast in bed – an account never confirmed by the prince. Now, the Scandinavian beauty is a mum of two with a passion for vegan cooking, and lives predominantly out of the spotlight. Model Florence Brudenell-Bruce, or Flee as she’s known to close friends, had known Harry for a few years before they were linked romantically in , just after his final split from Chelsy. Flee, now , had another high-profile romance when she dated Formula One racing driver Jenson Button until .She went on to marry multi-millionaire Henry St George in , in a romantic ceremony in the south of France, and the couple now have two children.Most recently, she starred in Channel ’s The Great Pottery Throwdown, after revealing shes got into ceramics to overcome post-natal depression. Saturdays pop princess Mollie King, now , bagged herself a few dates with Harry in , and speaking at the time, the singer confessed: “Yes, I have met Harry, and we did go out for a drink.”However, her public profile was dficult to navigate for Harry, and he reportedly called things off.Meanwhile Mollie went on to date supermodel David Gandy for five years, star on Strictly and land a BBC Radio One presenting job. Now, Mollie’s happily loved up with England cricketer boyfriend Stuart Broad, who she’s been dating on and off since early . After being pictured “canoodling” at a polo match together in , singer Ellie Goulding and Prince Harry were reportedly an item, exchanging flirty texts, with one onlooker even claiming they shared a kiss while under a blanket. They became close after Ellie performed at his brother William’s wedding to Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, and she attended the Invictus Games with the prince in . While things clearly didn’t work out, the pop star still had her own ‘royal wedding’ at York Minster Cathedral, which was estimated could have cost up to £million. Guests included Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, royal photographer Matt Porteous captured their big day, and crowds lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the bride as she made her way to the altar to wed art dealer Casper Jopling. It hasn’t all been smooth sailing however – Ellie recently revealed she hadn’t seen her mother Tracey since the wedding last August. Doctor Who actress Jenna Coleman was rumoured to have briefly dated Harry in , with the Duke pictured resting his hand on Jenna’s leg at a posh polo party. However, it didn’t last, and when their paths crossed in  while Harry was on a secret trip to Amsterdam with Meghan, the pair had an ‘awkward’ encounter and avoided speaking, with a source telling Vanity Fair: “It was pretty awkward and some of the other guests were commenting on it.Jenna looked down while Harry looked straight ahead, while Meghan didn’t seem to notice.Jenna, now , went on to date Victoria co-star Tom Hughes for four years, before splitting recently, with a source telling The Sun: “Both Tom and Jenna are terribly sad, but the relationship ran its course. “Jenna’s career is going from strength to strength, she’s being offered increasingly more roles abroad, especially Los Angeles, and she wants to focus on this while she’s still young.”So while Prince Harry has moved on from his lothario days to settle down, given the amount of lavish weddings and babies among them, it seems the majority of his past loves have also quite happily been able to put their royal romance behind them too. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make

She has always been there in the background, just quietly getting on with it, with absolutely no fuss.Fuss, in fact, is clearly something that the royal has no time for as Anne was astonished to learn it takes Erin Doherty — the actress who plays her in the third series of The Crown — two hours to style her hair, as opposed to the “ten or  minutes” it takes Anne. I loved the portrayal of the young princess in the Netflix series: Down to earth, feisty and straightforward, which I suspect is accurate to a tee.I have always wondered whether the royals watch the drama and Princess Anne revealed she did and found it “quite interesting”.She was followed for more than a year by the filmmakers of Anne: The Princess Royal At , which also featured unseen family footage and interviews with her loved ones.I loved the stories from her children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, describing how she wouldfrom royal s in her glamorous outfits and head straight to their farm to tend to the animals.Zara said: “She’d come home from engagements in exactly what she was wearing, make-up on, put her welly boots on, jacket on, do her chickens and get her eggs.”The appealing thing about Princess Anne is her work ethic and how happy she is to stay in the background.Her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said: “She’s not a person that is constantly looking for praise. She gets on and does her work regardless because she thinks it’s important.”So it came as no surprise when Anne declared in the documentary that she would not go on Twitter “evenyou paid me”.Princess Anne is not the only hard-working royal, of course.Her brother Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, do loads of good work and are similarly modest in their approach.These members of the Royal Family are in stark contrast to Harry and Meghan, who claim that work is more important than anything , but rarely get on with it quietly.After all, Princess Anne does her job brilliantly, with no whinging or whining, and still remains out of the spotlight, which proves it can be done.Another appealing trait of Anne’s is her modesty about how hard she works. She has no intention of slowing down, despite being old enough to retire.She’s a credit to her family and the Queen — and the two of them clearly have a lot in common.I loved watching them interact and seeing that mother-daughter bond. You can see there’s real affection there. And what a great, dry sense of humour they both have.So it’s nice to watch something positive about the Royal Family these days.By simply being herself in the documentary, Princess Anne has generated more positive PR for the monarchy than it has had in a very long while.LOOKING at pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram promoting a ready-to-drink brand of organic cocktails, I found myself thinking that no matter how much some people want to hate her, Gwyneth comes across as enviably wholesome, gorgeous, healthy . . . and probably a really nice person.The bottom line is that anyone who says they hate her is almost certainly just jealous.I AM so proud our national game has signed up to the Mentally Healthy Football Declaration, which urges young men – and men of all ages, in fact – to talk about their feelings, which is something males traditionally seem to struggle with.We can talk about the THEORY of mental health all we like but the power of role models, particularly for young guys, is immense.So it is lovely to see some footballing greats being open and honest about their own mental health – and the fact things haven’t always necessarily been rosy in the garden throughout their lives.Spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge, the campaign is designed to make mental health a priority across all levels of football.So kudos to former England captain David Beckham, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend and Manchester City and England skipper Steph Houghton for talking frankly about their own mental health and the state of play in football more generally.Beckham, in particular, yields great influence. Hearing him talk about the effects of being vilied and abused by fans after he was red-carded against Argentina in the  World Cup was very powerful.“When I look back on it now, I didn’t realise how hard it was,” he says. “The times I’ve faced adversity throughout my career – and ’ was by far the toughest – did I feel OK to go to someone and say I needed help  No. I felt I had to keep it all in and deal with it myself.“Now I’m preaching to my kids and to other kids that it’s really important to talk. It’s OK not to be OK and it’s OK to say that.

I knew straight away it was a house on fire so I drove there and found it was down Garths End. I was one of the first to arrive before the emergency services.Owners of parked cars jumped into their vehicles after being alerted by fire fighters to drive them away from the wall of heat and prevent secondary explosions.A North Yorkshire Fire Service spokesperson said: Five crews from Huntington, York and Acomb have dealt with a fire to a domestic property following a lightning strike.

My colleagues both in those settings and in other settings share my views.Ive not come across somebody who has said that visors are the best thing.Dr Ben Killingley, a consultant in infectious diseases who sits on Nervtag, said: I dont know where it came from, where someone decided that just wearing a visor for hairdressers alone would be enough. That doesnt make sense to me.A visor is primarily worn to protect workers from splashes. It does the same job as goggles, protecting the eyes. No healthcare worker would ever wear a visor without a mask.You would have thought for their own protection and just in case they have been infected themselves, they should be wearing a mask themselves. In my view, both to protect the hairdresser and the person coming in, just wearing a visor alone is not enough.Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of Nervtag, tweeted his concerns, after a haircut by a barber wearing a face shield.His expelled breath and droplets were directed down onto me, Prof Openshaw tweeted. Zero protection, Id say.He added that while his own mask provided protection against possible viral droplets, it would have failed to prevent corneal seeding, where Covid- particles enter the eyes.The concerns come after Prime Minister Boris Johnson hit the brakes on easing the coronavirus lockdown - saying he wouldnt stand by and allow the virus to cause more pain and heartache in this country.He announced that most of the measures which were to be lted today would now be put on ice for two weeks.He also hinted at backtracking the easing of lockdown even further after new rules banning households from meeting each other in homes were announced for Greater Manchester, parts of East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire overnight.Dr Killingley cited a study in the US which found that no Covid- cases were reported among  clients who were exposed to two asymptomatic hair stylists in Missouri.Both of the stylists were wearing surgical masks or cotton face coverings at each appointment, as were their clients.The government’s current advice for those working in “close contact services” such as hairdressers and beauty salons, states: Clearly, when providing close contact services, it often may not be possible to maintain social distancing guidelines .As a result, personal protective equipment in the form of a visor will be required to mitigate the risk.The NHBF, the trade body for hairdressers, beauty salons and barbers, states on its website: Clients may wear face coveringsthey wish and staff can wear a face covering in addition to a visor, but not instead of one.It added it relied on the Government for advice about personal protective equipment.A Government spokesman said: “Advice for hairdressers remains unchanged and is that they should continue to wear visors. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

However, we prepare for all scenarios, and officials are currently drawing up an array of policy options to present to the Prime Minister.More than two million people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland were advised to shield in their homes until the end of July.In Wales, the advice remains in place until August .Butthe new proposals are given the green light, even more people would be asked to shield based on their age or particular risk factors.Among people already diagnosed with Covid-, people aged  or older were  times more likely to die than those under . Officials have also stated that people with diabetes, heart disease and dementia all appear to be at higher risk of death.Its reported that experts are considering shielding afternoons or hours which will allow the most vulnerable to get to shops and services without worrying about the virus being transmitted.Early on into the UKs lockdown, supermarkets introduced priority shopping hours for those most at risk.Butthe new measure is brought in, it would require very intensive screening of all those likely to come into contact with a vulnerable person - from care home staff to family.Academics in Edinburgh said in April thatcoronavirus was circulating just in the non-vulnerable population, the NHS could easily cope with the levels of mild disease, some hospitalisations and occasional critical care.They added: Numbers of deaths would be low.Another option on the table is that Londoners would be prevented from travelling outside the Mtheres another spike in the capital.Quarantine measures for travellers landing in the UK could also be increased.The Government is also thought to be considering implementing a national ban on people from dferent households meeting indoors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s not their fault for not being able to speak English so much as the failure of local councils to give them access to learning it.“It explains why people end up being exploited.

Some of them have ided communities by putting lots of money in which have separated them from everybody .“If we are using the public purse to support communities there has to be some mechanism to ask local councils how they intend to spend the money.”Official figures shows Asian and Asian British people made up a third of those who tested positive for coronavirus in the week up to July .Public Health England stats revealed  per cent of positive cases in England were among the Asian and Asian British population.

But another option is a ban on bubbles, which allow up to  people from two households to meet indoors except for in the North West.A source said: “We want to avoid a second national lockdown at all costs and a lot will depend on how we can keep a lid on things.” Mr Johnson slammed the brakes on the easing of restrictions on Friday after receiving new data from the Test and Trace system.Then Boris Johnson was predicting near normality by Christmas and we could see fairy lights at the end of the tunnel.Since then the Government has been forced to slam on the brakes, with last-minute restrictions on holidaymakers and local lockdowns in large parts of the North.And there is more pain to come over fears a second spike has already started.Government scientists know the virus is mainly being spread by friends and relatives meeting up in their homes.So a fresh ban on indoor get-togethers cannot be ruled out.The irresponsible behaviour of Covidiots like former England star Paul Scholes illustrates the scale of the problem. Hosting an overnight house party in a high-risk lockdown area is not an example we want young people to follow.Suggestions that many who don’t speak English haven’t even been informed of the restrictions because of lack of translations is also appalling. Tory peer Baroness Verma today claims thousands in Leicester have never been sent information on the pandemic in their own language. If true, this is a disgrace.Politicians find the money to translate election leaflets when chasing votes.Safety advice must be spelled out loud and clear in every language whatever the cost.The biggest cause of infection was people visiting or inviting visitors to their home. Another option being considered is for sick, elderly and vulnerable people to be ordered to stay at home.Meanwhile, No denied claims the full re-opening of schools is under threat.

The Wuhan wet market was just used as a decoy.Scientists currently believe that the virus may have originated at a wet market in Wuhan were it jumped from animals to humans.Dr Lifearedshe spoke up she would be snatched, so decided to flee to the US from Hong Kong on a Cathay Pacic flight in April.I knew that once I spoke up, I could disappear at any time, just like all the brave protesters in Hong Kong, she said.I could disappear at any time. Even my name would no longer exist.The University of Hong Kong has previously denied that she carried out research on human-to-human transmission of the disease, and said her assertions do not accord with the key facts.Previously in an interview with Fox News, Dr Li claimed she was one of the first people to begin researching the new virus.The reason I came to the US is because I deliver the message of the truth of Covid, she said.Dr Li said she her supervisor first asked her to conduct a secret investigation into a new SARS-like virus in Wuhan on December .She said she then spoke to a number of contacts, including one who worked at Chinas Center for Disease Control and Prevention.She said the friend told her of an unknown virus that had emerged in Wuhan and that family cluster cases, an indicator of human-to-human transmission, had been observed.Dr Li claims that, when she took her findings to her superior, she was told to keep silent and be careful.He warned me..., Dont touch the red line, Dr Li said, referring to the unspoken limits placed by Beijing on such investigations.Since the coronavirus pandemic took hold, the Chinese government has faced accusations that it sought to silence anyone who had earlier tried to raise the alarm.Doctors have reported being detained after speaking out on social media about what they were witnessing, while journalists have recounted being harassed and having their equipment confiscated after trying to report on the issue.The virus spread out from China, and has now infected million people worldwide and killed almost ,.China strongly denies any allegations of improper behaviour over its handling of the pandemic, but the US continues to hammer them over the pandemic.US President Donald Trump continues to call the pandemic the China Virus and has accused China of covering up the virus.The Trump administration has even gone as far as suggesting the pathogen could be man made - and they have evidence.China has recorded , cases and , deaths, while the US has seen .million and , deaths.Taking a tough line, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called for free nations of the world to help take on China.Mr Pompeo warned: If the free world doesn’t change Communist China, Communist China will change us.The pandemic has seen diplomatic relations plunge, with both the US and China ordering the other to shut down consulates in a tit-for-tat row.The US has pledged to pull its funding from the World Health Organisation over allegations it is China-centric.Meanwhile, a bombshell spy dossier claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that Chinas secrecy surrounding the virus led to an assault on international transparency.It said: Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC authorities deny it until January .”The scientic consensus is that Covid- originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, but there is so far no concrete evidence linking it to a Chinese lab.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I’m completely convinced it really helps.I’ve always had hay fever, although for years I had terrible sinus trouble that often left me with debilitating headaches, so I chalked it up to that.Five years ago Al was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. He had corrective surgery and his surgeon said he could tell he was a hay fever sufferer, but said his symptoms may have been shielded due to the issues with his sinuses. Sadly he was right, the headaches disappeared, but the following spring my eyes itched and streamed, I was sneezing and coughing and I completely lost my voice - a real blow as I sing a lot as a hobby.I was fed up feeling so awful so started to do some research, which is how I stumbled upon the nettle theory.Its the idea being that by stinging yourself you force a natural histamine reaction, effectively normalising it in your body which means it then has a lesser histamine reaction when the pollen comes in.I thought I had nothing to lose, so took myself out and ran my forearms along a bank of nettles in a local park.After this Al said he developed a rash which itched for  hours. The next few times he decided to sting himself, he said it wasnt so bad.Over time the stinging results in little more than just a few bumps and little mild itching which only lasts ten minutes or so.I have done it every year since as soon as the nettles appear in spring.It’s made a huge dference: don’t lose my voice anymore – I’m not sneezing all the time and my eyes aren’t running. It may not be for everyone – but it works for me.Since the beginning of March many hay fever sufferers have been told to keep an eye on their symptoms as many can be similar to the coronavirus.Clinical care dietician Kimberly Burton didnt have hay fever when she was younger and said it came out of nowhere in her early s.The -year-old from Nottingham said that over the years her symptoms got worse and led her to visit her GP.She said the condition has even had an impact on her job and added that sometimes her eyes are so puffy that people think she has a black eye.So I’m used to all the symptoms – but this year, about a month ago, I woke up to find my sense of taste had disappeared overnight – something the government had recently said was a recognised symptom of Covid-. I rang  – who said as this was a clear symptom the guidance was I would need to get tested.I was really worried. Part of me was still convinced it was hay fever, but then I spoke to a friend who had also lost her sense of taste, thought it was hay fever then tested positive for the coronavirus.As a health worker Kimberly said it was pretty straightforward for her to get a test and the results came back the next day and were thankfully negative.Now though I’m worried thatI lose my sense of taste again – which I may well do,this is a new symptom I’ve developed – then I am going to have to have a Covid- test every time, she added.While Kimberly only developed hay fever later on in le, one woman says it was motherhood that spurred on her symptoms.Hannah Boothby is mum to eight-year-old Tyler and Emmett, .The -year-old from Milton Keynes said that within weeks of giving birth to her second child Emmett, she started sneezing horrendously and developed really itchy eyes and a scratchy sore throat.Hannah put it down to post birth fatigued and hormones and her health adviser at the time agreed that this was likely the case.. AntihistaminesAntihistamine tablets, capsules and sprays can relieve most hay fever symptoms – sneezing, itchy, runny eyes, skin irritation, itchy nose and throat – but are less effective for nasal congestion.Although strong antihistamines can be prescribed by a GP, most people buy antihistamines over the counter in a pharmacy.These usually contain either Cetirizine or Loratadine. If one doesn’t work for you, you can try the other one.Some contain chlorphenamine and these are more liable to make you drowsy. All antihistamines can make you drowsy and it is illegal to drivethey do. It is also dangerous to operate machinery.. Steroid nasal spraysSteroid nasal sprays help reduce inflammation in the nose.They work best for clearing nasal symptoms – itching, sneezing, watering and congestion – although sprays sometimes clear eye symptoms too.Again, look for the active ingredients - beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone or mometasone – own brand versions can be cheaper.. Allergen barrier balmsOrganic drug-free allergen barrier balms such as HayMax are applied to the nostrils and bones of the eyes in the morning and throughout the day.They are used to stop allergens from entering the body through the nose.They are especially useful as they can be used immediately, together with other hay fever products and are suitable for children and pregnant and breastfeeding women.”. Immune supportTaking products that can help boost your immune system can be useful.Bee Prepared Daily Defence Immune Support is an immune boosting wellness formula for adults and children that contains all natural ingredients which have a history of benefits and clinically researched actions which help support the immune system.Please note that this product isn’t suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding mums.. Acupressure bandsAcupressure is a non-invasive form of acupuncture, achieved by applying physical pressure of hands, elbows, feet or devices to the same acupuncture points.It is used in a wide iety of conditions including hay fever. The Qu-Chi Hay Fever Band uses acupressure to target key pressure points on the body associated with allergy symptoms.The band is worn on one of these pressure points, the elbow. Adult and child sizes are available. This product is not suitable for pregnant womenIt didn’t even occur to me it could be hay fever – even though my husband Joel, who has had it since he was a boy, kept telling me I had all the symptoms.I stuck to my guns – as far as I saw it I didn’t suffer from allergies and I was just run down from the sleepless nights of being a new mum.She said after a few weeks her symptoms became similar to her husbands and he suggested that she try one of his anti histamines.Hannah said that this made a big dference.Grudgingly I had to accept that I had hay fever after all – and the only thing that had changed in my le in the last few months was having a baby.I was so intrigued that I googled whether giving birth can give you hay fever and found there while there is nothing conclusive out there were quite a few other mums who had experienced the same thing.Either way, it seems to me to be too much of a coincidence – and I can’t help wondering whether the fact that Emmett has a cow’s milk allergy is somehow linked.She said the itchy eyes are the worst part and said to soothe them she sometimes put cold chamomile tea bags on her eyes that she has kept in the fridge over night.It’s annoying, but it’s a small price to pay for having my lovely boy, she added.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Government ministers have been warned that the plastic face visors worn by hairdressers leaves a gap that airborne coronvirus droplets could pass through. They are now facing calls to revise guidance to barbers and hairdressers and require them to wear face masks, as well as the visors. Scientists are said to have raised the concerns in the latest meeting of The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Groupon Friday.The issues was also discussed in a recent meeting of at least one sub-committee of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , the Dailyreports.Prof Mark Wilcox, a professor of medical microbiology who attends Sage and two of its sub committees, said: I donapost think the guidance is correct and I donapost understand why visors were chosen in preference to masks. We have, in several settings, discussed the issue of masks versus visors and I think it would be fair to say that I am not alone in these views. My colleagues both in those settings and in other settings share my views. Iaposve not come across somebody who has said that visors are the best thing. Dr Ben Killingley, a consultant in infectious diseases who sits on Nervtag, said: I donapost know where it came from, where someone decided that just wearing a visor for hairdressers alone would be enough. That doesnapost make sense to me. A visor is primarily worn to protect workers from splashes. It does the same job as goggles, protecting the eyes. No healthcare worker would ever wear a visor without a mask. You would have thought for their own protection and just in case they have been infected themselves, they should be wearing a mask themselves. In my view, both to protect the hairdresser and the person coming in, just wearing a visor alone is not enough. Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of Nervtag, tweeted his concerns, after a haircut by a barber wearing a face shield. His expelled breath and droplets were directed down onto me, Prof Openshaw tweeted. Zero protection, Iaposd say. He added that while his own mask provided protection against possible viral droplets, it would have failed to prevent corneal seeding, where Covid- particles enter the eyes.The concerns come after SAGE said it could not be confident that the crucial coronavirus aposRapos rate is currently below one in England. Boris Johnson  on Friday paused the easing of lockdown as fears grow that a surge of cases in some areas of northern England could turn into a second wave.Towns in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire have been slapped with fresh restrictions with social gatherings banned indoors and in private gardens. Meanwhile, ministers have been warned by experts that trade-offs, such as the closing of pubs, could be needed for schools to fully reopen in September.

You can’t visit a neighbour in their house, but you can sit near them in a pub. Soyou want to see their house they have to call it The Grape and Flamingo and charge you £ for a bowl of chilli. Then you can sit in there with a pile of strangers, which is much safer. The lockdown announcements are like the instructions for a s game show: “You can only mix with six people in your bubble, who can only be in one other bubble or a ‘bubblette’ of five people you’ve never heard of, who must live in your kitchen unless you play the Joker. “Then you can shout, ‘I’m getting me eyes tested’ and ignore all the rules for  seconds until you hear this noise: WAAAWAAKERCHINGLE. Then you must climb the ladder to the self-isolation unit and shout ‘Coronavirus’ to win this magnicent set of carving knives.” In designated towns deemed high-risk, such as Oldham, you will still be allowed into pubs, but must wear a mask at all times. So you will be permitted to buy alcohol, but you must pour it down your front, at no time removing the mask to put any drink in your mouth. If you are in a lockdown area you have to comply with extra restrictions – unless you leave the lockdown area illegally to go to a non-lockdown area, which is perfectly legal.  This follows clear guidelines from the Government all along, that it’s fine to shake hands with infected people as long as you don’t touch them in any way.Then we were told masks make no dference, which must be why it’s now the law to wear them, as the only waywe can defeat the virus is by making no dference.So maybe the reason they changed their mind is it’s a fetish of Dominic Raab’s. His next statement will be: “Our scientists advise we must all wear knee-high boots and nipple clamps.” There are rules for pubs and cafés about music and talking too loudly. There’s probably one that you can’t use words starting with P as that makes you spit out virus germs, but you can say “pharmacy as it’s a silent P. It’s best to check with the police first, but you mustn’t call them “police” as that starts with P so you must refer to them as “constabulary” or “filth” but not “pigs”. To make sure everyone understood the new rules for Manchester, they were announced at pm on Twitter. That’s how to ensure everything is followed clearly.

Boris Johnson on Friday paused the easing of lockdown as fears grow that a surge of cases in some areas of northern England could turn into a second wave.Towns in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire have been slapped with fresh restrictions with social gatherings banned indoors and in private gardens. Meanwhile, ministers have been warned by experts that trade-offs, such as the closing of pubs, could be needed for schools to fully reopen in September. And it is reported by the Sundayand Sunday Times that a radical blueprint to avoid a second lockdown, something the prime minister recently likened to the nuclear deterrent, has been drawn up. The elderly and vulnerable could be asked once again to stay at home to enable the younger, less susceptible people to continue working while keeping death rates low. Part of the enhanced or dferential shielding plans could be to have exclusive weekly slots for the elderly to visit shops and access services. A city-wide lockdown on London is also reportedly being considered, with restrictions on travel in and out of the M in the event of a spike of cases in the capital. The Sunday Times said Mr Johnson held a war game session with Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Wednesday to run through possible options for averting another nationwide lockdown that could stall any potential economic recovery.Meanwhile tightening quarantine restrictions on those flying into the UK and “harder”local lockdowns than the restrictions imposed last week are all under consideration. The change in tone from the government comes after a small uptick in coronavirus cases nationally over the last few weeks in the UK.Just a few weeks ago, Mr Johnson was speaking of ato normality by Christmas. But since then he spoke of signs of a second wave in Europe, with daily cases back over , in Spain, prompting the country to be removed from the UKaposs quarantine-free travel list.A senior Whitehall source told the : “We are hopeful that fast action, regionallockdowns and quarantines will stop the need for any more substantive action. However we prepare for all scenarios, and officials are currently drawing up an array of policy options to present to the Prime Minister.” The blueprint to avoid another lockdown comes after people shielding were finally freed from the shackles for the first time on Saturday. In Wales, the advice remains in place until August . The enhanced shielding plans may include more people, based on ages and risk factors identied since March. It could even see those aged between  and  given personalised risk ratings, said the Times It is believed that encouraging “shielding afternoons” or “shielding hours” for the most vulnerable to access shops and services is part of the plans.

Ministers will unveil a complete overhaul this week of the system that has been in place for  years in a bid to speed up new homes. Instead of residents being able to fight any inidual schemes from scratch, councils will ide land into three categories in advance. In the most liberal “growth” zone, developer giants will automatically have permission “in principle” to build homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices. Specics will still need approval, including complying with a design code, but the question will no longer be whether a scheme should be built at all.  There will also be a “permission in principle approach” in the second type of zone, “renewal”. Development will then be restricted in the third type of zone, “protected”, which will include the green belt and areas of outstanding natural beauty. A consultation is also set to suggest ending letters to every resident likely to be affected by a scheme. Instead there will be a move towards online notications. Notices would no longer appear on lamp posts. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick claimed the current system is a “barrier to building homes” and the changes will “cut red tape, not standards” - while speeding up vital new homes. Mr Jenrick also said there will be a “legal requirement to have tree-lined streets for all new developments”.  But council chiefs sounded the alarm. Local Government Association chairman James Jamieson said: “It is vital that any reforms provide the right protections so residents have the power to shape the area they live in. “Any suggestion that planning is a barrier to housebuilding is a myth. Nine in  planning applications are approved by councils, while more than a million homes given planning permission in the last decade have not yet been built. It comes just days after a report for the government found previous Tory “red tape” cutting led to homes as small as  square metres. The study of “permitted development” homes, which can be built in former office blocks, found just % would meet national space standards and  had no windows at all.  Mr Jamieson said: “The Government’s own independent report warned of the worse quality of homes not delivered through the planning system. “We urge the Government to heed these warnings and not further side-line the planning process.” The new system will ide up land through “local plans” drawn up by councils every few years. It’s understood some town halls may be forced to rip up their plans and redraw them to the new guidelines. Government sources said there will be “appropriate transition arrangements” for councils that have recently drawn up their local plan."},{"url":null,"title":"woman thinks so called friend","story":"NewsWoman thinks so-called friend spiked brownie to make her have sex with himWhen artist Ruth Poniarski ate a brownie spiked with angel dust at a party it drove the promising student to the brink of insanity which nearly claimed her leShareCommentsBySusanna GaltonDeputy Features Editor, Reach supplements:,  AUG NewsRuth Poniarski age  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

But a prank played on -year-old Ruth Poniarski at college was far too serious to shrug off the next day. It almost destroyed her. It was back in  when high-flying Ruth, then studying for an architecture degree, went to a small end of term party. ‘It wasn’t a wild affair, there were only about eight others there, all architecture graduates and physics PhD students,’ says Ruth, now .‘People had drunk a little wine but that was it. Everyone was heading home when a so-called friend, Joseph, produced some brownies and told me his professor’s we had made them. I was hungry and didn’t think to question, I just ate it.’What Ruth didn’t realise was the homemade cake had been laced with ‘angel dust’, the nickname for an anaesthetic called PCP, which stops pain but can also cause hallucinations. ‘I’d never heard of the drug before, but it’s an animal tranquilliser,’ she explains. ‘Within minutes I had started to decompensate, which medically means losing the ability to maintain my mental health. aposEveryone had left the party by now, I think Joseph thought it would make me want to have sex with him, but I had no interest in that whatsoever.‘I started hallucinating about being in this cavernous space with white candles everywhere. Then I felt dizzy and started shaking, I wanted to run away and escape out of the window, it was very disorientating.’Desperate to get away, Ruth ended up getting in her car and tried to drive back to her apartment in Long Island, New York. ‘Somehow, I was able to drive a few miles before I pulled over on the highway and began walking. In my head I was convinced there was some kind of revolution going on where Jewish people like me were being persecuted. When I lost my shoes I just carried on walking throughout the night until the sun started coming up.’Confused and bedraggled, Ruth went into a convenience shop where a kind stranger realised she was having a psychotic episode. He drove her home, calmly making small talk all the way to stabilise her during the frightening hallucinations.‘I looked a state, my hair was a mess, my clothes were soiled and I had bare feet. But his intervention that night saved my le.’ Back home, Ruth had to face her father and worried acquaintances – including Joseph. She was taken to a psychiatrist who gave her some medication to help, but it only made her more jittery. Ruth’s terrying drug-induced ‘trip’ lasted almost a week.  Joseph made a weak apology by writing a message inside a book, comparing himself to a stupid, headless character in the story. After he gave that to her, she never heard from him again and didn’t press charges. After her initial breakdown, Ruth was determined to carry on with her studies but struggled with feelings of inadequacy triggered by not having close friends to rely on. Sadly for her, it was to be the first of many mental breakdowns that spiralled into a diagnosis of psychosis, schizophrenia, severe anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Before the brownie incident she had no mental health issues. Every few months she had what she calls ‘an episode’ – mainly suffering in silence.‘No one knew of my breakdowns, I led a lonely le, concealing the truth from the few friends I had. I was afraidmy peers learned of my illness, they would shun me and call me “the crazy woman”. People just didn’t understand mental health back then. ‘It would flare up with no real warning, but social stresses would spur it on, like moving apartments, or when I signed up to a seminar on gaining confidence, I found it just all too much.‘I would go days without sleeping, and twice I didn’t sleep for seven days. I just caved into myself. I tried to study but couldn’t focus, I missed meals, and once slept rough for a night.’Ruth battled to balance a sense of purpose and normality with her trips to hospital. ‘I tried dferent prescribed drugs but back in the s and s they were not as advanced as what’s available today. They made me very jumpy.’ While her parents were loving, they were ill-equipped to deal with Ruth’s issues. In her disturbed mind, she felt they wanted to have her locked up. Ruth’s illness culminated in  when – then aged  – she fell three floors from her apartment window during a manic episode.‘I had bad anxiety and insomnia and the flat next door was renovating, so there was a constant drilling noise which compounded the state I was in.  aposI needed to escape the noise but in my delirious mind I daren’t exit the front door as bad people would get me. So I tied my bed sheets to my kitchen table leg and tried to abseil out of the window.’ From ft in the air Ruth crashed to the ground, breaking her back and both ankles. A neighbour heard the screams and called an ambulance.After an eight-hour operation on her back and a four-hour operation for each of the shattered ankles, Ruth was put into a full-body cast and was kept in intensive care for four days. When she woke up there, she was still in a manic state. ‘I was still delusional, I thought the doctors and nurses were going to kill me. I would be murdered in my bed.’Ruth spent a month in hospital before leaving in a wheelchair, with a doctor warning she might never walk again. But she proved them wrong and by working hard with physical therapy, within six months she was back on her feet, though she still limps today.Ruth also found a better psychiatrist, who took the time to talk to her, as well as involve her family to get to the bottom of what triggered her episodes.‘He was very thorough, he went over my whole background, and included my family in the process. He helped me to organise a support system which is so essential for mental illness,’ explains Ruth. ‘Also, the medication improved over time.’ Realising how ineffective her original psychiatrist had been, Ruth sued him in  for mismanaging her case, and eventually received an out of court settlement. Happily, Ruth’s le was on the up.After the accident she turned her hand to painting, which was more of a passion than architecture had been. She found immersing herself in her art a soothing form of self-expression. In February , she met Richard, two years her senior, through a dating service. ‘After our first date I had a mini episode, so on the second date I barely spoke a word and assumed I’d never hear from him again. When he asked me on a third date I couldn’t believe it. aposBut it was time to open up. I told him everything about the seriousness of my condition. He couldn’t believe my honesty, but he was studying to be a psychiatrist so he understood.’They wed just four months later, and went on to have two children, Douglas, now , and Elizabeth, now . ‘Even when they were teens they never got into using drugs, I think they were very wary, funnily enough!’Between  and  Ruth only had four breakdowns. ‘I always tell my husband I made him a great psychiatrist as he actually lived through my experiences with me. And since  I haven’t had any episodes, thanks to finding the right drug and dosage, and my lestyle. I have formed close friendships which are much healthier.’ Ruth is also now a successful painter. ‘Painting has given me a purpose in le but it’s also been an outlet for my imagination, as has writing fiction, which is very therapeutic. I just take it one day at a time, but I am finally at a place in my le now where I can live normally.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"bosses four gas companies pocketed","story":"NewsBosses of four gas companies pocketed £ million before axing , staffEXCLUSIVE: Many remaining staff at Centrica were told they would be given new contracts with more hours and less pay after coronavirus pandemic plummetShareCommentsBySunday PeopleChris McLaughlin:,  AUG NewsGas company top directors are under scrutiny after taking £ million \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The aposwatch listapos has been revealed the day after Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a local lockdown will be rolled out in parts of Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire following a spike in Covid- cases. As many as four million people will no longer be allowed to meet friends and family from other households in private homes, gardens or public spaces.  In a further blow on Friday Boris Johnson said plans to restart wedding receptions have been scrapped and new face covering rules are coming in as part of the Governmentaposs latest lockdown changes in England.With very little notice he declared face coverings would be compulsory in more indoor settings including cinemas and churches. He postponed reopening of more settings including ice rinks, casinos and bowling alleys for another fortnight, along with wedding receptions of more than  people.  The Prime Minister also shelved reopening close-contact services - meaning beauty treatments like brows and facials that were due to restart on Saturday must be cancelled. Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned the UK had potentially aposreached the limitapos of how much society could reopen, as infections rise once again.

The overjoyed couple’s seven-year search for happiness is over at last as they settle into le with their treasured baby. The two week old is the ultimate rainbow baby, one bringing hope after the storm of previous loss. Jon and Jennie’s journey to parenthood has been long and full of  hope, tears and heartbreak. Over seven years they have had  pregnancy tests, five IVF cycles, a cancer scare, a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy. Now they are looking forward to things most parents hate. Jennie said: “She keeps us up at night, which I love! I can’t wait for sleepless nights, they’ll be a privilege.” As he cradled Sophia, Jon, , admitted there at times they nearly lost hope but a last-ditch round of IVF at a private clinic in Greece finally brought them happiness.  And the couple’s story, which Jon shared on Twitter, has brought hope to thousands of other parents struggling to conceive.It has been shared more than , times and most of the ,-plus people who left ­messages are ­parents who also ­battled to have a child. Jon said: “I only have a  followers so thought I’d get a few nice messages from friends but it’s gone crazy. We just wanted to let other people know there is hope no matter how hard it is. “Jennie and I got really emotional reading all the heartwarming stories of people and their own rainbow babies. I’ve also had about  people messaging me for advice. It’s nice to be able to give something back.”  Occupational therapist Jennie, , said: “I had got to the stage where I felt I couldn’t take any more, physically or emotionally. But the first time I held Sophia, all that stress just melted away. She was worth every second of the wait.” Sophia means wisdom in Greek and Jennie believes her name fits her perfectly. Jennie said: “There were points when I felt it was ­madness to carry on with our dream. But from somewhere we found the wisdom to keep trying.” The couple, from Wirral, met  years ago. They were on opposing teams at their local pub quiz and romance blossomed after trainee solicitor Jon began secretly texting Jennie the answers. He proposed in  but later that year Jennie, who had appendicitis as a child, started getting abdominal pain. Tests showed she had adhesions and scarring around her fallopian tubes.  She said: “The consultant said there was a small chance I might struggle to conceive but he was very positive. He also said I would be perfect for IVF and so I didn’t see it as a big concern.” They couple married the following September  and were hoping to conceive on their honeymoon in Mexico. But it was the beginning of an emotional rollercoaster. Jennie said: “We just thought it would happen, like it does for everyone.” But the months passed and nothing happened. In , a routine smear showed pre-cancerous cells on Jennie’s cervix and she had treatment to remove the ­affected area. After she recovered, they continued trying for a baby.  By  they had to admit there were problems. Jon said: “We had a ­reoccurring scene every month of Jen coming out of the bathroom, shaking her head and it was heartbreaking. “It felt like we were losing a baby, every month.” They were referred for IVF but tests showed Jennie’s tubes were clear – meaning their fertility problems lay where. Their first IVF cycle, in September , failed.  They stayed upbeat and full of hope but when all three cycles allowed on the NHS failed it was a big blow. When Jon’s sister Jenny got pregnant it was tough for the couple. He said: “Of course, we were happy for her but we couldn’t help feeling envious and that was a horrible way to feel.” People were very supportive, Jennie’s friend offered to donate eggs, her cousin was willing to be a surrogate and they considered adoption. Jennie enrolled at a private fertility clinic in Greece in  but that March got pregnant naturally.  She flew to Greece to be monitored but four days on she miscarried. Jon said: “It was heartbreaking. For four glorious days we’d been expectant parents. The miscarriage really crushed us. It was worse that I was working at home in the UK and Jennie was in Greece.” The following month Jennie was rushed to hospital with an ectopic pregnancy. She had been carrying a second baby.

As restrictions ease, the Very Big Family Le Survey gives a glimpse of how le has changed over the past few months and how families view the “new normal”. The good news is that two thirds of parents of teenagers say all that time spent together at home has had a positive effect on their family. And the same applies to almost three quarters of those with kids under . Many families have created perfect memories by doing new activities together, such as playing board games, baking, walking and cycling.  Watching TV and streaming services have also provided family bonding time. Very asked parents to reflect on the past few months as they prepare for their children toto school full time. While for some it was stressful, juggling work, home schooling and quality time with the family, others found it fun and inspiring. Writer Gemma Cheetham lives with husband Mike and their two children, Ava-Violet, six, and Gabriel, one . She says the lockdown has made it feel like things have slowed down. She explained: For the first few weeks of lockdown I was working from home, and it was a struggle as Gabriel wanted to be with me all the time.  I’d end up logging on to work early in the morning, stopping at pm and starting again in the evening to make up lost hours. Normally, Mike would have taken the kids out, but when the restrictions came in he couldn’t do that. Then I got furloughed, and at first I enjoyed home schooling Ava-Violet and doing practical things like planting in the garden and baking banana bread.  But I started to notice a real dference in her. She just wanted to stay in the house. Even though we reassured her, she’d say things like, ‘I don’t want to go back to school, I want to stay safe and I want my family to stay safe.’ When her village school reopened, and she was in a small class bubble, she went back to her old self straightaway. She was glad to have the routine again, but she still likes having me at home. I feel like le has slowed down and we’ve been able to just appreciate each other’s company more. Another family feeling the benefit of spending more time together are the Blankstones. Mum Lisa and dad Mark live with daughter Olivia,  .  Estate agent Lisa told us: Olivia was due to sit her GCSEs and obviously she was upset when they were cancelled but since then she’s enjoyed being able to just chill out. I was furloughed, and Mark has his own optician’s which closed temporarily, so we were all at home. Olivia had schoolwork at first, but that eased off so we had lots of free time. We walked every day, exercised at home doing Joe Wicks and David Lloyd sessions. Olivia kept in touch with friends via video chats, and although she said a few times she wished she could see them properly, she was fine. She was disappointed to have our holiday cancelled, but she’s going to college and she’ll be more than ready to have some normality back again by September. We all get on well, so the biggest challenge for us was not being able to see other members of the family. Because he runs his own business, Mark said he’s never spent so much time with Olivia and he’s loved that. When you’re busy you feel like you’re always chasing your tail, but lockdown meant we all had more time.

Andy Calvert has been in the same spot outside a house in Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, occupied by Cameron Weir, , and his mum Sheila, . Cameron and Sheila claim a wood burner used by the -year-old ex-soldier causes fumes to pour into their house and back garden. It was originally thought that the council was powerless to intervene because the van sat on an unadopted road, reports the Daily Record. The family have now been informed by the local authority that it does own the land. However, officials say due to  Covid- restrictions  they can’t monitor the site to determineAndy is causing a nuisance. Cameron said: “For so long we were told it was an unadopted road that the council didn’t own. “The council have finally admitted that it is theirs and they have the authority to move Andy. “Then we were told they couldn’t act because of the  Covid restrictions  – but they could have acted long before now. “It’s incredibly frustrating.” Andy, who has been parked in his spot since August , blamed the council for his  housing issues  and said he would not be moving. He added: “This started when the council evicted me from my flat because I fell behind on rent.I had nowhere to go but my van.  “I have nothing against Cameron or Sheila. “ButI take a flat the council offer, I’ll be back to square one with all the outstanding arrears from the last flat to pay.So until the council can offer me help, I’m not going anywhere.” Long-distance lorry driver Andy has kitted out his van with a double bed, a TV, a fridge and wood ling for insulation. He uses a gas ring to cook, has a chemical toilet and showers at work. Andy admitted the wood burner he bought for £ from eBay was “smokey at first” but claims it is better now."},{"url":null,"title":"grans manicure saved life after","story":"NewsGrans manicure saved her le after technician spotted lung cancer from her nailsJoan Martindale, , has thanked her nail technician who advised her to seek medical help after noticing her nails had began to bend over and recognised it as a possible health scareShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  AUG NewsJoan with her daughter Lindsay Edwards \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Joan Martindale had noticed her fingernails and toenails were getting wider and starting to curve earlier this year, and despite Googling the symptoms that hinted it could be a sign of heart or lung disease, she brushed off the concerns. But when the -year-old visited her manicurist of ten years Linda Bartram, the technician noticed the change in her clientaposs nails and urged her to get it checked out. Retired craft shop assistant Joan took the advice and doctors quickly diagnosed her with squamous cell carcinoma, carrying out a five-hour operation to remove a mm tumour from her lung. Joan, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy, shared her story to raise awareness of the symptom which could help with early diagnosis. Going for a manicure saved my le, said Joan, from Tutbury, Staffordshire. It was incredible she could pick it up from just looking at my nails. Iaposve told her I shall be eternally grateful to her, when weaposve got rid of this COVID weaposre going for a big slap-up meal. Joan, who previously smoked   cigarettes a day before switching to vaping in , first experienced unusual symptoms around Christmas, when her ankles and feet began to swell. I went to the doctors and they said it was water retention, they gave me some tablets but they didnapost do anything. Then I noticed my toenails got wide and bulbous on my big toes. I donapost usually look on Google but I was curious and it said it could be something to do with heart or lung cancer.Touch wood, for my age, the doctors have said Iaposm in good health so I did think aposoh no itaposs not me, Iaposll wait a little bit longerapos. Then when I went to have my nails done in March Linda askedI was alright. I mentioned the swelling in my ankles and then she said she didnapost want to upset me, but that she thought there was something wrong with my nails and that they needed to be looked at by a doctor. After her appointment with a GP led to a series of scans, Joan discovered she had a tumour on the top right lobe of one of her lungs.  Glenfield Hospital in Leicester carried out an operation to remove the tumour and Joan also had lymph nodes removed that came back clear, which she hopes is a sign the cancer hasnapost spread further.The gran-of-two says despite the scary diagnosis she feels lucky it was caught and treated, especially during the coronavirus lockdown.Joan said: Iaposve got such a positive attitude and I kept thinking aposIaposve got to go through all this because I want to see my grandchildren grow upapos. Iaposve always been an optimist and just keep thinking Iaposve been so lucky for it to be diagnosed and all sorted so quickly. It was a bit rough lying for five hours on my side with my arms stretched above my head, but the surgeon and the team were absolutely brilliant.  Iaposm just keeping my fingers crossed now that itaposs gone away. I havenapost vaped since the operation. She added that she may have gone to the doctors to discuss the change in her nails at some point, but credited Linda for raising it as a real red flag. This symptom needs to be known about so conditions can be diagnosed early - the more people know about it the better, she added. Beauty therapist and nail technician Linda Bartram said she was shocked by the change in Joanaposs nails in the course of a month. She said: At Joanaposs previous appointment I had noticed her nails were starting to just slightly bend over.

A close pal of Christian Brueckner, , claims the German told him he had stripped naked outside first – and only fled when one of the teens woke up in terror and started to wake the others. The friend broke his silence about the alleged incident after seeing this week’s police searches. Dozens of officers descended on an allotment Brueckner used to rent in Hanover on Tuesday.They excavated the site, using snfer dogs, ground penetrating radar and drones.  They apparently found a cellar under a stone slab and took away the concrete foundations of his old shack in skips. Brueckner is in a German jail suspected of kidnapping three-year-old Madeleine from a holiday flat in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in May .He lived in the area then. His lawyer dismissed the searches as “pure desperation”. His friend said: “We never thought his crimes involved children – he was a kleptomaniac. We just thought he stole everything in sight. “He told me what he got up to when he lived in Portugal. He said he had been surviving by breaking into hotel rooms, stealing cameras and laptops. “But the strangest thing he ever told me was about breaking into a room where four teenagers from Britain were sleeping on the sofa and floor. “He was naked and had left his clothes outside and he was masturbating. When one woke up and tried to wake the others up he panicked and ran out. “He said he ran naked through the town. He told it like a funny story.” The pal said he didn’t know for certainthis happened in Praia da Luz – but he believes it was in the same area. He told how he befriended Brueckner at a kiosk the German owned in Braunschweig, North Germany, in .“We used to drink in a back room. He talked about his crimes and was kind of proud about it.” The friend said that Brueckner claimed he stole £, from a house where the large deposit for a property sale was being stashed. He claims Brueckner boasted of using the money to buy a house in Baia, where he lived as a child, and the kiosk. “It was all thefts, burglaries and drugs he talked about. He never mentioned children,” said the pal. “He even claimed the palm trees in his garden were stolen. There was not one day when he didn’t steal something.” The friend said the German claimed he also used some of his £, haul to buy a disused factory in East Germany at an auction.  Earlier this year police are said to have searched the grounds and found eight USB sticks in a bag, some containing child abuse images. Brueckner ended up living at the Braunschweig garden allotment between  and .Sabine Sellag, the owner of his former shack and plot, fears she may have been sleeping above the body of another missing child known as the ‘German Maddie’.Brueckner was quizzed but never charged after Inga Gehricke, five, vanished in  near where he lived.Locals said he prised open floorboards in the shack soon after arriving to gain access to an underground cellar.  He was one of around six people living on one of the  plots, which is forbidden.“A few homeless people live there but they get away with it because it helps with security,” the pal said. “He was friendly to people. I think he was lonely deep down.”But after three years he was on the move again after police started to quiz him about missing Inga and accessing web porn. “I think he went back to Portugal, I never saw him again,” said the friend. “He sold everything he had. He bought a car to leave with.” "},{"url":null,"title":"manchester revellers slam governments new","story":"NewsManchester revellers baffled by Governments new lockdown adviceThe Sunday Mirror found pubs and restaurants in the city centre were bustling – but customers said they were not sure what they could and could not doShareCommentsByLaura Connor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsMolly Mayston and her friend Nicole Casseldon arent impressed with the Governments handling of the lockdown changes \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The announcement that two households can no longer meet up in the region was rushed through with just a few hours’ notice on Thursday, leaving residents worried and confused. Pubs and restaurants in the city centre were bustling on Friday night – but customers said they were not sure what they could and could not do. Enjoying a drink in the trendy Northern Quarter, Nicole Casseldon, , said: “The Government has failed to make anything clear. It’s really busy here but we can’t meet our family or friends at home or in the garden. It doesn’t make any sense.” Her friend Molly Mayston, also , added: “We have spent months and months at home being careful. This latest advice is all over the place.” Anyone ignoring the latest rules could face a £ fine. But Stephen Wade, , travelled from Keighley, West Yorks – another area hit by the changes – to enjoy a weekend with a pal in Manchester.

Tom Jnr added: “He will fight and pursue the avenues needed to see Archie. They’re not the only ones who can launch a court case. He’d love to hold that little boy one time.” He said Harry, , has gone “from the British Army and Royal Family to changing diapers at a multi-million dollar property thousands of miles from his family while being told what to say and do by Meghan.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle kate bickered much","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Kate bickered so much Queen driven in to stop it author claimsThe Queen was driven from Buckingham Palace to Kensington Palace to make peace between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton, royal author Tom Quinn saysShareCommentsByLaura Sharman:,  AUG NewsMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Suggestions of a rt between the sisters-in-law have been covered in a number of books on the younger royals, though with dfering accounts.In Kensington Palace aposAn Intimate Memoir from Queen Mary to Meghan Markle apos, Quinn writes: At first the couples got on well – William and Harry have always been close – but inevitably there were tensions.As one insider explains, aposboth William and Harry were always likely to be drawn to confident, strong women because they lost their mother so early. The insider continues:was very warm towards Meghan when she arrived. But tensions were bound to arise because Meghan inevitably had to accept that that although she is a Duchess she is not married to the next king. I think she has found that dficult to deal with and although Harry loved their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace, Meghan and conscious that it was tiny in comparison to the vast apartment complex where Kate and William live.  Harry has nothing to prove. Meghan has everything to prove. Thataposs the problem. I know, for example, that tensions reached such a pitch that the Queen herself was driven to Kensington from Buckingham Palace to try to stop the bickering. However others have suggested Meghan and Kate werenapost duelling but just had nothing in common. Authors of the Meghan and Harry biography Finding Freedom claim there was no feud between the pair and rubbished claims that Kate was left in tears after one incident.  Its writers claim Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not. The alleged rt between the two couples stemmed from a growing coolness between Harry and William and not Meghan and Kate, according to co-authors Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie. They say the press were too quick to blame Meghan and Harryaposs decision to move to Windsor on the duelling duchesses when it was Harry who felt suffocated by his brother. The authors wrote: The truth was that Meghan and Kate just didnapost know each other that well.

And she finally hit the jackpot when she landed her big break as paralegal Rachel Zane in hit US legal drama, Suits.So when she and Prince Harry went on their first secret date at Soho House’s Dean Street Townhouse - where she sipped martinis and he drank beer - she was already quite a wealthy woman.But the Duchess of Sussex hasnapost always been accustomed to dating princes and mingling with A-Listers such as Serena Williams and Amal Clooney. In fact she has had her fair share of normal jobs to make ends meet. One of her more under the radar jobs was for singer Robin Thicke. The star and his now ex-we Paula Patton hired Meghan to do their invitations. Meghan at the time was working as a freelance calligrapher and her enviable skills meant she wrote all the invitations to the coupleaposs wedding. Speaking to Esquire in , she said: “I went to an all-girls Catholic school for like six years during the time when kids actually had handwriting class. “I’ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well. What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning. “I didn’t wait tables. I did calligraphy for the invitations for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton’s wedding.” She added: It was great [income] while I was auditioning. Meghan also hosted two-hour calligraphy classes at a stationary store. Winnie Park, CEO of Paper Source where Meghan taught, told People: She taught calligraphy, and hosted a group of customers and instructed them during a two-hour class on how to do calligraphy.  It was her part-time job as she was going through auditions. Winnie said Meghan also led classes on gt-wrapping and book-binding. Meanwhile, Meghanaposs first job came about when she was just . She sold frozen yogurt at a shop called Humphrey Yogart in Calornia. Her former boss, Paula Sheftel, said: She earned minimum wage and was very popular with customers. She had to prove she had an outgoing personality and would work well with staff.  Meghan deleted all her social media accounts before she married Harry. But she had tweeted that she had met one of her idols Baywatch actress Yasmine Bleeth in the parking lot of the frozen yogurt shop. She said she said to her: Oh my God, I loved you in that Soft  Dri commercial to which Yasmine replied: OK, thank you! Meghanaposs other film roles include having a part in the  film A Lot Like Love with Ashton Kutcher. She had a short scene and was just called hot girl in the credits.  MONEY reported she was only supposed to say hi but she convinced the director to give her five lines. In her quest to become a successful actress Meghan also worked on a game show where she modelled briefcases in . She joined the game show Deal or No Deal and became part of a group of women whose job was to wear matching outfits and hold the numbered cases. The contestants had to guess which suitcase might contain  million . A colleague said she made an episode but she didnapost like the job.  Meghan told Esquire that the role was uncomfortable as she was standing up there forever in these terribly uncomfortable and inexpensive five-inch heels just waiting for someone to pick my number so I could go and sit down. Like many thespians who seek a big break Meghan worked as a waitress She told Vanity Fair is one of those things that actors do. However very little is known about where she worked and whether she enjoyed serving diners. Meghan also starred in a commercials for Tostitos in .

Andrew’s mum Debbie Adlam and Harry’s mum Charlotte Charles are both fighting for justice for their sons killed just  days apart. On Friday three young men who dragged Andrew, , to his death were jailed for a total of  years. Harry, , died on August  when his motorbike collided with a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, we of a US intelligence officer stationed at RAF Croughton, Northants. Sacoolas left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity and is yet to face a court.  The bond between the woman, who live near each other, was forged through Facebook and then Debbie attended a protest for Harry.Dunn family’s spokesman Radd Sieger said: “Theyaposve both found support from each other, which is a great thing. “You do need to get justice before you can get any closure, so this is very important to them. “I think people like Debbie and Charlotte have a lot to teach us about how to cope with adversity. They’ve carried ­themselves with such strength and dignity I think both are incredible.” Andrew was killed just four weeks after his wedding, dragged for a mile by a getaway car after getting ensnared in a tow rope.  Driver Henry Long, , Albert Bowers, , and Jessie Cole, , were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of murder. Mrs Adlam said she struggled with the verdict and hoped the Attorney General could do more. She said: “We feel and thousands have told us they also feel we do not have the justice Andrew deserves.  “I am reeling with how much was reduced for age reasons. If you can marry at , why at  do you not serve what you would serve at . It is incomprehensible to me. I think this needs looking at.” Mr Sieger is now advising Mrs Adlam about fighting to change the law, as Harry’s family did by successfully lobbying the Government so no one  could use diplomatic immunity to escape justice.

The reprimand is said to have happened after the Queenaposs dresser and adviser Angela Kelly did not meet Meghanaposs sudden demand to visit Buckingham Palace and try on a tiara that the couple had chosen for their wedding,  due to royal protocol. A new biography of Harry and Meghan accuses the Queenaposs adviser of deliberately dragging her feet when the Duchess of Sussex asked to have access to the tiara ahead of their wedding in May . According to the authors of Finding Freedom, Harry felt that some of the old guard at Buckingham Palace simply didnapost like Meghan and would stop at nothing to make her le dficult.

The paper goes on to claim the prince used rude language about Ms Kelly after she pointed out that an appointment must be booked in advance to access the Queenaposs jewels. The Queenaposs adviser alerted Her Majesty when she learnt of Harryaposs bad language, prompting the monarch to call him for a private meeting.

After four months in lockdown, cooking, cleaning, washing and ironing, home-schooling two kids while trying to work and run a business, with my husband also working from home... I was on my knees. I came out of lockdown looking and feeling like a battered old woman. So off I went. I believe that unless I look after my own health first and am firing on all cylinders with an energised and positive frame of mind, I’m actually not in a good place to look after my family’s needs. When I take a moment to compare my mum’s le to mine, I wonder how she managed to do all that, keep sane and carry on  She had an arranged marriage, met my dad literally on her wedding day, left her home, family, friends and everything she knew to come to the UK with my dad to make a new le for herself. Once here, she had four kids under the age of five to look after and then worked. She cooked, cleaned, entertained day in and day out. And the only me-time she ever got was curling up on the sofa after all the chores were done with a cup of tea and a biscuit in front of Dallas. We all flew the nest and then my dad died in his s. She was left on her own without having a clue how to take care of her own needs. She was lonely and wasn’t used to having a purpose outside of taking care of her family. It was this experience that made me promise myself that taking time out, away from my kids and hubby, and have time to just check in with myself was important. I also want to ensure that no matter what age I am, I have the confidence to meet new people, make friends and be adventurous – because by doing that you have less chance of being lonely in later le.

Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on Saturday that the Gamaleya Institute, a state research facility in Moscow, had completed clinical trials of the vaccine and paperwork is being prepared to register it. He said doctors and teachers would be the first to be vaccinated, and added: We plan wider vaccinations for October.  Russiaaposs first potential COVID- vaccine would secure local regulatory approval in August and be administered to health workers soon thereafter.  Yet the speed at which Russia is moving to roll it out has prompted some Western media to question whether Moscow is putting national prestige before science and safety. The head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, has likened what he said was Russiaaposs success in developing a vaccine to the Soviet Unionaposs  launch of Sputnik , the worldaposs first satellite. Britain takes a similar view to the US in being sceptical of the Russian vaccine and is unlikely to be ordering it in for use here, thereports.  One source said: “We would use a vaccinewe trusted the data.” Crucially, it depended on how open the Russians or Chinese were, the source said. Russia has released no scientic data proving the vaccine’s safety or efficacy while details of the British vaccine being tested have already been published in The Lancet. Public health experts say it would be impossible for Britain to accept a vaccine from another country without all internationally recognised protocols being met.

People living on Delphside Road in Greater Manchester are not longer allowed to host friends and family at home under new local lockdown rules.While their neighbours, living on the same street and just metres away, can continue to enjoy an eased lockdown on the West Lancashire side, reports the Manchester Evening News.Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced the local lockdown in parts of Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and West Yorkshire on Friday after a spike in coronavirus cases.As many as four million people will be affected and no longer allowed to meet people from other households in private homes, gardens or public spaces. Dave Higham, who lives on Delphside Road, is still able to host guests at home yet his next-door-neighbour David Welsby cannot. An underground culvert runs between their homes in Orrell and marks the border between Greater Manchester and Lancashire. Dave, who lives on the Lancashire side, said: Itaposs strange that we can carry on and they canapost. In a way I feel relieved I live where I live because Iaposm going away to Cornwall tomorrow with my partner. Iaposm not going to take the Mickey out of them but Iaposm not sure what they will all think when I roll up in my caravan in the morning.  Meanwhile next-door-neighbour David and his we Wendy, who have a Greater Manchester address, had to cancel a visit from their granddaughters due to the new local lockdown. Since March the pair have been shielding, due to Wendyaposs illness, but relatives were able to visit them in their garden at a distance. David, a -year-old retired builder, said: My granddaughters were supposed to be coming for tea today. We have had to cancel which is a shame.  We havenapost been going out much anyway and I get my shopping delivered by my son. At the end of the day, it is just up to you to be sensible. I would not like to give the virus to anybody. We just have to knuckle down and get on with this. Neighbours Ray and Eileen Cook, who live across the road, are also under local lockdown and said the situation is silly.  Ray, , said: I donapost think it will make much dference. The people who want to go out will go out anyway. Resident Cath Martland, who was born and bred in Wigan, is not facing the restrictions while her friends and family are. She said: It doesnapost make a lot of sense. I suppose there has to be a line somewhere and we just fall on the right side of that.

A manuscript written by Virginia Giuffre says the Duke had “a really good time” and that she gave him “numerous massages”. Ms Giuffre – who was  or  at the time – says she was later rewarded with “close to a thousand dollars” by convicted paedophile Epstein. The sensational claims emerged in a tranche of newly-released court papers which Epstein’s former lover Ghislaine Maxwell, , tried to block. Describing her time with Andrew at Epstein’s ,-acre Zorro ranch near Sante Fe, New Mexico, Ms Giuffre writes: “My job was to entertain him endlessly, whether that meant having to bestow him my body during an erotic massage or simply take him horseback riding. The mansion was completely empty save a couple of maids who also cooked our dinners for us, and a couple of bodyguards that we hardly even saw at all.” She claims Maxwell – a longtime pal of Andrew,  – arranged for her to go to the ranch, around , but did not tell her who would be there. “Ghislaine only told me that I was to meet someone there, not sure of whom that was. It wasn’t my place to ask,” Ms Giuffre claims. When she arrived at the ranch she saw Andrew who, she says, greeted her with the “same old cheesy grin” she had seen when they met up previously in London and New York. Unlike the Prince’s other visits to Epstein’s homes, the American financier and Maxwell were not present. Ms Giuffre says after two days with Andrew, she was recalled to New York to debrief Epstein and Maxwell. She says that during a conversation in the tycoon’s kitchen Maxwell asked: “So… how was the ranch with the Prince ” Ms Giuffre, now  and a mum of three living in Australia, says she replied: “I think he had a really good time, he seemed relaxed and when we said goodbye he gave me a kiss. “I took him horse-riding, just around the property, we went swimming in the pool and, of course, I gave him plenty of massages. He had a massage at least couple of times each day, really seeming to enjoy his time there.” Describing the reaction of Epstein and his lover Maxwell, she adds: “Like proud parents, they looked me with such content. ‘Good, you did really well,’ Jeffrey complimented me.” She says Epstein gave her “close to a thousand dollars… more than what I thought anybody at my young age could make for a couple of days work”.  During the Prince’s interview with BBC Newsnight last November, he was at pains to suggest he was never alone while at Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida and the Caribbean. But he was not asked about visiting Zorro.A former ranch hand told the Sunday Mirror he saw Andrew a couple of times but never “without Jeffrey or Ghislaine”. The new claims heap more pressure on the politan Police to release logs kept by royal protection officers.One former royal bodyguard, Paul Page, has said notes would include times and dates of trips the Prince took. Logs are kept for  years. Forty-seven court documents were unsealed by New York Judge Loretta Preska on Thursday.They relate to a  civil case between Maxwell and Ms Giuffre. A second wave of papers could be released – subject to an appeal scheduled for next month.  It was in a  affidavit that Ms Giuffre – referred to as Jane Doe  – claimed she had sex with Andrew in Maxwell’s Belgravia home, Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse and at an orgy on the tycoon’s Caribbean island.Her claims were struck out of the civil case by Florida judge Kenneth Marra. He ruled: “The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in sexual activities are immaterial and impertinent to this central claim , especially considering that these details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government. These unnecessary details shall be stricken.” In other claims reported yesterday, Ms Giuffre alleges Andrew had “an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls” at Epstein’s Caribbean home – and Maxwell had “continuous” sex with girls and women. Maxwell was arrested in New Hampshire last month on suspicion of grooming and abusing three girls under the age of . She is also accused of perjury and faces up to  yearsconvicted.She has pleaded not guilty and is due for trial in New York in July . Andrew and his legal team have vehemently denied Ms Giuffre’s claims.A picture shows them together but the Prince said in his Newsnight appearance that he does not recall ever meeting her.Epstein, , killed himself in jail last year while awaiting sex-trafficking charges.Andrew was pictured walking with the tycoon in New York’s Central Park in , just months after the paedophile was released from prison for procuring a minor for prostitution.

Some of the centres claim sonar ­signals “activate brain cells”children touch heads with the mammals. Staff at one waterpark visited by the Sunday People even claimed children unable to speak had uttered their first words after contact with dolphins. Dozens of other parks offer services online – some claiming therapy can beat cancer and aid people with Down’s syndrome, cerebral palsy and post-traumatic stress disorder. The centres, which also host cruel dolphin shows, charge people up to £,, assuring parents that their child will see signicant benefits. But experts accuse them of offering  hope. Prof Richard Mills, a consultant for AT-Autism and former research ­director at the National Autistic Society, said: “It’s exploiting people to spend a lot of money on something where there is no ­evidence of any benefits.” We visited three parks in or near Antalya – Aksu Dolphinarium, Dolphinland and Dolphin Park Kemer. Aksu said British people “come more and more”.  Kemer said many come from the UK. Dolphinland told us “not so many English” people come. All three parks claimed potential benefits for autistic people. To examine the claims we took autism awareness campaigner Emma Dalmayne, , and her autistic children Damien, , and Skylar, seven. Emma, who is also autistic, was horried when she saw a ­therapy session at Dolphinland. She said: “Don’t waste your money, it’s a scam.”  Emma was told by Aksu staff that her children would only show benefits six months later – at which point she should buy another ten-day course for £, per child to maintain progress. One therapist bragged how staff would coax her kids to swim evendistressed, adding: “Evenhe cries, it’s normal for him to cry.” Emma said: “When I heard them talking about my child’s brain it was horrying. “It’s yet ­another scam to fleece naive parents who are wasting thousands that could be spent on a more beneficial pastime that would give the­ ­children tools to cope in the world.”  None of the centres we spoke to guaranteed ­improvement or a cure. But all three said there were long-term ­benefits for ­autism and ­tried to sell Emma ten sessions. Aksu staff said: “It cannot heal but it can make it better. It’s not a cure, it’s just a ­treatment but you can make it better and dolphin therapy makes it better.” A rep showed images of children touching heads with the mammals to exchange “waves”. He said: “Electromagnetic waves help activate the brain of children. In some cases they can lose symptoms.” A therapist at Dolphinland told us the animals have “signals and ­vibrations” and “they send these signals everywhere”. She claimed: “For the kids with autism it helps so much. We have the kids that come every year and they’re better every year. “If they don’t speak, for example, they start talking after therapy. Yes!”  Emma says Damien and Skylar have sensory issues which can lead to ­“flapping, gritting of teeth, spinning and repeating things to calm down”. When she askedthese symptoms could be helped by dolphins, the ­therapist at Dolphinland said: “Yes of course” – adding that the children could lose “some of the bad energy”. Asked outrightit would “heal” a lot of her children’s behaviours, Emma was told: “We hope so. Not all the kids are better. But you may try.”  We saw a session at Dolphinland, where the creatures are also made to perform tricks like throwing balls and catching hoops in shows. Twin girls aged four spent  minutes with two “therapists” and two dolphins in their  x  metre pool. One child screamed and cried as the dolphins rolled over so the girls could stroke them. Their mother, from Craiova, Romania, said they were on day seven of ten and admitted her twins were “afraid” of the animals. She said: “We need to wait six months but we are coming in August again.” Watching the therapy session left Emma distressed. The mum of six, from Plumstead, South London, said: “It was heartbreaking to see ­animals in pools with ­children screaming and crying. It’s cruelty mixed with fake ­therapy. My children’s reactions were horror, anger and sadness for the children we saw. “I had to leave and cry. My son asked, why are they doing this  He’s very upset.”  When askedDolphin Park Kemer practitioners were medically trained and ­experienced with autism, the rep there said: “He’s experienced in making therapy, in how to stand in the water and play with the dolphin. “It’s for the nervous system. Therapists stay in the water with the child... when you put your head underwater you can hear the signal. Honestly you don’t need a doctor. I can say this. This is something ­alternative for the child.” When Emma askedtherapy could stop her ­children “flapping and making noises” he replied “yes”, before adding: “I ­cannot guarantee you will see these effects, nobody can say this.” Asked againit is a “good treatment for ­autism”, he insisted: “Yes, yes, yes.”  Prof Mills said: “Dolphin therapy promotes a narrative that autism can be cured.

However, it’s also a chance to lay down a marker.Grab a positive result there and the Dark Blues head into two home games on the bounce with Morton and newly-promoted Raith Rovers coming to town before the end of October – an opportunity to get off to a flying start.On the back of a trip to face Ayr, Dundee play Dick Campbell’s Arbroath at Dens before a Highlands clash with Inverness and then facing a Dunfermline side that has strengthened well over the past few weeks.After a Boxing Day trip to Dumfries, it’s the only midweek fixture of the campaign – home to Alloa – four days before hosting Hearts in what’s likely to be one of the biggest matches of the calendar for the Dens men.With only  of the  matches before the turn of the year, getting  off to a strong start will be essential to any promotion bid.That’s where the fixture list looks to be in Dundee’s favour – successive home games against the Jambos, Ayr and Inverness with trips to Raith and Arbroath in between.That run from the start of the year through to March’sto Tynecastle will be the key to success for James McPake and his men before heading into the final eight matches.The Dark Blues won’t be too happy with the card they’ve been dealt by the SPFL but defiance in the face of adversity is a trait at Dens Park.And come the final day on a Friday night at Queen of the South, the players will still fancy they can finish up on top and get the club back to the big time – eventhey have to do it the hard way.A full fixture list can be found here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Aberdeen, too, have their AberDNA setup and we wondered why Dundee didn’t have a similar thing.“It was a no-brainer when you think about it.“I put the proposal together initially going through DFCSS but then I took it to the club and they really liked the idea.”The levels of monthly subscription y from £, £, £ and £ with all money going directly to the club.In , members get rewards including pin badges, scarves, t-shirts, signed Dundee tops and hospitality.Ross, though, is keen for the idea to evolve as the Foundation grows and is looking for input from more fans.“I think the idea will change and grow over time,” he says.“In the current situation, it was a case of getting it out right away rather than having the perfect product because we all know the appetite is there to help the club.“The feedback so far has been very positive and that’s not always the case with these things! A lot of people are saying it’s exactly what the club has needed for a while.“It’s a way to keep money coming into the club and it might go on to pay for two players a yearit all develops and builds.”He added: “There are lots of dferent fan groups and factions and I wanted to launch the Foundation with the Supporters’ Society, the DSA, the Historical Trust and everybody involved.“We want to get fans on board and involved. Things are tough right now and I think back to the Deefiant season with the togetherness in the stands. We could do with more of that.”Ross has been helped out by fellow supporter Scott Roberts, with both taking on the role of foundation ambassadors as well as by staff at Dens Park.Previously he was pivotal in setting up DeeTV and is happy to be working with the club again with the hope the foundation can bring the club and fans closer.Ross said: “I think being associated with the club gives it that legitimacy for fans and has helped a lot.“Tommy Young and Jonny McInally at the club have been very helpful in giving advice on the infrastructure and how it will all work.“It’s dficult with the current situation but we’re talking about doing a proper launch for it because we are concerned it has only been on social media really so far and that only reaches a certain audience. Unfortunately, we can’t be going to games at Dens to convince people to join.“Overall, I think I’d like to see better communication between the club and fans. I think this is a way we could achieve that. It’s something that’s been missing for some time. There will also be a steady income stream for club as well but, hopefully, we can improve the communication because, to me, that is the key to success.“It’s important that people get value for money and that it’s worth signing up for. At the moment it’s very much – you get to this level of donation, you get this reward. I know a lot of people might not be interested in getting a pin badge or whatever but the plan is for the Foundation to change over time.”Happy MonDees member Scott deserves huge credit for his own fundraising efforts for the club after setting up a GoFundMe in order to ‘Support the Dee’ and have next season’s shirt adorned with a ‘Thank You to the NHS’ badge on the sleeve.To date, this has raised £, for the club with a percentage being donated to Roxburghe House.He said: “I had been looking online at all the efforts done by fans of other clubs like Raith Rovers, Dunfermline, Partick Thistle and Hearts was a big one. It was all great work done and it didn’t appear like much was happening to put money into Dundee at the time.“I didn’t know much about GoFundMe and one of my mates suggested I just start it up.“It was around the time when we were all clapping on Thursday nights for the NHS workers and I thought of all the fantastic efforts those workers do. My father has had a bit of ill health and I’ve had a couple of knee operations myself so I always see the work done by doctors and nurses as fantastic.“It was a way to give them a wee thank you but also to help Dundee and to donate money to Roxburgh House, which most people in Dundee have had relatives go to unfortunately.“The football club will decide how much ends up going there because we didn’t know how much we would raise at the start. There wasn’t a target, I hoped we’d get to about £,.“But I spoke to guys at the club and they said no matter the amount raised, the thank you message would be going on the shirts.“We got past £, quickly and I we’re over £, now.”He added: “There’s also been other stuff off the back of it too which has been great. Scott McRuvie from the Whitehall Theatre and a bunch of fans are running  mileswhich is fantastic and there’s been the shirt sale the club did and the raffle which have all raised money.“I’m really surprised with how much was raised but I know Dundee fans love the club. People have been great, I seen some guys put in £, others £ which is amazing for anybody to give. And there’s also people on the breadline who might only be able to afford a fiver but that’s just as important and shows their love for the club. It’s been brilliant.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – The big kick off for Utd, Dee fixtures and enough of SPFL nonsense\" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – The big kick off for Utd, Dee fixtures and enough of SPFL nonsense# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street- embed # secretHBukMDAv\" data-secret\"HBukMDAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Bringing back business safely remains a key priority.#Face coverings are mandatory for both passengers and crew throughout the flight, and new aircraft cleaning procedures have been introduced including disinfecting all surfaces in contact with customers.In addition, the air in the cabin is renewed every three minutes.KLM said it was a #positive sign of recovery# that more routes were beginning to operate after many were grounded to a halt in the past few months due to the coronavirus pandemic.Benedicte Duval, general manager for Air France KLM in the UK and Ireland, said: #Our decision to increase the frequency on our Aberdeen to Amsterdam service to four flights per day by the end of August is a positive sign of recovery, after what has been and still is a challenging time for our industry.#KLM continued to operate a skeleton service to and from Aberdeen throughout the corona crisis, assisting the local community with essential travel and repatriation. As travel restrictions in Scotland begin to ease, we are increasing capacity in line with consumer demand.#Meanwhile at home, both First Bus and Stagecoach have confirmed that service frequencies will be increased.First Aberdeen has said it has put a number of measures in place to ensure customer and staff safety is maintained, with timetables able tocloser to normal levels from tomorrow.Changes will affect most services, with revised departure times.There will be some increases on weekend services, as well as the frequency in evenings.The firm carries out an enhanced cleaning regime including the use of anti-viral sanitiser.Vehicles have also been updated with new layouts and signs to inform customers of the additional seats available on board.First Aberdeen is encouraging people toto public transport, and is focusing on improving services where demand has ed.David Phillips, operations director at First Aberdeen, said: #We are looking forward to welcoming back even more customers over the coming weeks and months as the vast majority of services now begin to operate nearer to pre-Covid timetable levels.#This means that with social distancing still in place, we will have many more seats available than in recent weeks and services operating at higher frequencies.#We know that this additional capacity and frequency will be a great relief to some commuters, as well as customers considering their first journeys for leisure purposes.#We are delighted to play our part in helping to get the local economy moving again.#For full details on the new timetables, visit bit.ly XdNNvUMeanwhile Stagecoach will also be running more services from Monday.It has said it will be increasing its offering across Aberdeenshire and Moray ahead of the school bus services resuming, but also to help connect people with workplaces and high streets.Increases will take place on services such as  X from Aberdeen to Stonehaven via Portlethen,  from Aberdeen to Inverness via Elgin,  from Aberdeen to Elgin via Banff,  from Aberdeen to Braemar via Banchory and the Buchan area network.Stagecoach said the increase in services will help to maintain social distancing.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place.

The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt

believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

other local authorities, that doesnrsquot make it easier to address.ldquoI tried to give a message of hope in March and whilst there is more to hopefor there is now no less uncertainty.ldquoIt is estimated that only five per cent of the Scottish population has actually had COVID- which means that the best that almost all of us can hope, is that we maypersonally not be susceptible to a

path will run alongside the footpath between the boatyard access at Prestonpans to just past the old power station with a white line separating the cyclepath and walkway.This is the councilrsquos latest project to improvesocial distancing in the wake of the Covid- crisis.The local authority received pound.million from the Scottish Governmentrsquos Spaces for People fund to introduce ious countywide measures to make it easier to social distance in town centres and improve cycle and pedestrian paths.As well as the roadside cycle route, the speed limit on Edinburgh Road, which is normally mph, will be reduced to mph and speed limits in the twocommunities reduced to just mph.The plan for the cycle path has seen dozens of painted stones created by local schoolchildren, which line the footpath, move across to the other side of the road.The stones are a symbol of hope and unity during the Covid- crisis, and many similar displays have been created throughout East Lothian and the whole country.Councillor Norman Hampshire, environment spokesperson at East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe received many comments in the public consultation around Spaces for People on the need to provide suitable space for people cycling.ldquoMany people are currently cycling this route and we need to cater for the current increase in cyclists during the pandemic period.ldquoIn common with other Spaces for People measures, this route is for temporary use as we gradually move out of restrictions and will also provide a viable alternative to the use of the private car and or public transport for shorter-distanced essential or leisure trips in the area.The works also include the introduction of temporary crossings of Edinburgh Road at either end of the route through the use of lsquobuildoutsrsquo and bolt-down bollards.In addition, the proposals also include traffic calming measures on Edinburgh Road to slow down traffic with a temporary reduction in the speed limit to mph between the two communities, in tandem with the introduction of mph limits within the communities themselves.MrHampshire added: ldquoWe were aware of a collection of painted stones that have been carefully laid by local schoolchildren alongside the existing footway along Edinburgh Road and recognise that these are important to the local community.ldquoThe community council arranged for these

councilrsquos Local Review Body overturned the refusal on appeal after councillors ruled the proposal was better than leaving the building to fall into disrepair.And they questioned whether the design of the new property, which featured extensive glass frontage to let in light, would, in fact, make the amenity more acceptable.Planning officers had estimated the new one-bedroom property would offer just nine square metres of living space in the proposed kitchen living area.The review body was told that there was no set standard for amenity and outlook when it came to conversions like the one put forward for the building, on the townrsquos Lamer Street.Instead, Leigh Taylor, council planning advisor, said it was down to the inidual officer involved.He said: ldquoThere is no exact standard, it

the rear for amenity. The site is also opposite the beach.Councillor Sue Kempson, review body member and ward councillor, said she believedit was important to see the building used for a new purpose and did not feel the lack of amenity was a problem, adding: ldquoNot everyone wants a garden.Fellow member Councillor Neil Gilbert agreed, adding: ldquoA building like this, the longer it is left the more it deteriorates. It has to find a new purpose.Councillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairman and ward member, also upheld the appeal.He said: ldquoIt has to have another use either as commercial or residential and I think residential is a good fit for this building.

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set.

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Among those caught out by the rule change was Englandrsquos Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps.Jon Ashworth, Shadow Health Secretary, called the Governmentrsquos performance ldquoshambolic.\"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenere who are confused, and they dont know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks quarantine. The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics. Isnrsquot it time to take a break, she wondered, go round the golf course or to the shepherdrsquos hut  David Cameron famously opted for the latter, spending a cool pound, on one for his Cotswolds garden.Mr Blair seemed momentarily taken aback. ldquoItrsquos not something I want to do. A lot of people might think thatrsquos exactly what he should do, stop talking about things. But I care about the country, I think we are at a huge moment of change in the world.Addressing the elephant backseat passenger in the room, he went on: ldquoIrsquove tried to do something that previous prime ministers have not done, but in the future I predict that many more will try and do because you leave office when yoursquove still got a lot of years of active working le.ldquoI always say to peopleyou donrsquot want to listen to me itrsquos a free world, donrsquot bother.\"But Irsquom not going to be playing rounds of golf or sitting twiddling my thumbs.

Yes, I know this company has in the past been guilty of cheesy adverts showing perfect couples schmoozing, and yoursquove probably heard rumours that all-inclusives are boring and sometimes the quality of food and drink is dubious, but in this instance none of that is the case. Quite the reverse.You find a mix of all age-groups there ndash just not families.

You can walk along the beach there once their security guards have checked you have come from Sandals, but other than a few nudes on the beach, thatrsquos all you can witness. .Sandals Negril has a more modern feel than any of the other Sandals properties on the island, especially in their beautul butler villa suites. Public areas are typically Caribbean in deacutecor, with buzzing ceiling fans, dark tropical wood furniture and nearly every space open to the sea breeze.The staff are laid back and super-friendly, as Jamaicans typically are, so you can expect service served up with a good dose of banter.

Once we got through the Braveheart and Rangers Celtic stereotypes we were off and away.Personal butlers are at your beck and call in many of the suites.

Even the basic rooms are lovely with rainfall showers, four-poster beds and marble bathrooms.

Therersquos a general acceptance that, rather than sharing culpability with previous generations, we are the ones at whose door it can be laid. Obviously there is a lot of truth in that, as we continue to consume oceans of gas and oil, and despoil the seas with plastic. Yet the culprits for harming nature and tipping it out of kilter can be found in centuries past as well as in the international departure lounges of our airports. We should not shoulder all the blame.Irsquom thinking, as one example in my own backyard, of James V. For all his qualities as a leader he was never as impressive as his father James IV, or even his daughter Mary Queen of Scots. Quite apart from his military deficiencies at the Battle of Solway Moss, James V is the man who introduced , sheep into the Ettrick Valley, to raise money for his ambitious plans. In so doing, he destroyed the ancient Ettrick Forest, in which he and other royals had hunted and killed stags by the barrowload. The kingrsquos flocks arrived a some point after , and it did not take them long to strip the valley of its trees. By our own times, all that was left of this magnicent haven for wildle was a handful of thorn trees and birches. The rest is empty scrubland.I learned about this vandalous act in a newly published collection of essays called A Journey in Landscape Restoration: Carrran Wildwood and Beyond, edited by the biologists Philip and Myrtle Ashmole. Unlike most of the books I read this is not about the past, but about the future. There are almost as many photos as words, but the ones that most vividly illustrate the tale are those taken of the Carrran Valley, in the hills near Moffat.At the end of last century, this was a bleak expanse of severely depleted upland, grazed almost to extinction. A winter photo from  shows it as a dreary unrelieved desert: think of a chocolate brownie and yoursquod be close, though dusted with snow rather than icing sugar. Now, after  years of dedicated work by volunteers, it is growing lush once more. Swathes of native woodland clothe the hillsides, and its increasingly rich undergrowth is attracting an abundance of birds, insects, flowers, fungi and amphibians. The range of moths alone is heart-warming. As before and after images go, the dference could hardly be more striking.Previously you would have been lucky to hear much more than a grouse cackling, or watch a buzzard circling overhead now it is like the RSNO, as a sorts of birdle, from meadow pippits to willow warblers, wrens and winchats, strike up from the branches of native trees: birch, aspen, ash, oak, willow, rowan, hazel, Scots pine and juniper.In a series of pithy pieces,  of those who helped bring about this transformation describe how they went about it. Philip Ashmole originally had the idea to recreate an area of woodland in the Borders that replicated how it would have been before humans arrived. Out of this notion the Wildwood Group was established, which later formed itself into the Borders Forest Trust. On Millennium Day, the trust took ownership of the Carrran Valley, and set to work on creating a wildwood.In subsequent years, other ecological restoration schemes were also begun, at Corehead and Devilrsquos Beef Tub, and Talla and Gameshope. Together these groundbreaking ventures began to restore an area they have named The Wild Heart of Southern Scotland. Inspired by their example, others are now following their lead across the country.Living as I do in one of the great medieval sheep rearing districts of the Borders, in the vicinity of Melrose Abbey, itrsquos not hard to see the effect  and more years of grazing have had on the landscape. As one of the contributors to this book writes, sheep are engrained in our economy and culture, and they are the main reason, along with other herbivores such as voles, deer, goats and rabbits, why native woodland planting is rare: ldquoItrsquos no mystery: sheep eat trees. As flocks expanded, their predators ndash wolves and lynx ndash were killed, so that today other grazers, and especially deer, roam and breed without any natural check.The Borders Forest Trustrsquos vision was aided by bodies like the Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage, but its core remained a motivated army of volunteers. Many of these came with scientic credentials ndash geographers, botanists, ornithologists, ecologists and such like. Others were simply determined to help re-establish wilderness in barren terrain. One weekend last autumn,  members of the Glasgow branch of Extinction Rebellion arrived at Gameshope, and in two days helped plant , trees. In the words of Anna Craigen, the trustrsquos work would been impossible without volunteers: ldquoThey are our muscles, brains, eyes, dirty hands and the true heart of the Wild Heart.What is so uplting about this story is not just the determination and imagination of those who have made all this happen, but the tangible evidence of the regeneration they have promoted. Page after page of A Journey in Landscape Restoration is filled with photos of wildle now thriving in Carrran.Amid the bad news headlines about climate change, and images of bush fires, floods and landslides, it is good to be reminded of the things being done to turn the tide. Work such as that in Carrran Wildwood not only restores nature to its rightful state, but gives a terric boost to our own depleted sense of hope.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Use secateurs to remove all this yearrsquos foliage and old fruiting stems, leaving a bare -cm high crown. Fresh leaves emerge within a week or two -ndash promise!You also ensure good health by keeping fruit bushes well-shaped. So remove spindly little branches emerging in the centre. Aim for a goblet design, with  or  main branches forming a perimeter round an open centre.But keep an eye out for stronger young branches that yoursquoll need to replace old ones.Let a newcomer grow on for a year or two before making the change.Remove any inward-facing stems. And since the main branches should be fan-shaped, remove any crossing and touching stems. Shorten branch and stemby up to one third, particularly those growing downwards.Fresh stems from the base of trained cordon and fan-shaped fruit should also be removed, and prune to maintain the basic shape. With fans, cut back laterals to the desiredand similarly with cordons.Redcurrants and gooseberries fruit on mature wood, so the more of that you remove, the smaller next yearrsquos crop will beBlackcurrants fruit on one year old as well as mature wood, so remove two thirds of older branches to allow for a larger proportion of fresh ones.For a good crop, always retain one third of the mature wood.The raspberry family, including loganberries, Tayberries and the rest, behave quite dferently and, with the exception of autumn raspberries, only fruit on fresh canes or branches. So cut all fruited stems down to ground level.With rasps, aim for six of the strongest stems for next year. So, to ensure against any possible winter damage, select the eight or nine strongest ones, loosely tying them to the wires.Autumn raspberries are pruned at the end of winter, harvesting from fresh canes.When removing old canes in February, you could retain two or three and they would produce fruit in summer.This is possibleyoursquore limited for space. Otherwise, grow both types of plant and remove all fruited canes annually.With bush raspberries, cut out all the old stems to prevent congestion: thriving plants produce a prodigious young forest every year and that too needs thinning.And never clip soft fruit bushes like a hedge or simply shorten raspberry canes.To my horror, someone I know did this to an autumn iety one summer and wondered why she had no crop.Late summer early autumn pruning helps maintain healthy, well-shaped plants and while it improves the quality of next yearrsquos harvest, you get larger gooseberries by shortening fruiting spurs in early spring.But a few soft fruit bushes, like blueberries need virtually no pruning.Plant of the weekHyssop, Hyssopus officinalis, bears deep blue flowers with prominent stamens that are attractive to all sorts of bees.

Such entitled arrogance was typied this week by the hysterical and childish Twitter response of Humza Yousaf, alumnus of Hutchesonsrsquo Grammar in Glasgow, to reasonable criticism of his sinister and incoherent Hate Crime bill.Research conducted by The Herald in  showed that MSPs were five times more likely than the average Scot to be privately educated. Among the rest, the triumph of party hacks and the professional middle-classes is dismally apparent.Nowhere is the dread hand of middle-class complacency more apparent than in the Scottish Government. The SNP cabinet reads like the staff register for Classic FM. Each one has a degree and several have multiple parchments, including one who seems to have been competing with Jim Murphy for the title of Scotlandrsquos student prince.Earlier this year, the academics Michael Keating and Paul Cairney in an article first published by the Centre for Constitutional Change maintained that the hegemony of the political elites at Westminster has been replicated at Holyrood. It built on general themes the pair had previously explored in a paper published in . Keating and Cairney concluded that among MSPs ldquoa common middle-class background predominated. ldquoMany such occupations ndash such as in law or education ndash were once described as politics facilitating because they offered the skills or connections conducive to seeking election.Their observations reflected research conducted by University College London in  that examined the policy preferences of working-class and career politicians within the Labour Party both before and during Tony Blairs tenure as leader. It showed that working-class MPs were much more in favour of traditional welfare policies than their careerist colleagues. This had contributed greatly during the Blair era towards more centrist polices around reforming welfare and a much diminished representation of working-class voters interests. ldquoPut bluntly, said the reportrsquos author, ldquocareerist MPs are much more likely to blow with the political winds.The SNP, it seems, is modelling itself on Mr Blairrsquos New Labour principles. In a remarkable and detailed essay written by George Kerevan earlier this month, the former SNP politician excoriated the party for its cultivation of Big Business and a ruthless party machine driving a byzantine bureaucracy than can only be traversed by favoured acolytes and savants whorsquove been given the secret passwords.Itrsquos not now enough to have supported the SNP and fought for independence all of your adult le to be deemed fit for a party nomination. You are also expected to defer to the esoteric cult of political fetishists gaining influence in the party.Stepping into this circle is Chris McEleny, who announced on Thursday that he is seeking to become the SNPrsquos candidate in Inverclyde at next yearrsquos Scottish Parliament elections. I wish him well but I donrsquot envy him. If he emerges unscathed and successful from the partyrsquos vetting procedures the task of facing down the unionist parties will be a breeze in comparison.Mr McEleny is an authentic, working-class tradesman from Greenock who has led the SNP group on Inverclyde Council with some distinction. The SNP high command though, have made it clear they donrsquot want people like him anywhere near their salons and boutiques. Recently he was attacked ndash in adolescent manner ndash by Alyn Smith in an article that recalled Denis Healeyrsquos famous observation about Geoffrey Howe and dead sheep. Later he attracted the petulant wrath of Pete Wishart for insisting that the SNP be a little more, you know hellip pro-active in the independence department. Smith and Wishart are tame party courtiers: desperate to please the leadership less so in constructing a route towards independence.McElenyrsquos experience at the hands of party managers is broadly similar to that of Chris Stephens, another authentic, working-class activist who did more than anyone to persuade some of Scotlandrsquos trade unions to transfer their allegiances to the SNP from Labour. Yet only after more than a decade of rejection did the SNP deign to let him compete at the  election.Mr McEleny has been subjected to a campaign of intimidation and harassment carrying the stamp of the party hierarchy and carried out by an insidious pack of jackals on social media. Everything from his Catholic faith his criticism of GRA reforms his admiration for Joanna Cherry and his inconveniently persistent calls for an independence Plan B has been subject to abuse from the SNPrsquos secret police.In recent months his has been a lone voice pleading for an emergency economic aid package for Inverclyde, home to Scotlandrsquos poorest neighbourhood. Coronavirus death and infection rates in Inverclyde are three times higher than the national average and Mr McEleny has been this communityrsquos most eloquent advocate.Not possessing a degree and being a manual worker he would be an exotic creature inside the Holyrood party. And possessing such views as he does also makes him the wrong type of nationalist for the SNP in the same way that Joanna Cherry is the wrong sort of feminist.If the SNP persists with its aggressive obsession with rewriting the rules on human biology and their latest attempts to criminalise the Scottish population they will make themselves unelectable, no matter what the rosy opinion polls currently suggest. They are fast becoming the biggest threat to the prospect of an independent Scotland.

For example, global drinks giant Diageo set a target to cut its emissions by %. Operating  sites across Scotland, including  malt whisky distilleries, Diageo has invested heavily in its on-site bio-energy facilities using by-products from distillation to create anaerobic and biomass power supplies.As a whole, the whisky industry is leading the way in terms of investment and innovating in reducing its environmental impacts. The Scotch Whisky Associationreports that water efficiency in the distillation process has improved by % since , % of packaging is now made from recycled materials, and % of the industryrsquos energy now comes from renewable sources.Improving environmental sustainability isnrsquot just a moral obligation for food and drink businesses it is increasingly becoming essential to keep and attract buyers and consumers.Graham Young, Industry Development Director at Scotland Food and DrinkOne company that has realised the commercial benefits of improving its sustainability is Border Biscuits. Based in Lanarkshire, the -year-old business recently redesigned its packaging to reduce the plastic used by %.The baker estimates that the move saved  tonnes of CO equivalent emissions from the packaging manufacturing process and will reduce the number of vehicles needed to transport the products by %, making considerable cost-savings and strengthening the brandrsquos reputation as environmentally responsible.Changing the packaging and reconfiguring its manufacturing took Border Biscuits two years to complete and was part of a wider investment into its products and processes.Household names making wholesale changes to their products or processes arenrsquot the only food and drink businesses in Scotland who are leading the charge in the fight against climate change.The Crafty Pickle Co, a food fermenter based in Aberdeen was set up by founders Madi and Arthur to create delicious small-batch pickles using perfectly edible, imperfect, surplus produce.Vegetables that would otherwise end up being thrown out based on aesthetics are given a new lease of le through preserving fermentation or pickling ndash turning food waste into profit.The company estimates that . million tonnes of edible food is wasted each year with one third of food produced never leaving the farm.Wersquore blessed with a rich green countryside,plentul rainfall, rich seas and a talented workforce, all of which contribute to Scotlandrsquos already remarkably green food and drink supply.Scotland punches above its weight in terms of sustainability, particularly in meat production. According to QMS, around % of Scottish farmland is unsuitable for growing cereals and vegetables but can support beef and lamb production. Scottish beef is among the most sustainably farmed globally using low-density, grass-fed herds while Scotlandrsquos hill and upland grasslands play a substantial role in the countryrsquos carbon capture.Despite clear and signicant improvements in the environmental efficacy of the food and drink industry, there is still more that can be done across the board.Coronavirus impacts have touched every business and person in the country in myriad ways, but one positive outcome of the pandemic has been consumersrsquo support for local food and producers. Shortening supply chains and shopping local is a really simple but effective way consumers can cut CO emissions from unnecessary food miles.For producers, there is no one size fits all approach to becoming more environmentally sustainable, butwe each make incremental changes to systems and processes can have dramatic positive effects for our environment. There is a wealth of support for businesses of all shapes and sizes to adopt greener practices from organisations like SEPA and Zero Waste Scotland.As well as Scotlandrsquos natural resources, wersquore also blessed with human talent and brain power. Our scientic, research and manufacturing sectors will play a key collaborative role in driving sustainability development with our prized food and drink sector.For all the evils Coronavirus has caused, it also offers us an opportunity as an industry to re-evaluate where we are, where we want to be and how we can get there together. Environmental sustainability must be a central pillar in rebuilding our food and drink industry, strengthening our global brand and reputation, and ultimately playing our role in protecting the future of our planet. n----------------------------------------------------------Brewer pours investment into carbon reduction initiativesOne of Scotlandrsquos most famous drinks brands is going above and beyond in its drive to be carbon neutral, finds Anthony HarringtonThe pressure is ratcheting up on all companies around the world to work at lowering their carbon footprint, and Scottish businesses, by and large, are responding well. With Earth Overshoot day on  August coming ever closer, the need for companies to play their part in the drive to make Scotland a net-zero economy by  is clear.Over % of our businesses comply with environmental regulations, according to a February report from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency . This was the fourth year in a row that Scottish businesses have achieved this level of compliance.Many are going above and beyond mere compliance and are actively pushing towards becoming carbon neutral. SEPA is encouraging this through the use of what the Agency calls Sustainable Growth Agreements . These are voluntary formal agreements between SEPA and businesses that focus on practical action to deliver environmentally positive outcomes.Martin Doogan, Group Engineering Manager at CC, left, with Terry ArsquoHearn, SEPA Chief ExecutiveThe Agencyrsquos chief executive, Terry ArsquoHearn, pointed to the performance of both the Scottish Whisky industry and the brewing sector as examples of the positive impact that active sustainability initiatives can bring about across industries.ldquoWersquore pleased to recognise the exceptionally high standards of compliance from Scotlandrsquos distillers and brewers, ArsquoHearn said.Both sectors achieved a .% compliance rating, up from % the prior year.Scotlandrsquos leading brewer, the Glasgow-based Tennent Caledonian was singled out by ArsquoHearn for special praise. The brewery, founded in , received an lsquoexcellentrsquo rating for the third year in a row.Tennentrsquos has made sustainability an integral part of its business model with initiatives that have included launching a major consumer awareness campaign and becoming the first brewer in the UK to join the UK Plastics Pact, set up by WRAP, the Waste and Resources Action Programme.As part of this, the brewer has committed to phasing out shrink-wrap from its packs. Cans are being packaged in cardboard rather than using plastic rings to hold packs together. The firm has pledged to do away with all instances of single-use plastics by  and has said that it will cease using plastics altogetherby  ndash the same year that it aims to have all its energy supplied from renewable sources.Martin Doogan, Group Engineering Manager at CC , points out that the company has invested signicantly in environmental performance enhancements at its Wellpark site.This includes putting in an anaerobic digestion plant and a carbon capture facility which, he says is lsquothe biggest of its kind in Scotlandrsquo.Completing this September, it will enable the brewer to capture and store the CO that is generated as a byproduct during fermentation. The facility aims to capture and store , tonnes of CO annually. In addition, the brewer will be able to use the CO to carbonate the beer. This means it will not need to source CO externally, which it estimates will eliminate the carbon output associated with some , kilometres of road haulage.Martin Doogan said: ldquoThe installation of the new facility marks another milestone in our commitment to challenging climate change and itrsquos been fantastic seeing the tanks put into place and everything come together and we are eagerly anticipating having everything operational later in the year.There is no doubt that companies benefit from having their brands associated with sustainability and carbon reduction efforts. Consumers today are more aware than ever of the need to mitigate and slow down climate change to safeguard the future, with younger consumers showing the highest levels of awareness and concern.A lsquoFuture of Humanityrsquo survey by Amnesty International sampled the opinions of ,  to -year-oldsacross countries. Overwhelmingly, respondents cited global warming as the most important issue facing the world.More generally, Scotlandrsquos food and drinks sector already has a proud record in striving to mitigate its carbon footprint, and even to become net-negative. The Arbikie distillery on the east coast of Scotland, owned by three brothers, John, Iain, and David Stirling, recently launched what it calls the worldrsquos first lsquoclimate positiversquo gin, called Nagravedargin.Nagravedar gin is made from peas rather than from cereals, like other gins. Peas do not require synthetic nitrogen to be added to the soil to facilitate their growth, avoiding having nitrogen run-off into the waterways and soils. Instead, they benefit the ecosystem and improve soil quality. Arbikie claims that its Nagravedar gin has a carbon footprint of -.kg CO equivalent per ml bottle.All the distilleries ingredients are grown on its farm and the brothers claim a proud record in provenance and traceability for all their products. The distillery uses its own locally grown juniper and locally produced honey, along with solar power. Waste from the distilling process is recycled wherever possible as feed for cattle.Encouraging as these instances are, there is still an urgent need to do more. SEPA points out thateveryone in the world lived as we do in Scotland, wersquod consume the equivalent of the output of three Earths.ldquoAs a society, we are over-using our planetrsquos resources.

However, the Scottish Reformation saw it and other abbeys across the country abandoned.The abbey was restored by the Iona Cathedral Trustees at the start of the th century. Then, in , the Reverend George MacLeod established the Iona Community in the docklands of Govan and on Iona.Despite crippling poverty as a result of the Depression, he gathered unemployed skilled craftsmen and young trainee clergy to carry out a major reconstruction programme.The stone and slate buildings, originally the living quarters of the monks, attract around  guests every year who arrive seeking sanctuary, respite and a place to worship. Many of the annual , day visitors to Iona also visit and worship at the abbey church.Writing in the Iona Communityrsquos Annual Report, Christine Jones, Coordinator of the Iona Abbey Capital Appeal, said: ldquoGeorge MacLeodrsquos lsquobuilding projectrsquo was  years in the making. The current work has taken a quarter of that time. However, there is no doubt that lsquohis-storyrsquo has inspired the dedicated project team and the many generous donors.ldquoThe commitment for a sustainable redevelopment means that rooms are now thoroughly insulated, and accessible, and the elements will soon be harnessed to create heating for the accommodation through a renewable energy system.ldquoThe achievement is all the more remarkable given that the successful pound. million initiative to rebuild the Iona Village Hall will also come to completion during summer .Iona, with its population of around , is said to be in a ldquoregeneration phase, with an increasingly young population with dynamic ideas for improving le on the island.In a message on the Iona Abbey fundraising pages, Shiona Ruhemann, of Iona Community Council, said: ldquoTherersquos a universal feeling on Iona just now that the island is really thriving and regenerating.

Some have been with us for centuries, with deep roots in our past and present. ldquoThey will matter for future generations, the SFC said before adding: ldquoThat said, we will be considering the overarching framework that can further develop a connected, collaborative ecosystem for learning and teaching and research reflects government and tertiary education objectives and secures accountability for public funding.:Scottish universities at risk of being wiped out by Covid- crisis , experts warnThis language worries some university insiders. Some academics fear a creeping ldquofederalisation of their institutions, the idea that there might be a de-facto overarching decision-making umbrella above inidual universities. Or, at the very least, that universities would have to accept some co-ordination on what they teach.Universities in Scotland already face effective rationing on student numbers on certain courses, because of both funding and practical considerations. Medical schools, for example, cannot teach more doctors or nurses than the NHS can offer placements too.However, there is nervousness inside universities about how they balance teaching to meet the SFCrsquos ldquogovernment objectives and to cater to what students actually want to learn.David Lott, deputy director of Universities Scotland, struck a diplomatic note. ldquoClearly Government is a major funder and there has always been a strategic dialogue between institutions and funders on the subject mix needed to meet the needs of industries and public services, ldquohe said. ldquoThat will continue to be an important part of how universities decide on their offering to learners across the world. Ultimately it comes down to learner choice what and where they want to study. It is important that higher education starts with their ambitions and meeting them with a high quality offer.There have been worries that government ministers or officials will see mergers as the solution to post-Covid austerity. The SNP has already overseen old local colleges brought together in to regional giants. Mr Lott said: ldquoMergers donrsquot save money. Thatrsquos been proven time and time again across a range of sectors. If therersquos a solid academic rationale and business case for a merger, the institutions themselves will be exploring it. Universities have always pursued strategic change and there are a lot of options universities can take to adapt provision and reconfigure how they work that are likely to be far more effective and efficient than mergers. The focus now should be on stabilisation and then adaptation and strategic change rather than focusing the number or institutions. Those conversations are happening now with the Funding Council as part of its Covid-inspired review of provision.In England, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has signalled that universities - infor support - must refocus more on STEM subjects and preparing a new generation of health workers and teachers in a new lsquorestructuring regimersquo.Scotland - to sighs of relief inside universities - is not going down that route. Ministers told stakeholders so last week.The root of Scotlandrsquos university funding crisis is that the government does not cover the full cost of tuition. So institutions raise money from commercial businesses and the fees of foreign students to plug the gap. And it looks like many foreign students may not enrol this year. Indeed, there is uncertainty over domestic numbers too.:Coronavirus: Scottish universities could have to curtail research ambitions amid funding reviewMr Lott said: ldquoWhen it comes to admissions and the intake for this next year, universities are in totally unchartered waters. ldquoUsually by this time in the cycle, when universities have received the Higher results and have matched pupilsrsquo grades to the offers made, universities would have a very solid sense of the Scottish intake numbers. Even after results day, those acceptances canrsquot necessarily be relied on this year. And the picture for international students is even less certain. Having said that, universities are getting very positive feedback from students who are eager to get on with their lives and start university in the autumn.He added: ldquoldquoThe pandemic has tested universities and university finances on a scale never seen before. Earlier in the year we described it as an existential crisis. A lot of mitigating steps have been taken since then however, universities are still walking into the new academic year with some major unknowns and itrsquos this year where the biggest financial hit was always going to come for universities so therersquos still an awful lot at stake.ldquoItrsquos impossible to compare the impact of the coronavirus pandemic to anything that has come before but it is important to remember that this crisis coincides with the major upheaval and uncertainty of Brexit and, comes after a number of years of cuts by the Scottish Government to the funding of teaching and research. Universitiesrsquo financial resilience to cope with a crisis like this was already severely depleted.Universities Scotland wants the Scottish Government to cover the full cost of tuition. Mr Lott said: ldquoWhat has become crystal clear to everyone as a consequence of the pandemic, is the extent to which international students fees subsidise the cost of Scottish studentsrsquo education.The UCU, which represents university staff, welcomed Scotlandrsquos decision not to follow England. Mary Senior, the unionrsquos top Scottish official, said this was a ldquohuge reliefrsquo, saying the ewe had an ldquoincredibly narrow vision for the future of higher education. She added: ldquoWe are clear that to truly power economic and social recovery in Scotland we need to support the ersity, breadth and depth of our university sector. ldquoThis means valuing and resourcing the widening access work to bring new learners - young and old - to gain new skills and higher learning opportunities. It goes without saying that the vocational skills universities provide in science, technology, engineering - and medical science in particular - are crucial to get us through this pandemic. However we also need to invest in teaching, and supporting arts, humanities and social science disciplines which help us to understand the world in which we live.ldquoWe do need the two governments to be working together to properly resource universities, so they are powering the education-led recovery, and not adding to the growing numbers of unemployed.There remain concerns that ldquooverarching strategic view from the Scottish Government might see universities slash certain kinds of courses, including foreign languages, especiallythey are offered by a neighbouring institution.Dundee University has already dumped German and several other institutions are understood to be considering scaling back languages in what linguists have said amounts to an lsquointellectual Brexit.The Scottish Government confirmed that it was opting out of the Williamsonrsquos ldquorestructuring regime - though it said it would continue to work with the UK authorities - which play a key role in research funding.A spokeswoman added: ldquoWe eagerly await the outcome of the Scottish Funding Councilrsquos review as the outputs of this will help inform our planning for the higher education sector and all tertiary education in Scotland. "},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-ancient-universities-reliance-foreign-students","story":"It is not the funniest line. Or the most accurate. But there is just enough truth in it to spark nervous smiles. That is because Scottish universities, especially some of the countryrsquos most prestigious institutions, have become increasingly dependent on the fees paid by foreign students - nearly a third of them Chinese.And this once booming business means universities are particularly exposed to the Covid crisis.The government, despite the SNPrsquos flagship policy of free tuition, only picks up something like p in every pound it costs to teach Scottish, or, more technically, ldquoScottish-domiciled, students.To balance their books, institutions have sometimes lucrative sidelines, such as providing accommodation or campus coffees at a profit or using their facilities to host conferences. During the lockdown that income has evaporated, stripping poundm out of the sector.Universities also have students from the rest of the UK who pay their own fees - but these do little more than cover costs. It is foreign students - who pay more than British ones - who are keeping the big prestigious institutions able to attract them in surplus. Until Covid, that is.There are fears that half of those foreigners will not materialise this coming academic year. And not just because they do not want to come.Even as lockdowns ease, prospective students are expected to struggle to get visas as bureaucracy catches up with a coronavirus backlog.With flights cancelled all around the world, there are also simple logistical problems for students to get to Scotland.In England and Wales some universities have said they will charter whole planes to bus in their customers. Scottish institutions are understood to have considered this but ruled it out as too complicated.Universities, of course, do not just teach. They have a huge role in research too - and get funding from a iety of sources to carry this out. Does such funding really cover all the costs of research  Not necessarily.So Scotlandrsquos seats of higher learning are effectively operating an underlying structural deficit. Most of the prestigious ancient universities have been able to plug this gap with money from foreign students. Some of the more modern institutions, which tend to focus on local students and vocational courses, have not.Despite the current crisis, none of this is news inside the sector. Late last year Scotlandrsquos public finance watchdog Audit Scotland said that the aggregated financial position of the  universities was good but that surpluses were concentrated at three ancient universities, Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews, with high numbers of foreign or English students.Its snapshot, based on -, measured total income in the sector at pound.bn. That number - thanks to fee-paying foreign students at Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews - was up.But success at the ldquorich three concealed problems where. Only pound.bn came from the Scottish Government to support students, including pound.bn from the Scottish Funding Council. This SFC budget had fallen seven per cent in real terms since -, the watchdog said.The result: more than half of Scottish universities were in deficit in -. Six of them were in deficit every year for four years. Modern universities are far more dependent in the SFC and struggling.The Covid crisis has turned this reality on its head. Because it is now the ancients exposed to foreign students which are in the most trouble.That is because foreign students at last count contributed account for poundm in fees, just under a third of this from mainland China. That is before universities sell them accommodation and other services. However, breakdowns of Chinese students alone show how dferent the picture is across the Scottish sector.Edinburgh has , Chinese students. Across the capital Queen Margaret has just five. Glasgow has ,, Glasgow Caledonian has .This Chinese market comes with a series of risks, including geo-political ones.There are real concerns in Scotland that a dramatic worsening of relations between the UK and China, including the removal of telecoms giant Huawei from G infrastructure for national security and concerns about oppression of Uigher minority and the crackdown in Hong Kong, will affect the influx of students.This summer Hong Kong students in Scotland - a signicant group in themselves - said they felt the chilling presence of China on campus.This was because of organised Chinese student groups and the presence of vetted mainland cadres working at controversial Confucius Institutes, language-learning centres funded by the Communist regime at five universities.As recently as - there were just  Chinese students at Scottish universities. The figure in - was ,, paying poundm in fees. That is twice as much as the next biggest category, students rom the United States.Last week Glasgowrsquos principal, Anton Muscatelli, warned that Britainrsquos lsquosoft powerrsquo would be erodeduniversities were to be forced to turn away Chinese students. The rise in numbers from the authoritarian mainland is now down to universities choosing Chinese. It is partly because of UK Government immigration policies that make it easier for Chinese than, say, Indians or Nigerians, to get visas.The big boom in international students is in people looking for post-graduate degrees.In - Scotland had , students, just over , undergraduates. Of these, , were Scottish, , from somewhere  in the UK, , from the EU and just under , from the rest of the world.But on post-graduate courses Scots are in a minority. Just under , of the more than , post-grads in Scotland are Scottish. Nearly , are English, Welsh or Northern Irish, almost , from the EU and fully , are from the rest of the world.The strange economics behind this boom has not gone uncriticised. Early in the lockdown Stirling academic Peter Matthews expressed ldquoanger at the Scottish Government for forcing universities to go to an international market to keep their heads above the water.ldquoScottish universities have been forced to make a choice: stick to a flat-cash income from the Scottish Funding Council and watch your university slowly wither away as it loses staff through voluntary severance and natural wastage, and buildings and equipment fall into disrepair or make riskier investment decisions in the hope than theon these is high and allows you to expand, Matthews blogged. ldquoSo wersquore left with universities that have aggressively expanded into international higher education markets to pay for new staff, shiny new buildings and equipment, fantastic library resources and who are now horribly exposed as income from international students falls off a clf.ldquoStudents from Scotland will suffer because of this, as universities are forced to make staff redundant so class sizes increase and as very basic services like libraries and IT are curtailed to make budget savings.Covid is the short-term risk. But it has, critics exposed long-term vulnerabilities. There is no guarantee foreigners will keep coming.Competition for international students is not easy. Universities, who say the have a collective backlog of poundm in capital repairs, have to look their best. Some have embarked on ambitious building projects.They also have to look good in global rankings, which requires sound underlying financial health.Scottish universities bob up and down global league tables. The latest QS world rankings have three Scottish institutions in the top , with Edinburgh in th spot and Glasgow and St Andrews lower down the field.But institutions in English-speaking world - England, United States Canada and Australia - often outrank Scottish ones. And Chinese and other Asian institutions are rising fast with Beijingrsquos Peking University, or Beida, for example, now ahead of Edinburgh.Scotlandrsquos hybrid universities - with their austere managed state-funded market for local students and free-wheeling battle for global students - have more problems than Covid."},{"url":null,"title":"douglas-ross-officially-becomes-scottish-tory-leadership-candidate","story":"Mr Ross successfully passed thethreshold of  nominations needed under party rules to formally enter the contest to replace Jackson Carlaw.Anyone who wishes to challenge the Moray MP for the position of leader of the Scottish Conservatives will need to secure  nominations by midnight on Wednesday.Mr Carlaw shocked the nation when he resigned asScottish Tory leaderon Thursday stating that theparty needed a fresher face to take them forward it.:Douglas Ross: Five things you need to know about new potential Scottish Tory leaderIm delighted to have reached the key milestone of  nominations to become an official candidate for leader of the Scottish Conservatives.

Today sees the first day of The Orcadian’s online livestock shows, with the cattle and sheep sections kicking off. Ready, Set, Show!On what should have been East Mainland Show day, it’s only right that we have a match-up between two County Show cattle champions from the East. Today sees the  inter-breed champion judged against the supreme cattle champ from the year before, with the former exhibited by Balfour Baillie and the latter exhibited by his father, James Baillie.The  County Show beef champion was a -month-old Limousin cross heer, shown by Balfour Baillie from Sebay View, Tankerness. The unnamed heer’s sire was Craigatoke Jamieson and she was out of a homebred British Blue cross Limousin cow. She went on to be shown and sold at the Thainstone spectacular, on August , following the show.This will be tough decision as both animals were held in high regard by the judges at the time of their show victories. The judge from last year’s show, Albert Taylor from Northmuir, Kirriemuir said of Balfour Baillie#s heer: “She had a great carcass and bags of style. She had a real femininity about her as well.”The  supreme cattle champion was a December -born Limousin cross stot calf, shown by J. S. Baillie  Co, of Sebay Farm, Tankerness. The homebred animal was from a Limousin cross cow, sired by Newhouse Colorado. The stot itself was sired itself by Craigatoke Jameson.The unnamed stot went on to be shown at the  Thainstone spectacular that year, held on August .John Wight, from Bigger, was the interbreed cattle judge at the  County Show, of his winner he said: “He’s the best calf I’ve seen for some time. He was extraordinary – how he stood, his back end, top line, a lovely head and excellent on his legs. He was an outright champion.”SHEEP Our match-up in the sheep is between two Texels – the  County Show overall sheep champion and the champion from five years before, in . The  winner was a Texel gimmer owned by Robbie Scott, from Dawn Cottage, Holm.The gimmer was an embryo transfer, whose dam Robbie bought at the Lanark Premier Sale after it placed as a reserve champion and whose sire was a tup called Tophill Wall Street. The interbreed sheep judge that year was Jim Kennedy, of Lyonston Farm, Mayboyle, who said Mr Scott’s gimmer showed “a bit of power and strength” which he looks for in any breed.The judge said: “She had a very good head on her and very good skin. She was a beast that would have stood in any company at any show.”The  sheep champion was a Texel ewe lamb shown by Ivan Scott,  Hill of Heddle, Finstown. Born in March, the ewe lamb was by Cairness United and out of a Knap ewe by Knock Papoose. It was a very successful show for Mr Scott who hadn’t shown anything for the  years previous to the  show.Mr Kenny Mair, from Kinnermit Farm, in Turrf judged the ewe. He said of the champion: “The Texel is a very bright and alert animal who stood well. She had a fair bit of character.”Check back at .pm to see what our judges went for.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3221834.jpg--.jpg?1594293881000\n","title":"patricia ready to steer inner wheel","story":"BALLYMENA’S Patricia Perry, has been appointed as all Ireland Chairman of the Inner Wheel Organisation.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

If my daughter got Covid- it wouldn#t just make her sick, it would be really dire for her, she told the Belfast .Even in years to come I think we#ll still need to be careful and will just have to accept the new normal.She said the main positive change has been allowing health workers into the home for Kaidence and her younger brother Shaye , who has autism.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKaidence Tate at home  Facebook in no hurry to stop shieldingurlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news health coronavirus coronavirus-family-of-little-kaidence-tate--in-no-hurry-to-stop-shielding-.html\" aria-label\"Twitter\" target\"_blank\" class\"icon-twitter\" rel\"external\" data-s-category\"Content Link\" data-s-action\"Share\" data-s-label\"Share Inline|Twitter\"TwitterEmailWhatsappKaidence Tate at home This has been the first week we#ve actually been able to have health workers come into the house, eventhey are dressed in full PPE, she said.As much as it is scary to let people into your home, because Covid- really did cause a lot of anxiety for families like ours, it is nice to know we#re getting some normality back.The family have kept a strict adherence to lockdown, with only Paula or her husband Barrieleaving one at a time for shopping or hospital trips.I think we#ve gotten used to it, and there is a fear for us of going back to how things were.That#s especially true coming up to the winter months when we#ll probably need to shield a lot more.We would like to take a trip away somewhere but we#ll just take it week by week but we know that in our home and garden we#re in a safe place so we#re still happy enough.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKaidence with her dad Barrie Facebook in no hurry to stop shieldingurlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news health coronavirus coronavirus-family-of-little-kaidence-tate--in-no-hurry-to-stop-shielding-.html\" aria-label\"Twitter\" target\"_blank\" class\"icon-twitter\" rel\"external\" data-s-category\"Content Link\" data-s-action\"Share\" data-s-label\"Share Inline|Twitter\"TwitterEmailWhatsappKaidence with her dad BarrieShe said recent months had also been an anxious time for other parents in Kaidence#s school.A lot of the children have very complex needs so I would say there#s been a lot of sleepless nights, when all you want to do as a parent is keep them safe.We have no way of trying to help that, so a lot of people in our world are very worried and I would say they wouldn#t be skipping out the door today.Yesterday, the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged those who had been shielding to remain vigilant.He also called on the public to reassure the most vulnerable.As a rule of thumb, assume the person you are passing in the street or who is standing next to you in a queue has been shielding for months, he said.Put yourself in their shoes. They may well be very anxious about resuming everyday activities. Please be considerate and give them the space and time they need.We should all be #sticking to the script# when it comes to social distancing, respiratory hygiene and hand washing. Wearing a face covering in shops and other enclosed spaces is a really important way we can keep each other safe.

The Ormeau Road is busy on a Saturday for a reason. We#ve built up a complementary retail offer that people want to travel to, he said.The new amendment put forward will also snarl up traffic and people won#t want to come here again.We feel there is a concerted political will to close arterial routes in and around Belfast to drive a potential green agenda and backNichola Mallon#s aspiration for people to cycle and walk more. That#s absolutely admirable, but that still needs a careful and considered approach where everyone has their say.SDLP councillor Gary McKeown welcomed the decision to hold a robust consultation that took all views into account ahead of any pilot scheme.In reality, we can only see how these things would work in practice by trying them out, and a pilot would provide a safe, managed space to do this, he said.He added that officials would work with volunteers to aid the design of the trial, allowing proper time and subject to council approval.In a joint statement, DUP South Belfast MLA Christopher Stalford and Botanic councillor Tracy Carrol said many were alarmed by issues like parking and the likely impact on businesses.Whilst we accept the people behind this idea may have had good intentions, we believe that it should not proceed as it will have a negative effect on the area, they said. We are pleased that the community is to be fully and properly consulted on this matter and believe that the more scrutiny this idea receives, the less viable it becomes.Belfast Most ReadIn photos: Football fansto stadium for Irish Cup final between Ballymena United and Glentoran in UK firstCoronavirus: Concerns mounting over virus resurgence with more cases confirmed in Northern IrelandCritics take a poke at Wilson over face mask #muzzles# jibeLiving in exile... for love: Couples who married across the religious ide in NI and were forced to move overseas Wish you were here: Famous NI faces on how they#re spending the summer holidays and sunny childhood memories,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The industry reacted with disappointment to the UK government#s decision to impose a -day quarantine on tourists ing from Spain due to its growing level of coronavirus cases. The quarantine also covers Spain#s Canary and Balaeric Islands.TUI, the UK#s biggest tour operator, announced it is shutting around one third of its total of  stores.The decision was made following changes in customer behaviour, the firm said in a statement. Around  retail stores will remain following the closures. However, it would not comment on which Northern Ireland stores were at risk as a consultation is taking place.Tory MPs are putting pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to introduce coronavirus testing at airports to cut the -day quarantine.And a group of  airlines, airports and tourism leaders - including Belfast International Airport chief executive Graham Keddie - have also called on the Prime Minister to introduce virus tests for those arriving in the UK. TUI said stores which are have reopened since the pandemic are not at risk of closure. But only one of its  Northern Ireland stores - a branch at Waterloo Place in Londonderry - have so far reopened. The shutters remain down at branches in Armagh, Coleraine, Lisburn, Newtownards, Ballymena, Craigavon, Omagh, Dungannon and Newry - as well as two branches in Belfast#s CastleCourt Shopping Centre and on Bloomfield Avenue.The chain has  stores in the Republic and is based in Germany.Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said: We want to be in the best position to provide excellent customer service, whether it#s in a high street store, over the telephone or online, and will continue to put the customer at the heart of what we do. It is therefore imperative that we make these dficult cost decisions, look after our colleagues during such unprecedented uncertainty and also offer a modern customer service.TUI is the latest high street chain after bakery chain Greggs and bookseller Eason to indicate that it won#t reopen at least some of its shops following lockdown.Greggs is closing three of its  stores - while Eason has shut all seven of its remaining Northern Ireland stores.Glyn Roberts, the chief executive of Retail NI, hoped TUI would provide clarication on which stores will be affected by the closure plans.It#s fair to say that this was a company which was facing a signicant challenge before Covid- due to the growth in online holiday bookings, he said.And in other businesses such as Eason which have also faced troubles before Covid, Covid- has now almost finished them off.There are not just the effects from the numbers of jobs lost in retailers, but closures like TUI and Eason also had a knock-on effect as footfall into the area is diminished.The pandemic and lockdown have had a catastrophic effect on demand for overseas holidays, with many bookings cancelled after quarantine was introduced. Yesterday easyJet cancelled a number of its flights.In a letter to Mr Johnson, the bosses of British Airways, easyJet and Jet demanded a more nuanced policy than the -day quarantine.They called for the introduction of regional travel corridors to replace the blanket requirement of -day quarantine for anyone ing from an at-risk country.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps cut his family holiday in Spain short as a result. As he ed to the UK, he defended the UK government#s decision.I very much understand, it obviously had an impact on me and my family, and I#m very, very sorry and upset for the thousands of Brits who are either away or perhaps even haven#t managed to go away this summer as well to Spain, he said.But it#s absolutely essential we acted when we did, it#s why all four nations of the UK acted together and the figures since have turned out to justy that action.We have to, I think, have a clear message and make sure we act by adding entire countries to that list for the time being.People who test positive for coronavirus or display symptoms must now self-isolate for  days as Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned of a second wave starting to roll across Europe.The UK#s chief medical officers said on Thursday that the period must increase from the current rule of seven days because of the risk iniduals may still be able to spread Covid-.In a joint statement, they said the change for those who experience the key symptoms of a new continuous cough, high temperature or loss of taste or smell is needed because of the low but real possibility of infectiousness up to  days.Their move came as official analysis said England had the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe across the first half of .Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumReliance on nursing temps could jeopardise patient safety in Northern Ireland: reportPatient safety could be compromised by a reliance on temporary staff to plug gaps in Northern Ireland#s nursing and midwery sector, a report has warned.Northern Ireland PremiumBelfast#s #Breastival# in plagiarism rowThe organisers of an annual Belfast festival celebrating all things breastfeeding have expressed anger after their name was used by a well-known baby brand to promote a similar event.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

He pulled off a coup by adding Tyrone coach Gavin Devlin to a management team that includes his cousin Seamus Bradley and long-serving player Padriacuteg Kelly, who has also spent time as a senior selector. Coleraine ended their hopes for five-in-a-row and they were beaten by neighbours Glen in last years semi-final. His new captain Karl McKaigue could be set for a y spell on the sidelines after an Achilles injury in Sundays hurling victory over Ballinascreen. googletag.cmd.push Padraig Cassidy was hampered with injury during the county season, but apart from McKaigues injury the Slaughtneil boss reported a full hand to select from. He has been handed a defensive boost. Paul McNeill has ed after a troublesome shoulder injury, while there is also ato full fitness of goalkeeper Antoacutein McMullan and the versatile Barry McGuigan has emerged from retirement. Former winning captains Patsy Bradley and Francis McEldowney continue to squeeze every last drop from their stellar careers. They open their account against a Kilrea side, who are in their second season under manager Declan Bradley. The Pearses will look to the experience of Brian Oacuteg McAlary, James and Charlie Kielt to lead their youthful side, who are looking to build over the next five seasons from their recent minor winning team, who were pipped in the U final. googletag.cmd.push Larry Kielt is back in training after a cruciate ligament injury, but this first game may come too soon for his . Brian Oacuteg McAlaryand Peadar McLaughlinwill need assessed this week before Bradley makes his selection. In attack Daithi McLaughlin has been a ray of light for Kilrea and he will need support from Paddy Quigg. Three players pushing for the team are Daniel Madden, PJ McAleese and Odhran McLarnon. It is a tough opener for them and its hard to see them turning over an Emmets team looking to launch a title bid.

Kevin Brady, who played a cameo junior football role for Ogra Colmcille two seasons ago, has joined him after helping St Marys Magherafelt to MacRory Cup success. Other than a game with St Eunans, Bradley has tried in vain to get any more challenge games to put any stamp on his side, which has kept the same personnel as recent seasons. Paul Young will miss the game due to work commitments in England, while defender Connor McVey and Roddy OKane are struggling with injury. On the plus side, Derry player Jason Rocks is on his way back and could see action by the end of the group stages. googletag.cmd.push Bellaghy have John McKeever at the helm this season, who has Leo Meenan in as coach with former minor selector Kieran Glackin on board and provides a vital link to the upcoming talents from their underage production line. With goalkeeper Benny Diamond stepping aside, one of McKeevers first tasks was to find a replacement. Former Derry minor list Peter Stuart, who is an accomplished kicker, has been moulded into the role and is set to start against Loup. The Tones, under Chairman Kevin Doherty, followed the lockdown to the letter of the law, but got a few challenge games in to help prepare them. googletag.cmd.push Conan Brown hasnt came out this year and another player who wont feature is Conor Quinn, who has suffered a nasty knee injury. Lorcan Spier will miss the first two games with a suspension carried over from last season. McKeever will need to keep captain Eoghan Brown fit, who will form a partnership with the highly rated Paul Cassidy, their Ulster minor winning captain, who has recovered from injury. Along with Ronan McFaul, Odhran Lee and Conan Milne, they could be set to make their debuts in a youthful Bellaghy team, who will look to Gerard ONeill and Ryan McNally, with Peter Cassidy and Declan Brown also having championship experience.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster Christian Helpline is listed in the Councils directory as a prayer line and last month distributed literature in the Magherafelt area branding homosexuality detestable onto God. The leaflet also called on those who participate in such immorality to repent and turn from their evil ways and included contact details for people to get in touch. Independent councillors Dan Kerr and Barry Monteith have also written to council management to ask that the listing be removed because it may promote conversion therapy. googletag.cmd.push The incident is under investigation by the PSNI. A spokesperson for the council said the directory listings had been temporarily removed. The online directory offers local business and services a listing opportunity and any inclusion should not be considered as an endorsement by the Council for any goods or services provided by any organisation, they said. However, given the issue which has now arisen, the directory section where community and voluntary organisations have registered their details, has been temporarily removed to allow us to undertake a review of the provision of the service in line with our equality commitments, and to take advice as required. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There was a fast corner through a dip which we cut and there was a bang as we went over some stones. We didn’t think much of it as it’s not unusual to hear noises like that while cutting a corner. But slowly the engine began to lose oil and then the oil pressure light came on  metres from the finish of the stage, he added. googletag.cmd.push We stopped the engine and coasted over the finish but that was game over. It turned out that in the compression a stone punched through the sumpguard and holed the sump, causing the engine to lose all its oil. I could probably take that corner  times and it would never happen again, it was just a freak thing but when you’re trying that card is always in the deck I suppose. I’m really disappointed for the whole team after all the effort that went into the weekend, I know we would have been in contention for a decent result.” His next European Rally Championship event in Latvia in mid-August and Devine has another chance to show his speed on Italian tarmac this weekend at Rally di Alba, where he joins Kilreas Josh McErlean, the current Young Irish Driver of the Year. Rally di Alba will take place on Sunday, August  with the crews taking on three stages repeated three times with the total competitive mileage of the event coming in at just over km. Following the event Callum and Brian willhome to prepare for Rally Liepāja, the second round of the ERC. “Latvia is a loose surface event andthe year had gone to plan, I would have liked a little more loose surface experience in the Hyundai before this stage of the year but it is what it is”, added Devine. “After a non-score in Rome and the championship having less rounds this year, we’ll need to take points away from Latvia.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Oakleaf Lions will be only the second such club in Ulster, following the Titanic Tigers formation last year. “We are a group of Special Olympic volunteers and parents who are establishing a new Special Olympics club in the Oakleaf county delivering the Young Athlete programme,” read a statement on the clubs Facebook page. “It is all dependent on Covid-, but we are hoping to get a taster day between September and Christmas,” said Brian McGuigan, who has been working with Liam Oacuteg Hinphey on the venture. googletag.cmd.push “Then in the new year, we aim to have an hour session every week. At the minute, we are getting the word out there and are looking for athletes.” The programme is a play and sport activity for children from four to eight years of age with an intellectual disability. It introduces children to a wide iety of play activities in a familiar, supportive and fun environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed. It provides a flexible framework and versatile programme which can be successfully offered in a iety of settings from inidual family home, to classrooms to community club settings - all designed as an introduction to fundamental movement skills. googletag.cmd.push The benefits of physical activity and play go beyond sports. The programme helps children interact with each other and develop communication, learning and self-help skills. It also introduces children to the Special Olympics programme and their family members to a network of support as well as preparing children for future membership into Special Olympics clubs. One of the long-term benefit of the programme is the opportunity to involve children with intellectual disabilities before they reach the age of eight. This will foster future involvement and hopefully participation in lelong sport and physical activity. If you are a parent with a child between four-eight with an intellectual disability or you want to give up some time to help out contact Brianor Maeve .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He said the business has been in existence since , with the amount of birds at the site remaining the same.Mr Shields said the proposal is for a ldquomodern, environmentally friendly unit and explained that he finds himself in the ldquoridiculous situation where he is trying to reduce emissions from his site by  per cent.He said this is a figure which the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs agrees with, but planners are recommending that his proposal is refused, even though it is a government target to reduce emissions.ldquoWe are looking to create efficiencies on our farm so that we will be ableto market all our eggs locally, rather than rely on the wholesale market in England where the majority of our eggs are sent, he said in the letter to planners.ldquoThis new system would give signicant benefits locally in both environmental and economic terms. Ammonia levels would be reduced by up to  percent and we would be looking to employ extra people to help with the grading of eggs and deliver them locally.Mr Shields said that he can continue with the older system which will emit a lot more ammonia, which is something that the government is trying to reduce..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Shrigley children’s sports pitches due for repair scheme  ","story":"CHILDRENrsquoS sports pitches in Shrigley are to be upgraded.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to carry out the work has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.He has been lobbying for the upgrade in response to residentsrsquo concerns and is pleased that the football pitches used by young people who live in the village will be improved.Cllr Brown said that an existing boundary fence will be increased in height alongside the provision of additional netting to prevents stray footballs from ending up in neighbouring gardens.ldquoGoalposts will be painted and holes in the ground fixed as part of a general revamp to improve playing conditions, he said.ldquoFurthermore, no ball games will be allowed in the play park itself and new signage will be erected to reflect this.Cllr Brown said he was pleased that the local authority is open to improving the conditions of the pitch and also the additional measures to protect local houses.ldquoEspecially over summer, it is important for the younger members of our community to have adequate outdoor facilities where they can take part in sporting activities, he said.The Rowallane councillor added: ldquoI hope that the improved fence offers residents peace of mind as their properties and cars will no longer be subject to stray footballs.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information. It should also be publicised in the Outdoor Swimmer Magazine.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the council took a decision to close all seasonal facilities in Newcastle, including both outdoor pools, due to Covid-.She said the decision was considered in the councilrsquos emergency business plan tabled at the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee meeting on June  and ratied at the full council meeting last month.In relation to the reopening of the indoor swimming pool at the Down Leisure Centre, the spokeswoman said the local authority was currently considering recent announcements by the Northern Ireland Executive on the reopening of pools and health suites and in relation to spectators at outdoor facilities.She added: ldquoAt present, these facilities remain closed until further notice.ldquoThe council is taking a phased approach to the reopening of its leisure facilities to ensure the safety of both staff and customers.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11649271.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

At first, the most likely hypothesis was that this appeared to be gross inattention to detail of the sort not alien to Mrs Foster. This is the First Minister who did not read the RHI legislation she proposed, and who just six months ago claimed that a border poll could only be heldthe Secretary of State believed it could be won by nationalism – a claim not only factually wrong, but contrary to her own position in recent years. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...However, developments in recent days point to something more calculated,still partially inscrutable.Mrs Foster and Michelle O’Neill first discussed this bill publicly when they appeared before their department’s Assembly scrutiny committee on July . Two days later the draft bill was published.But it is now clear from ious sources that this was not the DUP simply accepting civil service advice without sufficient questioning – as former DUP spad Tim Cairns reasonably assumed had happened when questions were asked about the bill over the last three weeks.In fact, Mrs Foster’s key special adviser, Emma Little-Pengelly, had been working in detail on the bill for weeks, multiple sources have confirmed. More than that, the most controversial aspect of this bill – conferring greater power on ministers to take decisions without asking the Executive – does not appear to have emerged from Sinn Féin or the SDLP, parties for whom such a change would sit wholly in line with their longstanding policy.Nor is there evidence that it came from civil servants who were either ignorant of the fact that it was contrary to DUP policy or with their own agenda.Unfathomably, the DUP did not just acquiesce in a bill which undermines its historic policy, policy so important that it fought court cases to establish it in case law as well as statute it was driving the process.Two weeks ago, Justice Minister Naomi Long said on Twitter that “it was the DUP who argued against changes for planning being addressed in isolation”.A senior Executive source has confirmed what the Alliance leader had said is accurate and it was the DUP which argued for the legislation going far beyond planning and covering every minister.Indeed, Executive papers show that Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon first brought a paper to the Executive on May , making the case for getting the sole power to decide planning applications.For some reason, the DUP then intervened and rather than the legislation coming from the SDLP minister, it was decided that Stormont Castle would take charge of it.Over the month between late May and the end of June, a very dferent bill was put together – with Mrs Little-Pengelly taking a close interest as to how it was crafted.Given the seemingly inexplicable nature of the DUP’s actions – including Mrs Foster and other senior members defending the bill by deploying a claim about a ‘three-minister lock’ which was demonstrably wrong – inside and outside the DUP people have searched for some hidden meaning in what happened.Has Arlene Foster consciously changed DUP policy to get things done at the expense of republicans also getting things done Is the DUP using this to try to somehow try to undo the liberalisation of the abortion law Could the party be attempting to undermine or prevent aspects of the Brexit deal which it dislikes All of those questions presuppose that there is likely to be some coherent explanation behind a political leader acting in ways which are detrimental to their stated policies.However, none of those attempts to impose some hidden order on this seeming chaos stand up after even basic scrutiny. Anticlimactically, the evidence points to a more prosaic explanation involving incompetence, arrogance, and what many see as Mrs Foster’s central character flaw – a predisposition when she has erred to shun humility in favour of haughty insistence that she is right.A month ago Mrs Foster and Ms O’Neill appeared before a Stormont committee for  minutes of scrutiny of the bill. Their one argument for urgently ramming the bill through the Assembly under emergency provisions was that there was a backlog of big planning decisions which could not be taken in a legally safe way until the passage of the bill.But on Tuesday, just minutes before MLAs voted on the bill for the final time, junior minister Declan Kearney blew apart that justication. He said that eventhe bill was passed by MLAs, planning decisions could not be taken by Ms Mallon until the autumn or winter because there will also have to be a change to the ministerial code.Mr Kearney did not misspeak because when Ms Mallon’s department rejected his interpretation and insisted that it could take planning decisions immediately, Stormont Castle stood over what the junior minister had said.With its own sole justication for cutting scrutiny of the bill having disintegrated based on the evidence of Mrs Foster’s own department, she faced suspicion within the DUP as to the real reason that she had insisted on that course.But then on Thursday the First Minister spoke to the media for the first time .Planning was no longer even mentioned as a reason for speed. Instead, Mrs Foster set out an even more implausible explanation. She said the urgency was because “there had been a gap identied in relation to ‘signicantor controversial’ issues thatwe didn’t have a programme for government then those issues could be taken [sic] by ministers in their own department and there was no necessity to bring them to the Executive. And I was concerned about that, and this bill stops that from happening...[that] could have caused grave dficulties.”It was a breathtakingly nonsensical claim. Paragraph  of the Lord Chief Justice’s judgment in Buick – the case Mrs Foster cited for the bill – made clear that where there is no programme for government then signicant or controversial decisions must come to the Executive.On top of that, Mrs Foster and her junior minister Gordon Lyons had argued that the status quo made the bill necessary because almost any decision could be said to meet the separate ‘cross-cutting’ test and get called into the Executive.If it was so wide that almost any decision could be called in – so wide that Mrs Foster wanted it tightened – what possible decision could have resulted in a solo run the First Minister now retrospectively claims the bill was designed to stop The monumental errors she has made in explaining herself reveal Mrs Foster to have a profoundly deficient comprehension of this complex juncture of law and politics.But now the deed is done. Mrs Foster may or may not be present when the full implications of this hasty change are realised.The DUP was once known for its professionalism and hard-headed unsentimentality. But, having grown lazy due to the lack of challenge from the UUP, the party is now prepared to accept a leader whose arguments have become so intellectually incoherent and error-strewn that they don’t even convince many of her senior colleagues while others accept being whipped to vote against DUP policy.With Northern Ireland’s defining centenary year just five months away, the DUP has a decision to make about who will lead unionism.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Box Two is to recycle foil paper and boxes, food and drinks cans, aerosols and cartons such as milk containers and plastics also. Box Three is for cardboard, glass bottles and jars.Bryson Recycling saysadopted it could mean a jobs boost for the area as well as making recycling easier. The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Homeless man thanks NI town’s community for ‘kindness and support’Air ambulance takes motorcyclist to hospital after serious RTCNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
