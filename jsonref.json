The BBC is planning a series about Lister, played by Suranne Jones, called Gentleman JackAdorned with a rainbow border in a nod to the LGBT rainbow flag, it acknowledges Lister\u0027s celebration of \u0027marital commitment\u0027 at Holy Trinity Church.It has provoked outrage, with more than 2,000 people signing a petition calling for the tribute to be taken down.Petition organiser Julie Furlong said: \u0027Anne is an iconic figure to lesbians throughout West Yorkshire particularly.University apologises for \u0027racist and colonialist\u0027 posters...Students paint over Rudyard Kipling poem \u0027If\u0027 just a WEEK...Share this article\u0027This has quite rightly has offended and angered many people in York and West Yorkshire.\u0027A gender nonconforming woman can be many things because it only means that you do not conform to societal expectations. It has nothing to do with sexuality.\u0027Anne Lister was, most definitely, gender non-conforming all her life. She was also however, a lesbian.\u0027That is why she took vows with her girlfriend in that church, because they were in love with each other and wanted to express that same sex love - the very definition of lesbianism.\u0027          Controversial: A petition has been signed calling for the plaque to be taken down because it describes Lister as \u0027gender-nonconforming\u0027 rather than \u0027lesbian\u0027Calling for more signatures, she added: \u0027Don\u0027t let them erase this iconic woman from our history. Anne Lister was a lesbian.\u0027  York Civic Trust said in a statement: \u0027The intention of the plaque is to recognise the impact Anne Lister has had on so many people and to celebrate an important figure and moment in LGBT history.\u0027While we\u0027ve received many positive responses to the plaque, we are really sorry that there are also many people who feel let down by the plaque\u0027s wording.          The ceremony to mark the unveiling of the plaque on July 24 outside Holy Trinity Church in York, where Lister and her partner Ann Walker cemented their union in 1834\u0027The wording was shaped by several open consultations held with York\u0027s LGBT community. \u0027It was intended to highlight Anne Lister and Ann Walker\u0027s deep commitment to each other, to reflect Anne\u0027s gender-nonconforming presentation, to raise the profile of queer history and to celebrate an LBGT icon.\u0027The phrase \u0027gender-nonconforming\u0027 was not intended to be read as a replacement for the word \u0027lesbian\u0027.\u0027However, we understand and accept that it has been read in this way. We recognise that this has hurt people, and we apologise.\u0027We\u0027ve heard the criticism and we\u0027re open to the idea of updating the plaque in the near future.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Girl 13 wakes having wisdom teeth removed believing Kylie Jenner","story":"Emma, 13, from California wakes from having her wisdom teeth removed believing she is reality TV star Kylie Jenner\u0027I can\u0027t believe this,\u0027 she adds. \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\u0027Lying back in a dentist\u0027s chair, the girl begins to cry.

His mother is a professor of computer science at Deakin University.Venkatesh recalls having a ‘fairly normal suburban existence’ growing up, despite being a maths prodigy. As a child, he won medals in the physics and maths Olympiads before becoming the youngest person to study at the University of Western Australia at the age of 13.He went straight into second year after proving that he could answer all of the exam questions on first-year subjects.One of his earliest mentors, Professor Cheryl Praeger, described him as ‘extraordinary’.At 16, Venkatesh graduated with first-class honours in pure mathematics and went on to study at Princeton.His adviser there, Peter Sarnak, also praised Venkatesh for his ‘remarkable insights’, telling Quanta: ‘It was clear that it was just a matter of time before he was going to put things together in unusual ways.’          The Fields Medal winners pose for photos with some attendees during the opening ceremony of the 2018 International Congress of Mathematicians in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Aug 1, 2018However, Venkatesh told the site that he felt like he did not have ‘a happy time as a graduate student’.‘I didn’t really feel like… I had added something very original. I don’t think I got the sense out of graduate school that I can do research.’Venkatesh tackled feeling down by reading maths texts on subjects far removed from his field—a coping mechanism that turned out to be the key to finding out what sort of mathematician he really wanted to be. A lot of his work features insights from other areas of mathematics.Venkatesh is married to Sarah Paden, who is finishing her doctoral dissertation in musicology at Princeton, and the couple have two children.What did Akshay Venkatesh win the Fields Medal for?The International Mathematical Union awarded Akshay Venkatesh the Fields Medal for: ‘His synthesis of analytic number theory, homogeneous dynamics, topology, and representation theory, which has resolved long-standing problems in areas such as the equidistribution of arithmetic objects.’Venkatesh, however, was surprised at winning the prize. \u0027It’s very difficult to grasp that I’m one of them,\u0027 he told Quanta. He didn\u0027t expect to win because his work is conjectural, whereas the traditional Fields Medal winners are ones who have solved a famous problem. Who else won the Fields Medal 2018?   This year\u0027s prize was also awarded to three other mathematicians:  Italian Alessio Figalli from ETH Zurich, German Peter Scholze and Caucher Birkar, from Cambridge. Birkar is a Kurdish refugee who came to Britain who grew up in a Kurdish city in Iran to farmer parents. His 14-carat gold medal was reportedly stolen just minutes after he accepted it at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Brazil. Who is Emin Agalarov?

These are high-profile videos taunting and ridiculing the 12 World gang and referring to actual fights.‘They reference murders, stabbings, drug deals, as well as appalling attitude to women. The videos incite violence.’A month earlier, Mr Westwood was mentioned at the Old Bailey by Judge Nicholas Cooke QC, who said drill music was putting innocent people in ‘harm’s way’ as two gang members were convicted of murdering an innocent music producer following a feud played out in rap videos featured by the DJ.

A Met Police database that tracks more than 600 suspected gangsters across 1,100 YouTube clips, names 32 videos on his channel that potentially incite violence.The DJ, who hosted the BBC Radio 1 Rap Show for 20 years until 2013, earns money from advertising on the channel.It has amassed 388million views by broadcasting clips including hundreds of rap videos from mainstream stars and suspected gang members.Many that show suspected gang members in balaclavas making threats against rivals are still on YouTube.This year, the family of a murdered teenager accused Mr Westwood of glamorising knife crime after he recorded a video with a gang celebrating the killing. Abdullahi Tarabi, 19, was stabbed after being chased through a west London estate in daylight on April 11 last year.Two 17-year-olds defendants were cleared following an Old Bailey trial last October. Around the same time, Mr Westwood posted a music video he had recorded with a rap gang when they boasted that the victim ‘got splashed and I don’t feel sorry for his mum’.The victim’s mother, Fawziya Ahmed, said: ‘This is hurtful. I can’t believe someone would say that.’It is no longer on TimWestwoodTV, but the song, Pray For The Pagans, is still on YouTube.The victim’s sister, Muna Tarabi, added: ‘How have these boys been allowed to go on with Tim Westwood, who is promoting them on his TV channel?

The 57-year-old actor claims Eggert has been harassing his family in recent weeks\u0027I have taken five separate polygraph tests given by two highly renowned examiners\u0027 Baio announced at the conference in Woodland Hills.In each test he was asked the same set of questions five times:\u0027Did you have any kind of sexual contact with Nicole Eggert before she turned 18 years old?\u0027 \u0027Did you put your finger in Nicole Eggert\u0027s vagina before she was 18 years old?\u0027\u0027Have you ever threatened Nicole Eggert that she needed to keep your alleged sexual contact with her a secret?\u0027 \u0027Have you ever exposed for genitals to Alexander Polinsky?\u0027Baio answered \u0027No\u0027 to each of the questions and the tests returned results of \u0027no deception\u0027 in each, according to a report from The Blast.Polygraph testing is viewed as controversial in the legal community, with results rarely being deemed admissible in courts of law due to suspect reliability.    Baio asserted that multiple polygraph tests showed \u0027no deception\u0027 when he answered \u0027No\u0027 to questions regarding Eggert\u0027s allegations of molestation and sexual assaultsThis week Baio filed a police report claiming that Eggert had been harassing him and his family. His wife of more than a decade, Renee Sloan, stood by as he addressed the media Thursday, saying: \u0027I went to the police because I want this to end. It’s over.\u0027Baio said he had turned over all threatening correspondence to investigators, and said he didn\u0027t want his allegation that his accuser is lying \u0027to be interpreted as an indictment of anyone except Nicole Eggert and her co-conspirators.Scott Baio is cleared of molestation allegations after the...Share this article\u0027There\u0027s no coming back from what she did. No. You say anything you want about me. You can\u0027t come after my wife and my kid. You can\u0027t do that.\u0027Shortly after Eggert came out to accuse Baio of misconduct, the actor learned that his wife had been diagnosed with microvascular brain disease following years as a stuntwoman.   At the time Scott told The Blast: \u0027All we know is she must live as stress-free, depression free and anxiety free life as possible and a get good amount of sleep each night. This new disease can cause strokes and dementia.\u0027           Baio, pictured with Sloan and their daughter Bailey in 2015, said Thursday: \u0027You say anything you want about me. You can\u0027t come after my wife and my kid. You can\u0027t do that\u0027Regrettably the diagnosis was followed up by plenty of stress when Eggert filed a police report in February accusing Baio of sexually assaulting her on multiple occasions beginning in 1986 when she was 14 and he was 25.The abuse continued during their time on the set of Charles in Charge until she was 17, Eggert claims.  Under the current laws, there is no statue of limitations for cases where a minor is molested by an adult, but at the time of the alleged assaults by Baio, the statute was only three years. Eggert told TMZ in May she knew the new law wouldn\u0027t be applied retroactively and that the DA would not be able to prosecute Baio. \u0027However I also knew the importance of laying the groundwork for any future victims of Baio\u0027s that may come forward and to warn parents who might unknowingly allow their children to be alone with this molester.\u0027 A source told the website that officials in the DA\u0027s office found Eggert to be \u0027credible\u0027 and Baio\u0027s crimes were \u0027potentially prosecutable\u0027 were it not for the statute of limitation.  Baio has repeatedly denied that there is any truth to Eggert\u0027s claims.            Eggert said it all started when she was 14 back in 1986 on the set of Charles in Charge, the television show she worked on with Baio, who was then 25Eggert, a child actress who got her first big role in Rich And Famous in 1980, opened up about her relationship with Baio on Megyn Kelly in January.\u0027He immediately took to me and befriended me and earned my trust,\u0027 she said of the early days on Charles in Charge in 1987. \u0027And then he started expressing his love for me. And talking about marriage in the future.\u0027And then I was still 14, before my 15th birthday, we were at his house in his car in his garage. And he reached over and he penetrated me with his finger. And that is when the sexual touching and abuse started after that.\u0027She went on to claim that these incidents \u0027probably happened once a week\u0027 until she was 16, along with kissing and groping that she believes the pair\u0027s co-stars on the program saw at the time.Baio has firmly denied Eggert\u0027s allegations and said that the two did not engage in any sexual activity until she was of age.           Co-star Alexander Polinsky (center) also accused Baio of abuse. \u0027I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\u0027 Polinsky told reporters during a news conference alongside Eggert (left) and attorney Lisa Bloom (right)Eggert wasn\u0027t the only Charles in Charge cast member to accuse Baio of inappropriate conduct.Co-star Alexander Polinsky also accused Baio of abuse earlier this year.\u0027I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\u0027 Polinsky told reporters during a news conference alongside Eggert and attorney Lisa Bloom.He went on to allege that Baio once threw hot tea in his face, cut a hole in his dressing room door so he could expose himself to the youngster and even pulled down Polinsky\u0027s pants in front of 100 people on set one day. Polinsky also said he witnessed Baio behaving inappropriately toward Eggert.Baio has denied all of the allegations made by Eggert and Polinsky.\u0027Scott denies every single claim of inappropriate behavior and there is absolutely nothing when you examine the facts and the evidence and the claims that have been made - almost every one of them can be refuted with evidence,\u0027 a representative for Baio told Variety.Baio accused Eggert and Polinsky of embarking on a \u0027media tour\u0027 because they were \u0027hungry for publicity.\u0027D.A.

The 57-year-old actor claims Eggert has been harassing his family in recent weeks\u0027I have taken five separate polygraph tests given by two highly renowned examiners\u0027 Baio announced at the conference in Woodland Hills.In each test he was asked the same set of questions five times:\u0027Did you have any kind of sexual contact with Nicole Eggert before she turned 18 years old?\u0027 \u0027Did you put your finger in Nicole Eggert\u0027s vagina before she was 18 years old?\u0027\u0027Have you ever threatened Nicole Eggert that she needed to keep your alleged sexual contact with her a secret?\u0027 \u0027Have you ever exposed for genitals to Alexander Polinsky?\u0027Baio answered \u0027No\u0027 to each of the questions and the tests returned results of \u0027no deception\u0027 in each, according to a report from The Blast.Polygraph testing is viewed as controversial in the legal community, with results rarely being deemed admissible in courts of law due to suspect reliability.    Baio asserted that multiple polygraph tests showed \u0027no deception\u0027 when he answered \u0027No\u0027 to questions regarding Eggert\u0027s allegations of molestation and sexual assaultsThis week Baio filed a police report claiming that Eggert had been harassing him and his family. His wife of more than a decade, Renee Sloan, stood by as he addressed the media Thursday, saying: \u0027I went to the police because I want this to end.

You can\u0027t come after my wife and my kid.

And talking about marriage in the future.\u0027And then I was still 14, before my 15th birthday, we were at his house in his car in his garage. And he reached over and he penetrated me with his finger. And that is when the sexual touching and abuse started after that.\u0027She went on to claim that these incidents \u0027probably happened once a week\u0027 until she was 16, along with kissing and groping that she believes the pair\u0027s co-stars on the program saw at the time.Baio has firmly denied Eggert\u0027s allegations and said that the two did not engage in any sexual activity until she was of age.           Co-star Alexander Polinsky (center) also accused Baio of abuse. \u0027I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\u0027 Polinsky told reporters during a news conference alongside Eggert (left) and attorney Lisa Bloom (right)Eggert wasn\u0027t the only Charles in Charge cast member to accuse Baio of inappropriate conduct.Co-star Alexander Polinsky also accused Baio of abuse earlier this year.\u0027I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\u0027 Polinsky told reporters during a news conference alongside Eggert and attorney Lisa Bloom.He went on to allege that Baio once threw hot tea in his face, cut a hole in his dressing room door so he could expose himself to the youngster and even pulled down Polinsky\u0027s pants in front of 100 people on set one day. Polinsky also said he witnessed Baio behaving inappropriately toward Eggert.Baio has denied all of the allegations made by Eggert and Polinsky.\u0027Scott denies every single claim of inappropriate behavior and there is absolutely nothing when you examine the facts and the evidence and the claims that have been made - almost every one of them can be refuted with evidence,\u0027 a representative for Baio told Variety.Baio accused Eggert and Polinsky of embarking on a \u0027media tour\u0027 because they were \u0027hungry for publicity.\u0027D.A.

Thankfully, Peter Astbury’s award-wining health tech wristband now offers a stylish solutionPerimenopause – also known as the menopause transition – is experienced by millions of women every year. The months or years leading up to the menopause can have very similar symptoms to the menopause itself, although some of these symptoms may change or disappear over time. “The most common symptoms are hot flushes and night sweats, but there are also other symptoms that are less thought about,” explains Dr Louise Newson, who specialises in treating women going through the perimenopause and menopause. “Migraines, palpitations, memory problems, low mood, anxiety, joint pain, muscle stiffness, poor sleep, reduced libido,” she adds.It’s the more obscure symptoms – migraines, low mood, tiredness – that many women fail to identify as part of perimenopause, something Newson partly puts down to the “big taboo” of the menopause itself. This lack of knowledge can have a severe impact. Not realising that symptoms are part of a bigger picture, many women fail to seek appropriate treatment. Newson cites examples of patients who falsely believe their memory loss is due to dementia, or who are incorrectly prescribed high doses of antidepressants by doctors who haven’t taken hormonal changes into account. But there may be other options. The Perimenopause Challenge is a category in the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Awards that aims to find technologies that can help women track the symptoms of perimenopause – enabling them to get better support and information. The Grace Wristband, developed by designer Peter Astbury and 2018 winner of the category, operates by easing one of the worst symptoms of the perimenopause – hot flushes. At the onset of a hot flush, says Astbury, the hypothalamus (the part of the brain that regulates body temperature) is falsely triggered. The Grace Wristband contains a set of sensors that detect this reaction, activating a “cooling tile” that delivers “intense cooling to the wrist”. The goal is to “use this sensation to signal to the hypothalamus that the body should retain heat” – a response directly opposite to a hot flush. This could, says Astbury, prevent women from waking up in the night with hot flushes, alleviating many of the sleep-related issues faced during perimenopause. Astbury describes one woman going through perimenopause who, waking up sweating 15 or 20 times a night, would get up and run her wrists under cold water to cool down. “I realised at that point that creating a product that could deal with night sweats was just as important as helping with hot flushes during the day,” he says. Astbury started developing Grace when he was just 22 and attending Loughborough University – a time when, perhaps unsurprisingly, he knew “next to nothing about menopause”.During his research, Astbury heard stories from many women – and it was these that left the biggest impression. “I regularly receive messages from women desperate to be involved as research participants so they can use Grace as soon as possible,” he says. As Newson – who was one of the judges for the Perimenopause Challenge category – points out, women’s health issues are not always discussed in an open or comfortable way something Astbury hopes will change.“In the UK, and the west in general, we have developed an environment where people don’t feel comfortable talking about things like perimenopause because of associations with ageing,” he says. “Many cultures don’t suffer from the same taboos as us – one study of Mayan culture found that the menopause was associated with freedom and status, and was therefore a positive milestone in life.”The design of the wristband, says Astbury, is an attempt to break down this stigma. “The aim is for women to wear Grace with confidence – the hope is that more people will feel they can openly talk about menopause.” Astbury is hopeful that a change is taking place: “Women are increasingly talking openly about menopause and its effects,” he says. “I hope that this change gains traction and that our culture continues to evolve and become more and more open about all health-related topics.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

At Bocketts Farm in Surrey, she was minding her one-year-old and newborn baby when another mother came running past, frantically searching for her more mobile six-year-old. He had wandered off on his own, no one knew where he’d got to, and there was no way to contact him. Wong thought: “Why can’t we be more connected to our younger children?”Enter the Gator Watch, a wearable tracking device with call functionality for kids who are too young for a smartphone but old enough to want a little more independence. Wong had researched her idea and found that while there were similar products already on the market in other countries, such as China, there was nothing quite like this. And nothing at all in the UK: the market was desperate for something that filled this communication gap for five- to 10-year-old children. “When I talk to parents, everyone is in agreement,” says Wong. “No one wants to give their kid a smartphone before secondary school, they just feel there’s nothing in the market for what they want, which is pure connection.”The watch can make and receive calls from 13 trusted numbers, it has an SOS button, and if your child wanders beyond defined safe zones you’re alerted as it happens. After eight months working with a manufacturer, Wong brought the watch to market, and this year her company, Techsixtyfour, which is staffed by working mums, won the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award for the Staying Independent with Tech Challenge. The category was set up to discover technologies that facilitate monitoring and emergency contact between caregivers and their charges.Last Christmas, Dave Housley bought the watch for his son Freddie, an eight-year-old kart-racing driver who spends a lot of time travelling to and from races: clocking up hundreds of miles is not an unusual way to spend a weekend for the Housley family. “At a kart race weekend, the kids are outside, they’re playing in the woods and doing stuff that kids should do. With this watch, we’ve got more confidence to let them do that because we can track them and we can get hold of them. It gives us a lot more confidence to let a kid be a kid in today’s world it gives you more confidence in letting them out of your sight.” The watch fulfils Housley’s need to know his son is safe, and it also works for Freddie. “He loved the whole concept of it,” says Housley. “It has that element of fun to it. He’s talking into it like it’s a James Bond watch.”The device has been a roaring success, and not only for reasons Wong predicted. It was always her plan to have the watch disconnected from the internet and social media, simply because she felt children should be able to have a childhood away from the glow of screens. But it wasn’t until she heard a policeman’s feedback that she realised it was solving a much bigger, and newer, societal problem.“He had bought the watch for his eight-year-old daughter because they live on an estate, and he was just afraid for his daughter to go outside,” she says. “But as a police officer, he knows that it’s far more dangerous for a child to stay at home and play on their screens. Parents might fear that allowing their children to go outside would mean they’d get kidnapped, but the amount of danger online is actually far higher – that parents are getting this wrong has been an eye-opener.”Wong has also found another vital use for the Gator Watch: helping older people. Ingrid Ehrlich’s husband, now 85, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s two years ago. “A year and a half ago he went for the newspaper,” says Ehrlich. “He did it every morning, and one day he didn’t come back. It was an hour before he went into the newsagent and bought the paper. Nobody can find out what he did in that hour.”Since getting the watch, Ehrlich has stopped locking the doors of the house in case her husband wanders off. He comes and goes as he pleases, while she monitors a map on her computer. “It’s the only thing he does on his own, so I encourage it. He just feels that he has much more freedom.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

Robert and his entourage of soldiers, who are all due to leave the city the next day, drink, quote Baudelaire and debate “the dirty trade of war”.“I did it to save the lives of people who had not hired out to fight,” the narrator explains. “There was that and the fact that I had learned to know and love an infantry ision and wished to serve it in any useful way I could … I also loved France and Spain next to my own country. I loved other countries too but the debt was paid and I thought that the account was closed, not knowing the accounts are never closed.”Hemingway had a particular fondness for Paris’s Ritz hotel, which also appears in The Sun Also Rises. In 1944, as the German occupying forces fled Paris, Hemingway, who was working as a war correspondent, arrived at the hotel in a Jeep with a group of soldiers and announced to the staff that he was there to liberate them – but was informed that the German dignitaries who had been occupying the building had already left. Hemingway then commandeered the bar and ordered champagne for everyone.“When I dream of afterlife in heaven, the action always takes place in the Paris Ritz,” Hemingway would later say.With other Hemingway papers, A Room on the Garden Side has been housed in the Library of Congress and the John F Kennedy library in Massachusetts.Six decades after it was written, A Room on the Garden Side is set to be published in the summer edition of the Strand magazine, a literary quarterly that has previously published obscure works by the likes of Raymond Chandler, John Steinbeck and HG Wells.“Hemingway’s deep love for his favourite city as it is just emerging from Nazi occupation is on full display, as are the hallmarks of his prose,” Strand managing editor Andrew F Gulli writes in an editorial note introducing the story.Kirk Curnutt, a board member of the Hemingway Society, wrote in an afterword that “the story contains all the trademark elements readers love in Hemingway”.“Steeped in talk of Marcel Proust, Victor Hugo, and Alexandre Dumas, and featuring a long excerpt in French from Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du Mal, the story implicitly wonders whether the heritage of Parisian culture can recover from the dark taint of fascism,” Curnutt wrote.War was a longtime muse for Hemingway. He worked as an ambulance driver during the first world war, drawing upon his experiences in A Farewell to Arms. The Spanish civil war inspired For Whom the Bell Tolls. He was both soldier and correspondent during the second world war, reporting on Paris’s liberation from Nazi occupation in August 1944 for Collier’s magazine.Numerous works were left unpublished after Hemingway killed himself in 1961. A Moveable Feast, his memoir of life in Paris in the 1920s, was published in 1964, three years after his death. Novels Islands in the Stream and The Garden of Eden were published in 1970 and 1986 respectively, and his non-fiction account of bullfighting The Dangerous Summer came out in 1985.During the last decade of his life, Hemingway wrote many other short stories set during the second world war. In August 1956, he told his publisher Charles Scribner Jr that he had completed five: A Room on the Garden Side, Black Ass at the Cross Roads, Indian Country and the White Army, The Monument, and The Bubble Reputation. Until now, only Black Ass at the Cross Roads had been published."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a32dbd55bf3aea1718ca5c0436d883afb2ff13e5/29_200_3458_2075/master/3458.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=131eee6dc14d25868f00d197bb8ceb93","title":"bank of england raises interest rates","story":"Monetary policy committee lifts cost of borrowing to highest level since 2009The Bank of England has raised interest rates above the emergency level introduced after the financial crisis despite mounting fears about the economic impact of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, told businesses and households there would be further increases in borrowing costs if economy continued to recover from a softer patch earlier this year, but he also signalled willingness to reverse the quarter-point increase in the event of a disorderly Brexit.Charles Hepworth of the City investment management company GAM said: “The Bank of England’s response in a few months’ time could look very different should the Brexit cliff edge slip nearer despite them saying more hikes will be needed.”In delivering its verdict on Thursday, the Bank’s nine-member monetary policy committee voted unanimously for the increase, judging that the economy had bounced back from the effects of the “beast from the east” earlier this year.The MPC said recent readings for economic growth “appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary, with momentum recovering in the second quarter”.The Bank’s decision, only the third change in interest rates in the last decade, comes as fears mount over Brexit, with Theresa May facing parliamentary isions over her plan.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the rate rise would be bad news for hard-pressed households: “Given recent revelations that households are spending more than they receive in income for the first time since 1988, today’s rise will be a blow to those facing high levels of personal debt.”Business groups also criticised the decision given the mounting Brexit uncertainty which, along with higher borrowing costs, stood to deter firms from investing in Britain. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “The decision to raise interest rates, while expected, looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy.”There has been some better news for the economy in recent months, with the summer heatwave and royal wedding giving the country a shot in the arm by encouraging a rise in consumer spending. Inflation has fallen from its highest level in five years, and unemployment remains at its lowest level since the mid-1970s. Factory output has slowed, however, as global economic growth softens and Donald Trump slaps import tariffs on some of the US’s biggest trading partners, including the EU and China. Despite the low levels of unemployment in the UK, pay rises for British workers remain elusive. Having previously delayed raising interest rates in May, preferring to wait and see if the economy would recover, the decision had been widely expected this time. The unanimous vote is likely to stoke speculation that further increases are around the corner.

Indeed, I’d like to pick a fight with the blandness of the questions asked in Ofcom’s latest telecommunications report. I wish they’d included: “Have you ever picked up your phone to Google where your phone is?” Or: “Have you ever smashed or otherwise been suddenly deprived of your phone, and wanted to stand in the street howling like a wolf?”Etiquette is underdeveloped in the world of the smartphone: there are people to whom sending six questions in six separate texts is itself rude and will call instead to solve the whole lot in a conversation there are other people to whom this is horrible manners, since you should always stick to the medium via which you were contacted, unless explicitly invited to move to a different one. This tribalism has to be resolved, so we all know where we are. I once swapped media and personnel, replying to an email I had from one half of a couple with a phone call to the other. This was agreed to be the rudest thing that had ever happened.It is commonly assumed that extroverts like phone calls and introverts like texting, but this isn’t necessarily the case: introverts tend to develop techniques for phone calls – a special voice, pacing about – which act like armour and allow all the communicative benefits of conversation without actually having to meet. Extroverts often prefer a face-to-face because they find it energising. There are people who genuinely love talking for hours over the phone – siblings, my plumber – but the true chat constituency was always adolescents, trying to escape their families by ing into the company of the intimates they’d chosen.Digital natives probably wouldn’t understand a phone call of the olden days meandering, one-on-one, hours long. The classic familial row of the 1980s – how much it had just cost for you to talk about nothing to a person you’d spent all day at school with – would be completely alien, with phone calls almost free and conversations seeming curiously thin unless there are six people in them. The slightly older native, say a millennial, seems a bit chary of the voice call: they text in advance to schedule them, or if they ring unannounced, start by apologising. The phonee in this scenario (as in, the person receiving the call not the phoney) is the person whose liberty has been encroached upon.Contrast that with the older phone user, the over-65, who will run to pick up a call regardless of what they’re doing, as if whatever random person who has got in touch them is automatically more important than whoever’s in front of them, by dint of … well, who knows what this dint is? Nobody understands it. Perhaps one of them would like to explain.It is always easier to have a tricky conversation by text or email, or you think it is: what you’ve forgotten is how quickly, once discord has been established, it will escalate when using the written word. It is far more difficult to be a jerk in person, even from a distance, which is why phone calls can seem harder (often, all you want is to be a jerk) but are in fact easier (situations that are resolved in the moment without a trail of insult are gentler on the soul. Not always, just usually).The other great disincentive is the voicemail: there’s nobody left on Earth who listens to them, but everyone has a recorded message insisting that they will. By the time you’ve called someone and found them unavailable, you’ve already invested all that finger energy so you’re damned if you’re going to revert to a text. This will ultimately be the end of the voice call, as we all confront that aching cacophony millions of messages, floating in an unreal space, never to be heard, like some communicative dystopia dreamed up by Beckett (Samuel, not Margaret). If you’re a phone person, this is the end of your era. Make the most of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c72cae4117e7490761e3c20faa9a08b8f103b57/0_94_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=631c807610ac2a04340b79b48d0a6f6a","title":"theresa may brexit referendum","story":"Amid the Brexit fog there is at least\u0026nbspclarity on one point. Theresa May is trapped. There is no parliamentary majority for her Chequers plan. Michel Barnier has indicated opposition to key elements from the EU perspective, again this week ruling out her white paper’s proposal for a free trade in goods, and warning against any attempt by her to undermine the European single market. If there are changes to May’s plan, these will move further towards the wishes of the EU and further away from the hardline Brexiteers in her parliamentary party.Such a move is unlikely to secure the support of the Labour leadership, which is disinclined to dig a dysfunctional government out of a deep hole. Parliamentary paralysis this autumn is likely, with a majority of MPs also opposed to the UK crashing out without a deal.One way through the obstacles is a referendum posing at least three options. They would include remaining in the EU, no-deal or May’s deal. Personally,\u0026nbsp I support such a proposition and I hope it happens. But I am not prime minister. May is prime minister and probably will be this autumn as she seeks to navigate a way through. May will not back such a referendum.She has argued with some justification that the referendum in 2016 decided that the UK would leave the EU. Parliament voted to hold the wretched 2016 referendum by an overwhelming majority. Both main parties entered last year’s general election pledging to leave. She has left herself no wriggle room. She will not hold a referendum that challenges the 2016 verdict.If she is removed as prime minister, a successor would probably\u0026nbspbe even less inclined to provide the space for such a referendum. Yet May does have another option, a game-changer that could see her and the UK through this nightmare. She could offer a referendum on her final deal with the EU, with the other option being no-deal. Such a move does not challenge the 2016 verdict but would be a sequel to it. The UK is leaving, but the people would decide on what terms. There could be no screaming from the rooftops that the “elite” is depriving “the people” of its choice made in 2016.A referendum on a Brexit deal versus no-deal could offer her an escape from hell. She would be in a position to negotiate a softer deal with the EU without worrying about her parliamentary party going bonkers, or whether Labour would back her in parliament (it will not do so). The people would decide.Such a proposition is not great for any faction, but nor is it dire either. Quite a few leading remainers accept that the UK is leaving, but seek a sensible deal. May will be freer to negotiate such a deal without the pressure of having to please her hardliners in parliament.Those of us who would prefer the UK to stay in the EU would at least avoid three possibilities: losing another inout referendum triggering the rise of the far right if remain were to win and fuelling even more intense anger against the EU in the future.Indeed, we remainers would be the angry ones, but\u0026nbspwith one enduring hope. If voters support a relatively\u0026nbspsoft Brexit, the chances of rejoining in the future are high.For the hardline Brexiteers, May presents them with two gifts if she follows such a course: a referendum that accepts the UK is leaving the EU and the chance for them to put the case for no-deal. No doubt some of them\u0026nbspwould claim that they would have negotiated a better deal by acting more robustly in negotiations. May\u0026nbsphas the perfect rejoinder: there is nothing tougher than threatening no-deal. Her referendum would pose such a threat.The advantages for May in making such a move are overwhelming. She bypasses the parliamentary paralysis. She forces those who waffle about the benefits of no-deal to focus more clearly on the implications. She could negotiate a more workable soft Brexit option than her convoluted Chequers white paper, which has already failed its tests in terms of domestic politics and the reaction of the EU.There is an obvious risk that no-deal wins such a referendum and the UK hurtles over the cliff, led by triumphant hardline rightwingers. But that risk applies anyway. Given the thumbs down to May’s Chequers plan, there is much talk at Westminster of the UK tumbling out of Europe without a deal.Putting any vote to the people in these wild times is not easy, but I suspect when voters are faced with the more detailed consequences and realities of no-deal, and without having the excuse of complaining about a perceived elite forcing them to remain in the EU, the majority would be against crashing out.The people would have made their Brexit choice, and hardline Brexiteers would have to calm down for a year or two. If I were Theresa May, I would return from my latest walking holiday in Italy and change everything by proposing a referendum – but the choice on offer would be either a newly negotiated deal with the EU, of which her battered Chequers plan will play a face-saving part, or no-deal.She knows the latter will be calamitous and will oppose it sincerely. No Brexiteer can shout betrayal, the emotive term that fuels angry support for hardliners. I would prefer us to stay in the EU – but this is Theresa May’s only way out.• Steve Richards is a political columnist and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e684191b43a9149cc1c12b7b8c206cd942a0fac/0_232_2644_1586/master/2644.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49819b5bffd1d23b631614401c6458dd","title":"student loans company spied on vulnerable students social media","story":"Exclusive: Support workers say estranged students lost funding despite no finding of guilt of fraudThe Student Loans Company (SLC) has been accused of spying on the social media accounts of vulnerable students as part of an anti-fraud drive that resulted in some losing funding and dropping out of university despite no finding of guilt against them.SLC made a random selection of 150 estranged students, part of a group recognised as vulnerable because they have no relationship with their parents and tend to be financially disadvantaged, and asked them to provide evidence that they no longer had contact with their families.According to charity workers now supporting some of the students affected, if they failed to respond within 28 days with the required proof their funding was suspended and in some cases their social media accounts were monitored to try to find out if there had been any contact with parents.Minutes of an SLC meeting seen by the  said 81 of the 150 had funding withdrawn. That figure has since fallen as cases have been resolved, but campaigners say the affected students, many of whom have mental health problems, have suffered enormous stress and hardship.Becca Bland, the chief executive of Stand Alone, a charity that supports estranged people, said affected students had the third and final instalment of their maintenance and fee loans suspended. Some had to wait five months to have it reinstated, leading to extreme poverty, homelessness, defaults on tenancy agreements and a deterioration in their mental health.She described the anti-fraud exercise as ill-considered and heavy-handed. “Stand Alone understands the need to monitor fraud within the student population, but the vulnerabilities and characteristics of young adults who are estranged from their family must be taken into consideration in processes.“Students who are estranged from family suffer from extreme financial disadvantage whilst studying at university as they don’t have family support, and may have mental health difficulties linked to abuse, neglect or rejection from their family or the time they may have spent in the care system.“In this exercise, the actions of this fraud investigation have had negative consequences on students, who have had their funding cut off for many months, have been forced into homelessness or sofa surfing, and in some cases have dropped out of university.“It is both ethically and practically unacceptable to cut off a vulnerable student’s maintenance loan and fee loan prior to finding a student guilty of fraud. The idea of a financial institution monitoring a random sample of students’ social media to determine their family relationships is unsettling, and an invasion of their privacy.”James Smith, 20, quit his studies after his funding was suspended as a result of the fraud investigation. He denies doing anything fraudulent and feels that he has been treated like a criminal. He said he had been left with no choice but to give up his place studying zoology at Salford University, ending his dream of opening an animal sanctuary.He said the SLC had picked through his Facebook account in an attempt to find evidence of contact with his family, and had leapt to the wrong conclusions after finding a five or six word post. “I’m dropping out of university now. I’m not strong enough to be honest.,” he said. “I can’t even find the words to tell you how it’s made me feel. It’s been an absolute nightmare. My house mates were worried when they saw me not eating and not sleeping. It’s all I think about. It’s had a dramatic effect on me. I feel like I’ve been persecuted.” An SLC spokesperson said that as a result of the anti-fraud exercise one student had had all funding removed after submitting a fraudulent estrangement letter, five students would no longer receive the additional estrangement element of their funding, three voluntarily withdrew their application for estrangement funding before the process started and one withdrew during the process.“There are currently 34 students who have not yet responded to our requests for information and, as a result, we have withheld the third instalment of their maintenance and fee loans,” the spokesperson said. “We would ask them to please call us on 0141 243 3324 as soon as possible to allow us to review their evidence and future funding.”Stand Alone has called for an urgent review of the investigation and the reinstatement of funding to those who have been cut off without any proof of fraud.A spokesperson for the National Union of Students said: “The number of students applying for estrangement status is low and at every opportunity the SLC should remain sensitive to the situation these students find themselves in and refrain from overzealous responses.“It is also critical that appropriate means of communication and language are used and that students are directed to sources of support to avoid confusion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb6a4bf355970b8edffc486ae26c6d38a53089f/0_40_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=490b1dc82907f7c29ad553ec04969258","title":"5500 uk churches switch to renewable energy","story":"Churches estimated to have erted £5m from fossil fuels to clean energy providersMore than 5,500 churches including some of the UK’s most famous cathedrals have converted to renewable power to help tackle climate change.Fifteen Anglican cathedrals including Salisbury, Southwark, St Albans, Liverpool, Coventry and York Minster are among the buildings signed up to green electricity tariffs.Church leaders said climate change was “one of the great moral challenges of our time” and hurt the poor first and worst.With the average annual church electricity bill around £1,000, British churches have erted more than £5m from fossil fuels to clean energy providers, it is estimated.Other churches have made the move through the Big Church Switch campaign run by the Christian charities Christian Aid and Tearfund and the Church of England’s environment programme.Parishes can sign up with the national church buying group 2buy2, which pools the combined buying power to negotiate the cheapest possible tariff. Christian Aid said the renewable energy tariff was often cheaper than the fossil fuel-dominated one they had been on before.Nicholas Holtam, the bishop of Salisbury and the Church of England’s lead bishop on the environment, said: “It’s fantastic to see churches doing their bit to ensure they reduce their impact on the environment. They are also giving a boost to clean energy, which is essential to reduce harmful carbon emissions.“Climate change is an enormous injustice and is hurting the poor first and worst. Switching to responsible sources of electricity may seem like a small thing on its own, but when joined together it can make a real difference.”Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury and the chair of Christian Aid, said the Church of England had agreed to sell its shares in fossil fuel companies not on track to meet the aims of the Paris agreement on tackling climate change.“Churches are part of a global network and so are often very aware of the plight of our brothers and sisters suffering from droughts, floods and extreme weather around the world,” he said.He urged the government to set a target to cut UK emissions to zero by 2050 to ensure Britain “remains a green and pleasant land at home and a climate leader abroad”.

The Home Office is killing our world music scene – and it’s going to get worseThe UK has long been a leading destination for discovering sounds from far-flung corners of the globe, whether it is Malian songbird Oumou Sangaré’s set at Glastonbury, or the shadowy South African electro of DJ Lag in a sticky-floored club in London. But last weekend, that reputation was thrown into disarray following comments by Womad organiser Chris Smith, who lambasted the UK’s oppressive visa restrictions on world music artists. Three of the acts scheduled for the festival – Sabry Mosbah from Tunisia, Wazimbo from Mozambique and some of the members of Niger’s Tal National – were denied entry to the UK and either had to cancel their festival appearance or perform stripped-down sets. Indian duo Hashmat Sultana passed through border control 24 hours after they were due to go on stage. Smith said that an increasing number of performers were now declining invitations to the event because they deemed the Home Office’s iron-fisted process humiliating.Questions have been raised about what this means for the future of world music in the UK. The festival’s co-founder, Peter Gabriel, this week released a statement calling the situation “alarming” and asked: “Do we really want a white-breaded, Brexited flatland? A country that is losing the will to welcome the world?” Channel 4 News’s Jon Snow, meanwhile, tweeted: “The ‘hostile environment’ took its toll at Womad … a number of events were seriously affected by visa refusals. By definition, a festival of world music requires visas for many bands. What on Earth is the Home Office doing refusing them? Is music the new enemy?”From booking agents and gig promoters to festival curators and artists themselves, many have had disheartening experiences trying to bring esteemed musicians into the country. Each time, they must navigate a confusing matrix of box-ticking processes via outsourced application centres only for a visa to be refused regardless, causing gigs to be cancelled at the last minute and money lost.“It’s definitely the toughest country to enter,” says Ben Makkes, manager for the 82-year-old Ghanaian highlife pioneer Ebo Taylor, denied a visa last year despite playing in the UK many times during his 60-year career. During his application, the visa office kept his band’s passports for weeks, meaning they couldn’t travel elsewhere in Europe, missing vital shows. “There was no communication, no help whatsoever,” says Makkes. “The reason they eventually gave us was insufficient funds on accounts, even though my company had stated that we would cover all costs. In the end we lost €20,000 (£17,000) in flights and fees, and I don’t think we’ll come back to the UK because of that.”That despair is reiterated by many artists abroad. The Serbian DJ Tijana T told dance music site Resident Advisor she felt “like a criminal” after having her UK visa denied three times last year. Booking agent Clementine Bunel agrees that artists find it “demoralising”, while Seun Kuti, son of Afrobeat legend Fela, said on the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire show last week: “What we musicians go through is hell”.The UK visa process for entertainers does indeed sound like a gift from Satan himself. It is eye-wateringly complex, costly (£245 slow-track much more for premium fast-track) and certainly not user-friendly. Steve Richard, of entertainment specialists T\u0026ampS Immigration Services, explains that applicants must fill out an online form, containing sections that are “not entirely clear”, followed by a personal appearance at a visa application centre. “Some people will live near a VAC but many won’t, particularly in Africa,” says Richard. “Applicants from Mali, for example, have to travel to Dakar in Senegal for their nearest VAC”, and trips such as these, which can be about 1,000 miles each way, for 15 band members can cost several thousand pounds.“It’s an absolute scandal,” says Paul Duhaney, director of Liverpool’s annual Africa Oyé festival. “It’s like me having to go to the USA, but going to Moscow to get my visa. I just wouldn’t do it. So why are we expecting African artists, or artists from anywhere for that matter, to go to another country for interviews?”Performers invited by a number of approved events such as Womad (there are 45 in the UK in total) can apply for a permit-free festival visitor visa without the need to issue a certificate of sponsorship. But they must “provide bank statements showing a consistent balance of around £1,000 for at least three months,” says Richard. Even these visas are clearly no longer guaranteed, often due, according to David Jones, a director at live music producer Serious, to spiralling processing times. “What used to be the absolute maximum period they would turn the visa around in, 15 working days, has become the norm.” Often this means that passports are returned long after a gig has taken place.According to Richard, visa officers “don’t always appreciate that the simple fact an artist is popular in the UK is reason enough that they should want to do a show here”. Duhaney agrees: many of these bands have “played to 40,000 people in their own country. It’s like Robbie Williams going to Ghana and they’re saying: ‘Who are you? Not really sure we can let you in, mate.’” These refusals seem to be more common than ever in the past year, adds Richard. And it is taking its toll on event programming.“We have four bands on reserve just in case of last-minute visa issues, because it happens every year. It’ll happen in the years going forward,” says Duhaney. “This could seriously affect all UK festivals, if this continues.”Alison Phipps, a language professor at Glasgow University and a Unesco chair in refugee integration, says: “It is an extraordinarily difficult thing to bring a musician into the country,” and that “undoubtedly, since 2015, it has got considerably harder”. In 2017, she booked 22 musicians and dancers from Ghana to perform as part of a £2m UK government-funded academic project at Solas festival. At first, 20 were denied visas. “We’ve done this in the past and we’ve never had a problem,” says Phipps, but this time “they received letters and refusals saying that the Home Office did not believe that they were musicians, that they were working with me on this project. We’re funded by the government to do this work, and then the same government refuses us permission to do it.”After appealing, with the help of her local MPs, all but two of Phipps’s invitees were let in. But not before flights had been rebooked for thousands of pounds. Whether it is official or not, Phipps says, “there is a travel ban in place in the UK. What I see constantly is that if you are from the global south, you will be refused almost invariably.”Brian d’Souza, who performs as the musician Auntie Flo, met one of the key collaborators on his next album, Senegal’s Mame n’Diack Seck Thiam, while in Amsterdam. One of their tracks, Mame’s Story, details Seck Thiam’s difficulties getting a visa to perform at a BBC World Service event at the 2017 Edinburgh International festival.“There seems to be a very colonialist attitude when it comes to presuming underlying motivations for the artists I’m trying to book,” says d’Souza. “It’s saying: ‘If they come to the UK, they’ll just end up staying.’ But most of the artists I’ve ever worked with are here to do a job, and then they’re quite happy to go back to their own homes they’re not desperate to come and live in the UK. They are performers, they’re not trying to emigrate.” Examples such as the nine members of the Orchestra of Syrian Musicians, granted asylum in 2017, are in a minority. Most musicians’ work is rooted in where they live, and they have no desire to move – something underlined by often decades of touring without any attempt at illegal immigration.Was Jon Snow right, then, when he said that the hostile environment is in effect for touring musicians? “Perhaps, but it’s hard to say this is deliberate,” says Richard. “From how we see it, most of these problems seem to stem from their processes not working very efficiently.” Jones also suggests that it is down to administrative incompetence, as a result of cost-cutting. “I don’t think there’s someone sitting inside the immigration authority who’s going: ‘Let’s be racist,’” says Jones. “But instead of being a system that isn’t quite working in the face of government cutbacks, and it’s just bumbling inefficiency and a nuisance, it’s become something that’s been perceived in a different light. Because of Brexit and belligerent statements about ‘reclaiming our borders’. Really, this process has been eroding over time.”Brexit rhetoric might not help Britain’s image as a cultural nexus. But how it will exacerbate the current climate for touring musicians – as well as artists of all other kinds – remains to be seen. Richard says it is unlikely to affect those from countries already on the visa list, but what about those from the EU? A recent report published on 26 July by the House of Lords’ European committee about the movement of people in the cultural sector suggested that the government should offer a “multi-country, multi-entry, short-term touring visa for EU citizens,” and vice versa. But changes have already started to come into play on some borders – and without warning. American artists who would once fly to Ireland to play shows and then go on to the UK without an entry visa now require one to enter the UK, says Richard, “whereas if they enter from any other country, they just need a paper permission, not a visa”.What it could mean for the future, he continues, is that “non-EU acts are less likely to play shows in Ireland. Bands may deem that slotting a Dublin show into their tour is too troublesome.”While Jones estimates that fewer tours are likely to be undertaken in the UK by artists needing visas, he says that he won’t be discouraged from booking them. “That sense of keeping international links wide open has never felt more important in my lifetime.” He says a solution would be simply to “trust” the festivals on the permit-free list who have signed up to take responsibility for the artists they have invited to Britain. Others suggest a specialist for the entertainment sector within the Home Office who can distinguish between genuine and non-genuine acts, and an independent organisation who can advise on forms.If the current situation is not reviewed and improved, however, “everything is going to get a lot harder”, says Phipps. “The UK will be isolated.” Artists, she says, “bring us in to a relationship with difference. They play a line of music we’ve not heard before and we welcome it and our lives are enriched – and then we begin to learn it and then we sing it. What we are doing with Brexit, with the closing of the borders, with all of this focus on a hostile environment, is trying to make our lives dull and stupid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46fb8c0877d3f91570126c2bc91b88e2fa1da4d/0_1784_3641_2184/master/3641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a995b3b038e3c88cb9d1122bb2a1cbdb","title":"meriel armitages recipe for jackfruit carnitas","story":"Get your hands dirty with these vegan-friendly treats inspired by offerings found in Mexico CityMexican food is all about using your hands, piling up a lot of napkins on the table and getting messy – it takes the formality out of hosting dinner parties and saves on the washing up.

But, she says, Britain doesn’t quite get itRihanna puckered up to it on Instagram. Nicki Minaj remixed it. Migos crooned along to it. Eighteen months after its release, south London singer Ella Mai’s infectious single, R\u0026ampB throwback Boo’d Up, has gone from being a sleeper hit to the US-conquering song of the summer – last week she became the first British artist to top the US R\u0026ampB charts since Lisa Stansfield in 1992.But when asked to pinpoint a standout moment from her song’s rise to US radio dominance, Mai’s response is decidedly level-headed. “It’s the way it’s steadily progressed,” she says, speaking from LA. She giddily reels off chart positions in the song’s ascent to its current eight-week reign in the US Top 10 as if she is still pinching herself. “For a purely R\u0026ampB song with no featured artists,” she says, “that’s insane.”With its puppy-love lyrics, Boo’d Up is a rose-tinted trip back to a time when a Friday night canoodling at the local arcade was dating goals, and the only right-swiping was at a Tesco checkout. Over a beat that sounds like a lost classic from SWV or Xscape, Mai’s swooning vocals transpose teenage heart-flutters into the chorus’s giddily onomatopoeic hook, on which she scats: “Ba-dum, boo’d up Biddy-da-dum, boo’d up.” Among the sharp-edged trap and hip-hop that dominates today’s playlists, Mai’s laid-back style is a welcome rush of nostalgia, like the first sip of Ribena on a summer’s day.She says it makes her “super proud” to represent the UK, but her US dominance is yet to be replicated in her birthplace. That is partly because Mai lives in LA, where she is signed to hip-hop heavyweight DJ Mustard’s 10 Summers label. But also, “the music industry in England doesn’t really know what to do with R\u0026ampB,” Mai says. “If it were up to England, Boo’d Up definitely wouldn’t be where it is now.”Despite Britain’s rich history of soul artists, pure R\u0026ampB can often feel sidelined. A new wave of artists such as Mabel and Jorja Smith have scored their biggest hits by leaning into Afro bashment and UK garage, while the slightly more retro grooves of Etta Bond, Mahalia, and NAO don’t get the mainstream love they deserve.Growing up in Wimbledon Chase and Mitcham in south-west London, Mai’s mum gave her a love of music, and would play Mary J Blige, Lauryn Hill, and old jazz records around the house. When she got a teaching job in New York City, her daughter, then 12, joined her and moved to the city’s Queens neighbourhood, before returning to the UK at 17 and studying at London’s BIMM music college. At 19, she auditioned for The X Factor with a couple of mates, performing a well-crafted, if unmemorable, cover of a Little Mix ballad. She first truly found her audience on Instagram, belting out soulful takes of Drake and Kanye West hits. “That was a huge part of building my fanbase,” Mai says. “I had no makeup on my hair looked crazy. I was just being myself: the girl next door.”Mai strengthened those connections to fans with sincere songs about self-acceptance, and biting kiss-offs (“I hope the next girl you love ends up fucking you over,” she sneered on one early track). On Boo’d Up’s parent EP, Ready, tracks are linked by straight-talking interludes aimed at a partner, like Destiny Child’s The Writing’s On the Wall for the WhatsApp generation. But for older audiences, Mai’s retro-leaning style can summon decades-old musical memories. “I can press play on Boo’d Up and reminisce,” says Marsha Ambrosius, a solo R\u0026ampB artist formerly of millennium-era duo Floetry. “I can put my hair in a pineapple up-do, gel down fingerwaves at the side, and feel like it’s 1996. Among all the current madness, you just wanna listen to something that makes you feel good again.”That feeling may be too irresistible for the UK to pass up. On this week’s midweek singles chart, Boo’d Up jumped from 78 to 56, and it was added to Radio 1’s C-list last week, meaning it will be played around eight times a week. “People request it all he time,” says DJ Ace, who runs an R\u0026ampB show on BBC 1Xtra. “I was recently in Ibiza, and that was the number one record that women wanted to hear in the club.”As her next single Trip is released this week, Mai wants Boo’d Up to be a success in the UK: for herself, sure, but also to prove R\u0026ampB’s deserved place at the heart of UK music. “There’s a place for R\u0026ampB in the UK industry, a huge market,” she says. “I hope that Boo’d Up can be a testament to the fact. Sometimes, it takes you moving outside the box to prove that it can be done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a0b054cd0690b4f9a8df411241ac5daa0d610f/0_77_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86457e09c8340a13ef8c2510f8d44d94","title":"pop dance star jonas blue the expectations around me are insane","story":"The musician’s track Rise has caught the mood of Britain’s heatwave summer, sending his streaming numbers into the billions. But, he says from his Ibiza residency, it can all easily go wrongAny rock’n’roll biopic worth its salt will feature a scene where the musician is portrayed as a child, gazing at a guitar in a shop window, or at some icon on stage, in a moment of wonderment and revelation. For Jonas Blue, fast becoming one of the UK’s biggest pop stars, this moment came aged 10 in an Essex bedroom. “My cousin used to go round to this guy’s house and MC to garage tunes,” he says. “One weekend, we had to go and pick him up – I walked into his bedroom and I remember seeing a Pioneer CDJ-100S and a DJM-300 mixer, all in silver. I saw all the flashing lights and thought: ‘I don’t know what this is, but I know I want to do this for the rest of my life.’”Eighteen years of music-making later, he is now tantalisingly close to his first No 1, with Rise, a vitamin D-rich track that has been shooting up the charts in line with heatwave thermometers. It follows others such as Mama (nominated for a Brit award), Perfect Strangers and his pop-dance cover of Tracy Chapman’s Fast Car, all of which just skirted the top spot, but have collectively earned billions of streams for their pretty marimba melodies and carefree lyrics.He has also been signed up by the Ibiza superclub Hï as a resident DJ every Sunday night. I meet him for dinner after a set at Ushuaïa next door, a glam alfresco club whose endless showboating spumes of CO2 are surely contributing to Europe’s shortage. Tonight, he sports his own line of merch a boxer’s nose roughens his Love Island handsomeness, and it is all topped off with hair that looks like a flame emoji in chestnut. Fantastical sushi arrives in waves.Also here is his girlfriend, the striking German model Melinda London. Jonas says that, when he split with his previous girlfriend of six years, “I wasn’t going to get back into a relationship because I just wanted the focus to be on my work. I was willing to sacrifice that – all my friends, partying, seeing my family. I never thought I’d be able to love again in that kind of way. So when I met Melinda …” – their eyes mist heavily – “… I found that, with the music I make, I love giving love and receiving love. And I realised that I was missing that in my life.”If it sounds like a charmed life, Jonas knows how precarious it is. “The expectations of everyone around me are insane,” he says. “The numbers that are expected of me and my music … to even talk of music in that way is pretty mad.”Is pop a cut-throat business? “Yeah. It’s the worst. If you’re not at the top of your game and you’re falling down, people are ready to kick you out.” He has had wobbles – the single before Rise only went to No 74. “It’s the worst feeling, going into your record label when you haven’t got a hit. It was like: ‘Maybe you’ve lost it.’ And, once you’re done, that’s it. There’s no support, or anyone to help you.”He credits a “very strong family” as his support network – he recorded his first hits in his parents’ house in Barkingside, east London, and got his dad to lend him money to buy a DJ setup, paying him back with what he earned playing friends’ parties and barmitzvahs. He had another revelatory moment watching Club Reps, an early 00s Channel 4 reality show about “the bad side of Ibiza, really – a load of Brits getting wrecked. But you would see Erick Morillo, David Guetta and Carl Cox DJing. I’m a little bit of a show-off I just wanted to get girls and be popular. So seeing people in a club facing towards the DJ … I was like: ‘Oh, my God.’“But when I got my decks, the musician in me was, like: ‘Why am I playing other people’s music?’ I wanted to create.” At 13, he discovered the Swedish pop producer Max Martin, someone he talks about with the fervour of a cult devotee. “When you listen to Britney’s Baby One More Time” – he sings Martin’s opening three-note fanfare – “you’re in. He had a seven-second rule: straight away, you had to be hooked. That has stuck with me to this day.”The teenage Jonas would work on production and songwriting until 4am and get up for school at eight. “I was a zombie. I started going in later and later. It got to the point where I just wouldn’t go and the school would call my house. One morning, my mum came into my bedroom and she was crying – she said she was getting ill because of it and it wasn’t fair on her. But I had been speaking to all these record labels, I knew I was getting somewhere. So I burned a CD of all the music I had been working on and took it to my headteacher at lunchtime. I said: ‘This is what I’m doing. There’s a record label in Florida that loves what I’m doing. And I’m going to do it.’ She said: ‘What does that mean?’ I said: ‘I’m never coming into school again.’ I was 15.”He doesn’t have any GCSEs. “But I wholeheartedly believe I made the right decision. It stems from my dad, who had his own videography business, and my grandpa, who was a photographer, one of the first people to bring colour photos into our area. It passed to me, that entrepreneurial spirit. I saw school as a business and, once I had got what I needed out of it, I left. I have never had a normal job since.”He first started making music under his real name, Guy Robin, and was signed to the house label Defected, before a name change to Scales, a genre switch to garage, and a jump to Chase and Status’s label MTA. “Until 2015, I was chasing and copying people – I didn’t have a sound.” The hinge was his version of Fast Car, “my mum’s favourite song when I was a baby”. It was made in one evening as a erting side project and was played to a rapturous Ted Cockle, the CEO of Virgin Records, during a meeting about its guest vocalist, Dakota. It kicked off Robin’s career as Jonas Blue. (Ever the Martin devotee, he chose the pseudonym for its Scandinavian feel.)He now collaborates with a couple of other songwriters, Sam Roman and Ed Drewett, having failed to gel with others earlier in his career. “I don’t get along with many people, especially in studios,” he says. “I’m quite blunt and I know what I want – and songwriters are very sensitive people. If you tell them their work is terrible, which I have done in the past, it goes very badly and people get hurt.”Jonas is in the awkward position, like another of his idols Calvin Harris, of being a non-singing star who relies on guest vocalists, but – ever the sunshiney optimist – he sees it as having his cake and eating it: “I can be in the studio, that guy between the speakers, but I can also go out on stage and be a frontman.”Pop’s sword of Damocles still hangs over him – even more so now that Rise is doing so well. “My dad was like: ‘This is amazing … you’ve got another hit!’ But Rise is finished, it’s out. So what’s the next one going to be? And that is tiring.” Tomorrow morning, after tonight’s euphoric house set, Jonas and Melinda will fly to another gig in France, and then one in Belgium. “I feel like I’m in a dreamworld – it has been amazing,” he says. “I need to find another word for amazing.” His GCSE English teacher is probably despairing, but we would probably all swap some vocab for positivity like his."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0444d480f970fc6f5bd698470a0665e4b7c7707/930_0_3850_2310/master/3850.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=907b37f568b4f1237fa0f31ba81cc4e8","title":"denialism what drives people to reject the truth","story":"From vaccines to climate change to genocide, a new age of denialism is upon us. Why have we failed to understand it? By  Keith Kahn-HarrisWe are all in denial, some of the time at least. Part of being human, and living in a society with other humans, is finding clever ways to express – and conceal – our feelings. From the most sophisticated diplomatic language to the baldest lie, humans find ways to deceive. Deceptions are not necessarily malign at some level they are vital if humans are to live together with civility. As Richard Sennett has argued: “In practising social civility, you keep silent about things you know clearly but which you should not and do not say.”Just as we can suppress some aspects of ourselves in our self-presentation to others, so we can do the same to ourselves in acknowledging or not acknowledging what we desire. Most of the time, we spare ourselves from the torture of recognising our baser yearnings. But when does this necessary private self-deception become harmful? When it becomes public dogma. In other words: when it becomes denialism.Denialism is an expansion, an intensification, of denial. At root, denial and denialism are simply a subset of the many ways humans have developed to use language to deceive others and themselves. Denial can be as simple as refusing to accept that someone else is speaking truthfully. Denial can be as unfathomable as the multiple ways we avoid acknowledging our weaknesses and secret desires.Denialism is more than just another manifestation of the humdrum intricacies of our deceptions and self-deceptions. It represents the transformation of the everyday practice of denial into a whole new way of seeing the world and – most important – a collective accomplishment. Denial is furtive and routine denialism is combative and extraordinary. Denial hides from the truth, denialism builds a new and better truth.In recent years, the term has been used to describe a number of fields of “scholarship”, whose scholars engage in audacious projects to hold back, against seemingly insurmountable odds, the findings of an avalanche of research. They argue that the Holocaust (and other genocides) never happened, that anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change is a myth, that Aids either does not exist or is unrelated to HIV, that evolution is a scientific impossibility, and that all manner of other scientific and historical orthodoxies must be rejected.In some ways, denialism is a terrible term. No one calls themselves a “denialist”, and no one signs up to all forms of denialism. In fact, denialism is founded on the assertion that it is not denialism. In the wake of Freud (or at least the vulgarisation of Freud), no one wants to be accused of being “in denial”, and labelling people denialists seems to compound the insult by implying that they have taken the private sickness of denial and turned it into public dogma.But denial and denialism are closely linked what humans do on a large scale is rooted in what we do on a small scale. While everyday denial can be harmful, it is also just a mundane way for humans to respond to the incredibly difficult challenge of living in a social world in which people lie, make mistakes and have desires that cannot be openly acknowledged. Denialism is rooted in human tendencies that are neither freakish nor pathological.All that said, there is no doubt that denialism is dangerous. In some cases, we can point to concrete examples of denialism causing actual harm. In South Africa, President Thabo Mbeki, in office between 1999 and 2008, was influenced by Aids denialists such as Peter Duesberg, who deny the link between HIV and Aids (or even HIV’s existence) and cast doubt on the effectiveness of anti-retroviral drugs. Mbeki’s reluctance to implement national treatment programmes using anti-retrovirals has been estimated to have cost the lives of 330,000 people. On a smaller scale, in early 2017 the Somali-American community in Minnesota was struck by a childhood measles outbreak, as a direct result of proponents of the discredited theory that the MMR vaccine causes autism, persuading parents not to vaccinate their children.More commonly though, denialism’s effects are less direct but more insidious. Climate change denialists have not managed to overturn the general scientific consensus that it is occurring and caused by human activity. What they have managed to do is provide subtle and not-so-subtle support for those opposed to taking radical action to address this urgent problem. Achieving a global agreement that could underpin a transition to a post-carbon economy, and that would be capable of slowing the temperature increase, was always going to be an enormous challenge. Climate change denialism has helped to make the challenge even harder.Denialism can also create an environment of hate and suspicion. Forms of genocide denialism are not just attempts to overthrow irrefutable historical facts they are an assault on those who survive genocide, and their descendants. The implacable denialism that has led the Turkish state to refuse to admit that the 1917 Armenian genocide occurred is also an attack on today’s Armenians, and on any other minority that would dare to raise troubling questions about the status of minorities in Turkey. Similarly, those who deny the Holocaust are not trying to disinterestedly “correct” the historical record they are, with varying degrees of subtlety, trying to show that Jews are pathological liars and fundamentally dangerous, as well as to rehabilitate the reputation of the Nazis.The dangers that other forms of denialism pose may be less concrete, but they are no less serious. Denial of evolution, for example, does not have an immediately hateful payoff rather it works to foster a distrust in science and research that feeds into other denialisms and undermines evidence-based policymaking. Even lunatic-fringe denialisms, such as flat Earth theories, while hard to take seriously, help to create an environment in which real scholarship and political attempts to engage with reality, break down in favour of an all-encompassing suspicion that nothing is what it seems.Denialism has moved from the fringes to the centre of public discourse, helped in part by new technology. As information becomes freer to access online, as “research” has been opened to anyone with a web browser, as previously marginal voices climb on to the online soapbox, so the opportunities for countering accepted truths multiply. No one can be entirely ostracised, marginalised and dismissed as a crank anymore.The sheer profusion of voices, the plurality of opinions, the cacophony of the controversy, are enough to make anyone doubt what they should believe.So how do you fight denialism? Denialism offers a dystopian vision of a world unmoored, in which nothing can be taken for granted and no one can be trusted. If you believe that you are being constantly lied to, paradoxically you may be in danger of accepting the untruths of others. Denialism is a mix of corrosive doubt and corrosive credulity.It’s perfectly understandable that denialism sparks anger and outrage, particularly in those who are directly challenged by it. If you are a Holocaust survivor, a historian, a climate scientist, a resident of a flood-plain, a geologist, an Aids researcher or someone whose child caught a preventable disease from an unvaccinated child, denialism can feel like an assault on your life’s work, your core beliefs or even your life itself. Such people do fight back. This can include, in some countries, supporting laws against denialism, as in France’s prohibition of Holocaust denial. Attempts to teach “creation science” alongside evolution in US schools are fought with tenacity. Denialists are routinely excluded from scholarly journals and academic conferences.The most common response to denialism, though, is debunking. Just as denialists produce a large and ever-growing body of books, articles, websites, lectures and videos, so their detractors respond with a literature of their own. Denialist claims are refuted point by point, in a spiralling contest in which no argument – however ludicrous – is ever left unchallenged. Some debunkings are endlessly patient and civil, treating denialists and their claims seriously and even respectfully others are angry and contemptuous.Yet none of these strategies work, at least not completely. Take the libel case that the Holocaust denier David Irving brought against Deborah Lipstadt in 1996. Irving’s claim that accusing him of being a Holocaust denier and a falsifier of history was libellous were forensically demolished by Richard Evans and other eminent historians. The judgment was devastating to Irving’s reputation and unambiguous in its rejection of his claim to be a legitimate historian. The judgment bankrupted him, he was repudiated by the few remaining mainstream historians who had supported him, and in 2006 he was imprisoned in Austria for Holocaust denial.But Irving today? He is still writing and lecturing, albeit in a more covert fashion. He still makes similar claims and his defenders see him as a heroic figure who survived the attempts of the Jewish-led establishment to silence him. Nothing really changed. Holocaust denial is still around, and its proponents find new followers. In legal and scholarly terms, Lipstadt won an absolute victory, but she didn’t beat Holocaust denial or even Irving in the long term.There is a salutary lesson here: in democratic societies at least, denialism cannot be beaten legally, or through debunking, or through attempts to discredit its proponents. That’s because, for denialists, the existence of denialism is itself a triumph. Central to denialism is an argument that “the truth” has been suppressed by its enemies. To continue to exist is a heroic act, a victory for the forces of truth.Of course, denialists might yearn for a more complete victory – when theories of anthropogenic climate change will be marginalised in academia and politics, when the story of how the Jews hoaxed the world will be in every history book – but, for now, every day that denialism persists is a good day. In fact, denialism can achieve more modest triumphs even without total victory. For the denialist, every day barrels of oil continue to be extracted and burned is a good day, every day a parent doesn’t vaccinate their child is a good day, every day a teenager Googling the Holocaust finds out that some people think it never happened is a good day.Conversely, denialism’s opponents rarely have time on their side. As climate change rushes towards the point of no return, as Holocaust survivors die and can no longer give testimony, as once-vanquished diseases threaten pandemics, as the notion that there is “doubt” on settled scholarship becomes unremarkable, so the task facing the debunkers becomes both more urgent and more difficult. It’s understandable that panic can set in and that anger overwhelms some of those who battle against denialism.A better approach to denialism is one of self-criticism. The starting point is a frank question: why did we fail? Why have those of us who abhor denialism not succeeded in halting its onward march? And why have we as a species managed to turn our everyday capacity to deny into an organised attempt to undermine our collective ability to understand the world and change it for the better?These questions are beginning to be asked in some circles. They are often the result of a kind of despair. Campaigners against anthropogenic global warming often lament that, as the task becomes ever more urgent, so denialism continues to run rampant (along with apathy and “softer” forms of denial). It appears that nothing works in the campaign to make humanity aware of the threat it faces.The obstinacy with which people can stick to disproved notions is attested to in the social sciences and in neuroscientific research. Humans are not only reasoning beings who disinterestedly weigh evidence and arguments. But there is a difference between the pre-conscious search for confirmation of existing views – we all engage in that to some extent – and the deliberate attempt to dress this search up as a quest for truth, as denialists do. Denialism adds extra layers of reinforcement and defence around widely shared psychological practices with the (never articulated) aim of preventing their exposure. This certainly makes changing the minds of denialists even more difficult than changing the minds of the rest of stubborn humanity.There are multiple kinds of denialists: from those who are sceptical of all established knowledge, to those who challenge one type of knowledge from those who actively contribute to the creation of denialist scholarship, to those who quietly consume it from those who burn with certainty, to those who are privately sceptical about their scepticism. What they all have in common, I would argue, is a particular type of desire. This desire – for something not to be true – is the driver of denialism.Empathy with denialists is not easy, but it is essential. Denialism is not stupidity, or ignorance, or mendacity, or psychological pathology. Nor is it the same as lying. Of course, denialists can be stupid, ignorant liars, but so can any of us. But denialists are people in a desperate predicament.It is a very modern predicament. Denialism is a post‑enlightenment phenomenon, a reaction to the “inconvenience” of many of the findings of modern scholarship. The discovery of evolution, for example, is inconvenient to those committed to a literalist biblical account of creation. Denialism is also a reaction to the inconvenience of the moral consensus that emerged in the post-enlightenment world. In the ancient world, you could erect a monument proudly proclaiming the genocide you committed to the world. In the modern world, mass killing, mass starvation, mass environmental catastrophe can no longer be publicly legitimated.Yet many humans still want to do the same things humans always did. We are still desiring beings. We want to murder, to steal, to destroy and to despoil. We want to preserve our ignorance and unquestioned faith. So when our desires are rendered unspeakable in the modern world, we are forced to pretend that we do not yearn for things we desire.Denial is not enough here. As an attempt to draw awareness and attention away from something unpalatable, it is always vulnerable to challenge. Denial is a kind of high-wire act that can be unbalanced by forceful attempts to draw attention to what is being denied.Denialism is, in part, a response to the vulnerability of denial. To be in denial is to know at some level. To be a denialist is to never have to know at all. Denialism is a systematic attempt to prevent challenge and acknowledgment to suggest that there is nothing to acknowledge. Whereas denial is at least subject to the possibility of confrontation with reality, denialism can rarely be undermined by appeals to face the truth.The tragedy for denialists is that they concede the argument in advance. Holocaust deniers’ attempts to deny that the Holocaust took place imply that it would not have been a good thing if it had. Climate change denialism is predicated on a similarly hidden acknowledgment that, if anthropogenic climate change were actually occurring, we would have to do something about it.Denialism is therefore not just hard work – finding ways to discredit mountains of evidence is a tremendous labour – but also involves suppressing the expression of one’s desires. Denialists are “trapped” into byzantine modes of argument because they have few other options in pursuing their goals.Denialism, and related phenomena, are often portrayed as a “war on science”. This is an understandable but profound misunderstanding. Certainly, denialism and other forms of pseudo-scholarship do not follow mainstream scientific methodologies. Denialism does indeed represent a perversion of the scholarly method, and the science it produces rests on profoundly erroneous assumptions, but denialism does all this in the name of science and scholarship. Denialism aims to replace one kind of science with another – it does not aim to replace science itself. In fact, denialism constitutes a tribute to the prestige of science and scholarship in the modern world. Denialists are desperate for the public validation that science affords.While denialism has sometimes been seen as part of a post-modern assault on truth, the denialist is just as invested in notions of scientific objectivity as the most unreconstructed positivist. Even those who are genuinely committed to alternatives to western rationality and science can wield denialist rhetoric that apes precisely the kind of scientism they despise. Anti-vaxxers, for example, sometimes seem to want to have their cake and eat it: to have their critique of western medicine validated by western medicine.The rhetoric of denialism and its critics can resemble each other in a kind of war to the death over who gets to wear the mantle of science. The term “junk science” has been applied to climate change denialism, as well as in defence of it. Mainstream science can also be dogmatic and blind to its own limitations. If the accusation that global warming is an example of politicised ideology masked as science is met with indignant assertions of the absolute objectivity of “real” science, there is a risk of blinding oneself to uncomfortable questions regarding the subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which the idea of pure truth, untrammelled by human interests, is elusive. Human interests can rarely if ever be separated from the ways we observe the world. Indeed, sociologists of science have shown how modern ideas of disinterested scientific knowledge have disguised the inextricable links between knowledge and human interests.I do not believe that, if only one could find the key to “make them understand”, denialists would think just like me. A global warming denialist is not an environmentalist who cannot accept that he or she is really an environmentalist a Holocaust denier is not someone who cannot face the inescapable obligation to commemorate the Holocaust an Aids denialist is not an Aids activist who won’t acknowledge the necessity for western medicine in combating the disease and so on. If denialists were to stop denying, we cannot assume that we would then have a shared moral foundation on which we could make progress as a species.Denialism is not a barrier to acknowledging a common moral foundation it is a barrier to acknowledging moral differences. An end to denialism is therefore a disturbing prospect, as it would involve these moral differences revealing themselves directly. But we need to start preparing for that eventuality, because denialism is starting to break down – and not in a good way.On 6 November 2012, when he was already preparing the ground for his presidential run, Donald Trump sent a tweet about climate change. It said: “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”At the time, this seemed to be just another example of the mainstreaming of climate change denialism on the American right. After all, the second Bush administration had done as little as possible to combat climate change, and many leading Republicans are prominent crusaders against mainstream climate science. Yet something else was happening here, too the tweet was a harbinger of a new kind of post-denialist discourse.Trump’s claim is not one that is regularly made by “mainstream” global warming denialists. It may have been a garbled version of the common argument on the US right that global climate treaties will unfairly weaken the US economy to the benefit of China. Like much of Trump’s discourse, the tweet was simply thrown into the world without much thought. This is not how denialism usually works. Denialists usually labour for decades to produce, often against overwhelming odds, carefully crafted simulacra of scholarship that, to non-experts at least, are indistinguishable from the real thing. They have refined alternative scholarly techniques that can cast doubt on even the most solid of truths.Trump and the post-truthers’ “lazy” denialism rests on the security that comes from knowing that generations of denialists have created enough doubt already all people like Trump need to do is to signal vaguely in a denialist direction. Whereas denialism explains – at great length – post-denialism asserts. Whereas denialism is painstakingly thought-through, post-denialism is instinctive. Whereas denialism is disciplined, post-denialism is anarchic.The internet has been an important factor in this weakening of denialist self-discipline. The intemperance of the online world is pushing denialism so far that it is beginning to fall apart. The new generation of denialists aren’t creating new, alternative orthodoxies so much as obliterating the very idea of orthodoxy itself. The collective, institutional work of building a substantial bulwark against scholarly consensus gives way to a kind of free-for-all.One example of this is the 911 truth movement. Because the attacks occurred in an already wired world, the denialism it spawned has never managed to institutionalise and develop an orthodoxy in the way that pre-internet denialisms did. Those who believe that the “official story” of the September 11 attacks was a lie can believe that elements in the US government had foreknowledge of the attacks but let them happen, or that the attacks were deliberately planned and carried out by the government, or that JewsIsraelMossad were behind it, or that shadowy forces in the “New World Order” were behind it – or some cocktail of all of these. They can believe that the towers were brought down by controlled demolition, or that no planes hit the towers, or that there were no floors in the towers, or that there were no passengers in the planes.Post-denialism represents a freeing of the repressed desires that drive denialism. While it still based on the denial of an established truth, its methods liberate a deeper kind of desire: to remake truth itself, to remake the world, to unleash the power to reorder reality itself and stamp one’s mark on the planet. What matters in post-denialism is not the establishment of an alternative scholarly credibility, so much as giving yourself blanket permission to see the world however you like.While post-denialism has not yet supplanted its predecessor, old-style denialism is beginning to be questioned by some of its practitioners as they take tentative steps towards a new age. This is particularly evident on the racist far right, where the dominance of Holocaust denial is beginning to erode.Mark Weber, director of the (denialist) Institute for Historical Review, glumly concluded in an article in 2009 that Holocaust denial had become irrelevant in a world that continues to memorialise the genocide. Some Holocaust deniers have even recanted, expressing their frustration with the movement and acknowledging that many of its claims are simply untenable, as Eric Hunt, previously a producer of widely circulated online videos denying the Holocaust, did in 2016. Yet such admissions of defeat are certainly not accompanied by a retreat from antisemitism. Weber treats the failures of Holocaust denial as a consequence of the nefarious power of the Jews: “Suppose The New York Times were to report tomorrow that Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust centre and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum had announced that no more than 1 million Jews died during the second world war, and that no Jews were killed in gas chambers at Auschwitz. The impact on Jewish-Zionist power would surely be minimal.”Indeed, the Daily Stormer, one of the most prominent online publications of the resurgent far-right, demonstrates an exuberant agility in balancing denialism, post-denialism and open hatred simultaneously, using humour as a method of floating between them all. But there is no doubt what the ultimate destination is. As Andrew Anglin, who runs the site, put it in a style guide for contributors that was later leaked to the press: “The unindoctrinated should not be able to tell if we are joking or not. There should also be a conscious awareness of mocking stereotypes of hateful racists. I usually think of this as self-deprecating humour – I am a racist making fun of stereotypes of racists, because I don’t take myself super-seriously. This is obviously a ploy and I actually do want to gas kikes. But that’s neither here nor there.”Not all denialists are taking these steps towards open acknowledgment of their desires. In some fields, the commitment to repressing desire remains strong. We are not yet at a stage when a climate change denier can come out and say, proudly, “Bangladesh will be submerged, millions will suffer as a result of anthropogenic climate change, but we must still preserve our carbon-based way of life, no matter what the cost.” Nor are anti-vaxxers ready to argue that, even though vaccines do not cause autism, the death of children from preventable diseases is a regrettable necessity if we are to be released from the clutches of Big Pharma.Still, over time it is likely that traditional denialists will be increasingly influenced by the emerging post-denialist milieu. After all, what oil industry-funded wonk labouring to put together a policy paper suggesting that polar bear populations aren’t declining hasn’t fantasised of resorting to gleeful, Trumpian assertions?The possibility of an epochal shift away from denialism means that there is now no avoiding a reckoning with some discomfiting issues: how do we respond to people who have radically different desires and morals from our own? How do we respond to people who delight in or are indifferent to genocide, to the suffering of millions, to venality and greed?Denialism, and the multitude of other ways that modern humans have obfuscated their desires, prevent a true reckoning with the unsettling fact that some of us might desire things that most of us regard as morally reprehensible. I say “might” because while denialism is an attempt to covertly legitimise an unspeakable desire, the nature of the denialist’s understanding of the consequences of enacting that desire is usually unknowable.It is hard to tell whether global warming denialists are secretly longing for the chaos and pain that global warming will bring, are simply indifferent to it, or would desperately like it not to be the case but are overwhelmed with the desire to keep things as they are. It is hard to tell whether Holocaust deniers are preparing the ground for another genocide, or want to keep a pristine image of the goodness of the Nazis and the evil of the Jews. It is hard to tell whether an Aids denialist who works to prevent Africans from having access to anti-retrovirals is getting a kick out of their power over life and death, or is on a mission to save them from the evils of the west.If the new realm of unrestrained online discourse, and the example set by Trump, tempts more and more denialists to transition towards post-denialism and beyond, we will finally know where we stand. Instead of chasing shadows, we will be able to contemplate the stark moral choices we humans face.Maybe we have been putting this test off for too long. The liberation of desire we are beginning to witness is forcing us all to confront some very difficult questions: who are we as a species? Do we all (the odd sociopath aside) share a common moral foundation? How do we relate to people whose desires are starkly different from our own?Perhaps, if we can face up to the challenge presented by these new revelations, it might pave the way for a politics shorn of illusion and moral masquerade, where different visions of what it is to be human can openly contend. This might be a firmer foundation on which to rekindle some hope for human progress – based not on illusions of what we would like to be, but on an accounting of what we are.Adapted from Denial: The Unspeakable Truth by Keith Kahn-Harris, which will be published by Notting Hill Editions on 13 September, and is available to pre-order at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a758fa36c381df126a238a105c0beee4698c382/0_171_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d225e0d595d946d2c714caf544551ac7","title":"soaring rents rose 60 faster than pay since 2011 shelter","story":"The charity said the rental crisis was spreading out from London to cities like Cambridge, Bristol and Birmingham, and to “middle England” towns such as Tunbridge Wells and Milton Keynes, where people are increasingly unable to afford soaring rents while their wages lag behind.Greg Beales, the campaign director at Shelter, said: “With this surge in private renters the housing market has shifted massively and yet as a country we’ve failed to respond. This has resulted in consecutive governments focusing on better-off home owners while not doing enough for hardpressed renters. We need politicians of all parties to sit up and take notice of the rising numbers of renters, and ensure they’re doing all they can to protect them.”Recent figures from Nationwide revealed that a third of people privately renting in the UK have just £23 left to spend each week, once rent and utility and food bills have been paid. For most, renting is not a lifestyle choice: more than half of renters told Nationwide that they are only renting because they cannot afford to buy or can’t get a council house.Shelter is calling on the government to come up with a new plan for social housing so people on low pay can find somewhere affordable to rent.

That the course opens with a par three provides such opportunity. Hall’s first tee shot, to within a foot of the hole, was duly backed up. Her Thursday round of 67 – five under par and bogey-free – raises the prospect of only a third British success in this event since it was afforded major status in 2001.Hall will hope location carries deeper meaning: the last such victory, by Catriona Matthew in 2009, was at Lytham.Hall finished third in this event a year ago. Then, as now, the Englishwoman opted not to use her standard caddie, her boyfriend, Harry, with her father, Wayne, taking on bag‑carrying duties.“He knew about it in about March,” Hall said of the disappointment for Harry. “Dad’s done it for the last four or five years and he did the Scottish Open as well it is our thing. Harry was OK, he gets to do all the rest of the tournaments.”More pertinent, perhaps, was the dinner Hall shared with the former European Tour player turned analyst Ken Brown at the start of the week. “We were talking about when he played here and he walked nine holes with me on Wednesday,” Hall said.The 22-year-old Hall also welcomed the concept of pressure over the coming three days. “Because that means I’m doing OK,” she said. “It is the British Open. I expect some pressure.”Australia’s Minjee Lee, who lost out on a playoff at the Scottish Open on Sunday after missing a three-foot putt at the 72nd, set the early pace with a 65. Mamiko Higa of Japan is only one adrift.Matthew, playing in the company of Lee, signed for a 71. Charley Hull played the closing four holes in two under in matching Matthew’s score. Florentyna Parker’s 69 was most notable for a hole in one at the 9th. “I was two over par so you think: ‘Just hit the green’ because you’re not playing great,” Parker said. “It was a quite short hole, downwind. My caddie said eight iron. I wasn’t sure, seven or eight, since the wind was strong.“I hit my eight iron and I was like: ‘Phew, I got it on the green.’ It was directing towards the pin and bounced, I think, a few times, and then it just disappeared. It was amazing. I’ve now had three but that’s my first in a major.”A rapid improvement in the weather after a squally morning on the Lancashire coast was reflected in the scoring. Yu Liu was one of few to make progress as the wind swirled and rain battered down before taking a triple-bogey seven at the last for a 69. On the same hole, Shanshan Feng thinned a shot from a greenside bunker but watched her ball, remarkably, hit the pin before flying back to a decent position. Feng duly chipped in for a par four before providing the uncontrollable laugh which perfectly described the absurdity of the situation.Michelle Wie’s appearance lasted only 12 holes. From the position of seven over par she withdrew citing a hand problem.“I have been doing everything humanly possible this past couple of weeks to get my hand healthy enough to play this event,” she said. “Unfortunately it wasn’t enough. I gave it my all today but I just couldn’t handle the pain any longer.”A penny for the thoughts of Paula Creamer, the first reserve who would have been given a place in the field had Wie not started her round."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3225f7223cf17dcd5b9d1c4c75e0ccc95c5ef8a1/0_161_4280_2568/master/4280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf8aae4dbf0e8f67919ce2b990e64b8","title":"netherlands england womens hockey world cup match report","story":"England can console themselves with one thing: it will take an extraordinary performance for anyone to deny the Netherlands an eighth World Cup win between now and Sunday night. There is no shame in losing this comprehensively to such a fine side and, make no mistake, goals in each half from Lidewij Welten and Laurien Leurink could easily have been only a fraction of the story. But a tinge of regret may follow England’s exit from a home tournament that had promised so much and been supported so eagerly England rarely hit anything like their best form over the past 12 days and that is what cost them the chance to extend their interest into Saturday’s semi-finals.“We didn’t mess up today, we messed up in the group stage,” said Maddie Hinch, England’s outstanding goalkeeper. Hinch kept the scoreline respectable but her meaning was clear: had England kept their side of the bargain in a kind-looking Pool B, rather than finishing second, then the world’s top-ranked sides would have had no chance of meeting until the final. Instead the Netherlands were granted an early opportunity to avenge penalty shoot-out defeats in the 2015 EuroHockey and 2016 Olympic finals, the latter to Great Britain, and nothing other than cold retribution looked likely here.The occasion had been infused with a dose of trash talk by the Dutch captain, Carlien Dirkse van den Heuvel, a club-mate of Hinch with Dutch side SCHC, beforehand. She had said England play “chicken without the head” hockey, also suggesting her team could win 5-0. “If we were headless chickens they would have won 12-0,” Danny Kerry, the England coach said, and on the evidence of the first half it was hard to disagree. The Netherlands, who had scored 26 goals in their group games, flew at England and it took a brave block from Hinch to deny Kelly Jonker in the eighth minute. Caia van Massakker then cracked a ferocious shot against the bar from a penalty corner, Hinch saving the follow-up from Lauren Stam, and England had done little but cower around their own area.The only question was when they would crack and they duly conceded in the 14th minute when Xan de Waard played a smart reverse pass for Welten to finish first time. For England it was already a case of trying to hang in there.They achieved that in the second quarter despite several more alarms. Suzy Petty scrambled one loose ball away and Hinch denied Jonker again. At half-time Kerry’s side left the field feeling buoyed to have avoided further punishment.Any encouragement was extinguished within a minute of the restart. England simply could not afford to make mistakes and, when Giselle Ansley gave the ball away midway inside her own half, the writing was on the wall. A rapier-like attack ended with Leurink converting a straightforward finish after unselfish play from Frédérique Matla.It was an honest assessment. The Netherlands were several yards quicker throughout and thoroughly relentless. To use a football analogy, they recover the ball with the ferocity of Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City England were smothered and managed only one flicker of excitement towards the end when Alex Danson stretched for, and missed, a low ball across the area.By then the game was long since up. England never quite had the belief to seek out their opponents’ weak points and must now return to the drawing board. “Everyone’s been chasing the Dutch since 2005,” said Kerry, who confirmed he intends to stay on for the next World Cup and, first of all, another Olympic campaign with Great Britain. “We don’t kid ourselves, we know there’s a gap.”Hinch admitted it was galling to see the surprise package Ireland, whom England had defeated in the group stage after a dominant performance, play Spain in the last four after defeating India 3-1 on penalties.That match had finished goalless after 60 minutes virtually bereft of major incident it hammered home the opportunity England missed but, as their goalkeeper admitted, they had only themselves to blame.The Netherlands will face Australia for a place in the final and the sense is that only complacency can deny them now. Dirkse van den Heuvel’s bombast may not have been to everyone’s taste here, though, they more than backed it up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bfd1704f2ed8cc4ca2ada2006b38f8ae1dd7d33/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8e759cf7682e88a84e5a180ee3f566e","title":"india ticket prices first test england edgbaston","story":"• Asian cricket official says ‘element of cashing in’ at Edgbaston• Second-day attendance was 16,754 in 25,000-capacity groundCommunities of Indian cricket fans may have stayed away from the Edgbaston Test because organisers were trying to “cash in” on their enormous interest in the game by raising ticket prices, according to Gulfraz Riaz, chairman at the National Asian Cricket Council.The first day of England men’s 1,000th Test began in front of large swaths of empty seats on Wednesday and the South Asian community in particular appeared to have shunned the longer format of the game, although the England and Wales Cricket Board provided figures which suggested overall numbers of tickets bought were comparable to 2014.Edgbaston’s capacity of 25,000 was reduced by 1,500 seats for the fixture because of sightscreen requirements. But on Wednesday the attendance was just 18,159 and on Thursday 16,754. Tickets for the later session on Wednesday were reduced to £20 in a bid to lure spectators but Riaz believes the scarcity of fans could be due to a failure in pricing strategy, among other elements including a Wednesday start.“The benchmark will be what the attendance is like at Lord’s, Oval and Trent Bridge. But the pricing is a lot higher than previous Pakistan Test matches so there’s an element of cashing in, perhaps, on Asian communities’ passion for cricket.“From what I understand the prices are almost double what they were for Pakistan Test matches in some cases. Out of the two communities, the Indian cricket community is a bit more affluent and maybe they were targeted.”Starting the Test on a Wednesday instead of the traditional Thursday for the first Test may also have played a role in poor attendances, according to Riaz. “I think it would have been better to do it Thursday, Friday and Saturday, definitely to build some momentum. I think the marketing could have perhaps been better and there’s also the genuine question of whether Test cricket is relevant to the South Asian cricket community.A spokesman for Edgbaston said: “I don’t think our tickets were unreasonably priced starting at £29 for adults and £16 for children, the most affordable of all the Test match grounds. We have even had to open an extra stand on Friday because we are sold out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe19017c001ef3875d73d7bb3fe8a3aea602e5c/0_295_5675_3405/master/5675.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51dd1bc383ce83b902306f14d469d4fa","title":"lies review almeida theatre","story":"Almeida, LondonThis ingenious high-stakes show uncovers the psychology of those whose financial flutters shook the worldIn place of the Almeida theatre’s rows of tip-back seats are 10 semicircular gaming tables, each with a curve of seven stools. Though it is common to reorganise an auditorium to suit a show, £￥€$ (Lies), by the Belgian group Ontoerend Goed, removes any sense of a standard playhouse or, indeed, play.Thirteen black-clad performers serve as croupiers or financial advisers, but the busiest participants are the 70 ticketholders. Groups at each table form a bank and trade on global markets by gambling with poker chips.The experience most resembles an extreme game of Monopoly. Different rounds are ingeniously designed to offer more return for greater risk, and, on the bong of a gong, complications are presented, such as shorting, mergers and foreign bonds.One possible false note is that all institutions are expected to pay full tax to the central bank. One member of our team, showing what might be called an Amazonian attitude to her balance sheet, was punished by having to play for a while with special “naughty dice”. Potential objections to the project are that our interventions in the global economy are a matter of gambler’s luck rather than skill and that, as we are not playing with real money or consequences, the jeopardy is theoretical. However, a common critique of the financial industry is that it depends more on casino throws than economic theory, and many of those involved in the 2008 bank crashes admitted losing sight of the fact that they were playing with real lives and livelihoods. So the underlying unreality is the point.

Apple is one of them, with a string of products over its 42-year history that have revolutionised computing, upended industries and ultimately reshaped society.The company’s first computer, the Apple I, sold a few hundred units, barely enough to make an impression on a small high school. But its 1977 follow-up, the Apple II, was a different story. The innovations of the Apple II were so influential that it is hard to even see them as such today. The computer was housed in a sleek plastic case, modelled more on kitchen appliances than its predecessors in the microcomputing world.A built-in keyboard made input a dream, while an RF jack allowed owners to plug it into a standard television for output, making the Apple II a “ready-to-run” machine. And the whole thing cost “just” $1,298 – a shade under £4,000 today.It was enough to make the machine the workhorse of Apple’s lineup for more than five years. Almost problematically so: Apple’s attempts to replace the Apple II, such as the Apple III, or the Lisa, an early (expensive) example of a computer with a graphic user interface, struggled to take off. In the end, it took until 1984, when the company launched the Macintosh, for it to stumble upon a worthy successor.New industries turned to the technology, with Apple gaining a reputation in desktop publishing and digital art that it has held through to the present day. In 1987, Quark Inc released its QuarkXpress page layout software exclusively for the Macintosh. In 1990, Adobe Systems released Photoshop, exclusively for the Macintosh. In 1985, a year after the Macintosh was released, the software company Aldus released PageMaker, a desktop publishing program, again exclusively for the Macintosh. PageMaker was bought by Adobe and ultimately replaced by Adobe’s InDesign in 1999. InDesign is the software used to lay out the  today – and it is still on a Mac.Even by the time of the Macintosh, Apple’s strengths were becoming clear. The company was not the trailblazer: the Apple II was not the first microcomputer, and the Macintosh was not the first with a GUI.Instead, it was the company that brought concepts to the mainstream. And that is what it did almost 20 years after the Macintosh, with the product that remade Apple and put it on the path to becoming the world’s first trillion-dollar company: the iPod.When the iPod was first announced in 2001 the reaction from much of the technology press was apathetic. “No wireless. Less space than a Nomad. Lame,” was the verdict of Rob “CmdrTaco” Malda, the founder of the influential tech site Slashdot.MP3 players already existed, such as Malda’s Nomad Jukebox, and they were technically better, with larger hard drives, replaceable batteries, and compatibility with both Windows and Mac (the iPod would take another year to come to Windows). What did Apple have to offer?With hindsight, the answer is obvious. The iPod looked cool: it had a sleek aluminium shell half the size of its competitors, and a physical scroll wheel that could zoom through the trademark “1,000 songs in your pocket”. The iPod revolutionised Apple’s fortunes, kicking off a five-fold increase in its share price over the following five years, and providing a gateway drug for winning round Windows users to its Mac ecosystem. But it also changed the company on a fundamental level, turning it from a computer manufacturer into a consumer electronics designer.In January 2007, the company completed this transformation, announcing that it was changing its name from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. That same day, it also announced something else: the iPhone.Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder and chief executive at the time, revealed the iPhone to the world as three products in one: “A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device.”And for a while, that was all it was. But it was enough: the device sold out across the US when it launched in June that year – even at its initial launch price of $499 with a two-year contract. But the real revolution came a year later – almost exactly 10 years ago today –when Apple launched the App Store. If the iPhone was three products in one before the App Store, then on 10 July 2008 it did not become four products in one, or five it became 500, one for each new app available on the store on release day. Suddenly, the iPhone was a games console and an image editor, and a musical instrument and a torch. Apple is not just changing an industry: it is changing the world, reshaping it into an “app economy” and planting itself in the middle of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba18963f27f887168b76a5fe486c0e89e27e89d7/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f44fbc6179b7259b76261ec7bb1d285e","title":"what happens after ice tears your family apart the storm descended","story":"After Ice raids Fresh Mark, a meatpacking plant in Salem, Ohio, and detains 146 workers, chaos and confusion follow for affected families On 19 June, Ice officers descended on Fresh Mark, a meatpacking plant in Salem, Ohio, and detained 146 workers. The scene was chaotic. “Nos cayó la tormenta,” one worker told me: the storm descended on us.One minute, people were slapping labels on packages of bacon. The next, there were uniformed men shouting, “Go!” Many workers thought the building was on fire. They fled outside to handcuffs and the swirling lights of police cars. Three men hid in a storeroom, crouched on stacks of wooden pallets. They waited it out and escaped. All the other Hiic workers were detained, even those with work permits.Workers who could prove authorization were let go, though some were held for days. Pregnant women and women with small children were also released, a mercy bestowed only because of timing: earlier in June, after a large raid on an Ohio gardening center, hundreds of children had been stranded at daycare centers and schools when their parents were detained. The situation had caused public outcry, which Ice was keen to avoid this time around.Many of the released women were given ankle bracelets and court dates others were told to watch for papers in the mail. Meanwhile, the women held in detention disappeared. While the detained men were channeled to Youngstown and Cleveland and Michigan and began to strategize with family members via phone, the women vanished more than a week after the raid, no one had any idea where they were.In response, the labeling line at Fresh Mark sped up. The remaining workers had to compensate for missing bodies. Sandra, a Guatemalan mother of three who’d been detained in the raid and released because she was eight months pregnant, explained to me: “Los Americanos se van.” The Americans leave. The work is too much for them, the line too fast, she said, with the only hint of pride I saw light up her face. There were too few workers left: seven out of 11 in Sandra’s unit had been detained. The four who remained were viejitas, Sandra explained: little old ladies.Fresh Mark produces meat products: the hot dogs sold at baseball stadiums across the midwest, the pepperoni on pizza, the bacon on Wendy’s Baconator. These iconic American products – bought at Walmart and grilled in a backyard on the Fourth of July, sizzled up for Sunday breakfast, chowed in the seventh inning of a Reds game – are carefully prepared by indigenous Guatemalans working long hours without papers.The landing page on the Fresh Mark website is a banner of a little white boy taking a piece of bacon from a paper-towel covered plate, held out by an older white hand. The banner reads: “Feeding families is a great responsibility.” In the lower right corner is a circular stamp declaring: “Made With Pride, USA, Since 1920.” The Made in USA stamp travels with the scroll, standing firm in the right corner.Scrolling down, the company announces over a supersized image of pepperoni pizza: “Like you, we take it very seriously. Some of the world’s most well-known grocery stores, food service companies and restaurants count on Fresh Mark.”Scrolling a little further, the message concludes on a photo of a blonde, white girl eating a sandwich: “So our customers and yours,” the banner reads, “can focus on what really matters.”The Friday after the raid, I traveled to Salem with my friend Mary Jayne, who runs a non-profit that offers interpreting and translation services, to volunteer as an interpreter for released detainees and family members of the detained.Approaching Salem from the south-east, we drove on a narrow seam between plots of corn and soybean. Passing through the small communities of Unity and Columbiana, the American flags came on quick and brash: 15, 20, 50 in rapid succession, until the excess was almost comical. Then, quick as they’d appeared, the flags were gone, and we were back in open land and sky.Soon, we arrived at the Centro San Pablo, a charitable organization run out of the packed, overheated basement of Salem’s Saint Paul’s Catholic church.Centro San Pablo is run by Sister Rene Weeks, a tall, thin white woman with close-cropped gray hair who manages to be everywhere and handling everything at once. She welcomed us before disappearing into the fray. Two lawyers sat at a folding table with laptops and papers. The wait to see them was hours long. Women breastfed infants in slings, and many wore outfits that were Walmart incantations of indigenous Guatemalan dress: ankle-length skirts with floral prints, black flats with fake rhinestones. Several girls had combs in their long black hair, which fell to their waists. The men wore baseball caps, sleeveless tank tops and chanclas, open-toed athletic sandals. Most people were considerably shorter than my own 5ft 3in.The room held that distinctly Latin American energy derived from a whole lot of people waiting interminably for an obscure bureaucratic procedure that may never come to pass. There was an open box of sticky Dunkin’ Donuts. Stale coffee. Packages and packages of diapers. We joined the chaos.For the next three hours, we asked people for their names and immigration histories: were you detained? Was a family member detained? Have you heard from him or her? Did you sign anything? Have you ever been arrested, deported, had any interaction with the law?I snuck in extra questions on the side. I spent years living in Mexico, and my husband is from a tiny village that, 30 years ago, was much like the ones these people had fled. He and I have traveled throughout the remote mountain pueblos of Oaxaca, reporting on immigration, and in these Guatemalan workers’ faces I remembered those mountains – the smoke coming off comales, the señoras hurrying small children wrapped in fleece blankets through vast, empty plazas.“Why did you come?” I asked one woman, whose name I carefully sounded out after she told me with shamed apology that she could not read or write. Her face was marked by the pale splotches that signify malnutrition. Like many of these migrants, her first language was K’iche’, and her Spanish was basic. She squinted to understand me and I leaned closer to understand her. There wasn’t enough food for her and her son in Guatemala, she said. “We were searching for herbs.” When I pressed further, she shook her head, closed her eyes. “No, no, I don’t want to talk about that time.”She had come to the US with her brother, who was now in detention somewhere in the Midwest. She hadn’t heard from him since Tuesday. What could she do? she asked. I had no idea. “Gracias,” she said, and sat back to wait her turn. One intake form after another: detained brother, uncle, husband, wife. Can I go back to work? the room wondered collectively in a dozen variations. Even those with work permits were hesitant one 18-year-old waited hours just to sit with a lawyer and ask him if it was OK to go back.“You have a work permit!” the lawyer told him. “Yes, yes!”Around 5 o’clock, Sister Rene announced that we were done for the day. She asked for a closing prayer from a woman named Flor, who was a full foot shorter than me, with dark hair pulled back in a low ponytail. Flor had been detained in the raid but released. She had five children, including a six-month-old and a one-and-a-half-year-old. She stood in the middle of the room and smiled at us. Then she bowed her head and closed her eyes, thanking the sister and the volunteers, speaking to God with the notes of humility, endurance and misericordia that form the chorus of the migrant experience. When she opened her eyes, she began to cry.“Pray for my children,” she begged us, sobbing. “¿Qué van a hacer mis niños?”The next morning, Mary Jayne and I returned to the Centro San Pablo with another volunteer interpreter from El Salvador named Ximena. At 9am, families were already waiting to apply for assistance. Their breadwinners snatched, these families were suspended over a financial cliff. My day would be spent cataloguing need. “How much food do you have in your fridge right now?” “How much for rent?” “When is it due?” “Tienes biles?”Most people who weren’t part of a large family lived with at least three or four others. Most did not know their landlord’s name, or the name of their electric, light or gas companies. Someone showed up on their doorstep once a month and they handed that person an envelope of cash. On time, no questions. I had brought a bag of toys, and the second I put them on the ground they were descended upon by a small girl and boy. I gauged the boy’s age as about two, the girl perhaps four: she was the same height as my daughter. Their mother sat near them on a chair, shushing a tiny baby in a sling. She looked unbelievably young.I beckoned her to come over: “Pase.” She spoke hardly any Spanish, only K’iche’. She smiled a lot. Her baby was barely three weeks old, and sick. Her little girl, whom I had thought was four, was seven. The boy was two. The husband had a job at a rancho, picking fruit or vegetables, but something had happened I couldn’t make out specifics. Neither of them had been working at Fresh Mark but had noticed a fervor of help at this moment and positioned themselves near it.She did not know her address or her phone number and I couldn’t fill out her form. I offered to help carry diapers and wipes to her house so that her husband could give me this information and the Centro could contact them later.We set out across the hot parking lot. The mother walked quickly and the children kept up. The family crossed the streets diagonally, as if they were not streets at all but fields. Each time, I clutched the older daughter’s hand. The houses had chain link fences cordoning off tiny yards, soggy toys toppled in patches of grass. At the house, her husband was surprised and cordial, with a mouth full of gold teeth. He, too, looked impossibly young, barely into his early twenties. He spoke Spanish and explained that he’d been working at a rancho – a farm or gardening center – picking tomatoes, but the work was sporadic, and lately he hadn’t had enough. He was too scared now to try Fresh Mark. He was looking for more work at ranchos, but two huge raids in the preceding weeks made this dicey. He gave me his address and phone number while I watched the seven-year-old carefully remove the two-year-old’s shoes.The kitchen was small and smelled of cooking oil next to it was a living room of the same size, bare except for scattered objects around its edges, with a linoleum floor. I couldn’t see any other rooms, or furniture. The husband thanked me and I waved goodbye, the mother smiling the same smile – innocent or weary, I couldn’t tell.Flor, who’d led the prayer on my first afternoon in Salem, told me: “We ran away from one thing in Guatemala, and now another thing is happening to us.” Everywhere these migrants went, they worked – the most difficult and least appreciated work – and everywhere they went they were loathed for it.When Flor was detained, and she waited for hours panicking about whether she’d ever see her children again, she thought, I am not a criminal. I’m fighting to eat, to give something to my children. I’m not stealing.When the national conversation tends to revolve only around the “illegality” of immigrants – the role of various agencies in immigration enforcement, what that enforcement should look like and how much it should cost, and most of all, whether or not to give “amnesty” – no one actually has to acknowledge their labor.Amnesty is the most ironic term of all: Republicans rage and Democrats cower at the idea of granting “forgiveness” to the people who have, for decades, been powering the US economy. Here the absurdity of their invisible labor reaches its nadir: when we, driving on roads they have built, offering our toddlers the blueberries they have plucked, eating the meat they have slaughtered and cleaned and processed, ask: “Should we or should we not pardon them for their work?”A week later, my husband and I returned to Salem to talk to families affected by the raid and try to get a bigger picture of its effects. The Centro San Pablo was quiet. The detained were still gone – perhaps for years. The released were lying low, trying to decide whether to return to work or pack up and head elsewhere. Several families had already left for Alabama, where there was work in the chicken plants.In the mid-afternoon, a family wandered in. The father, Francisco, was tall and broad-chested. The mother, Sandra, was short with a big gap-toothed smile. (Sandra and Francisco, as well as their children, are identified by pseudonyms.) Sandra was noticeably pregnant and trailing three little girls. They knew most of the small smattering of people in the room and said their holas and como estás before settling in.Sandra was waiting to see what would happen after her release, whether she’d get papers in the mail. Francisco, who had finished his shift at Fresh Mark just before the raid, was trying to decide if and when to go back to work.They had both grown up near the Guatemalan border with Mexico. When she was a baby, Sandra’s parents and grandparents had fled with her to the southern Mexican state of Chiapas to escape the massacre of indigenous peoples by Guatemalan government forces during a devastating civil war. When Sandra was six, her father died, and her mother remarried and started another family. Sandra’s grandparents moved back to Guatemala, taking her with them. She stopped school before second grade, and began work at age seven, harvesting plums, peanuts, hibiscus. “Trabajas por ti mismo,” she told me: you work for yourself.At 14, Sandra’s grandfather died, and her uncle took her in, but not for free. He was a sharecropper in Chiapas. He would take her and other workers in the back of a truck across the Mexican border to his plots of land, where they would shuck and degrain corn all day. She wasn’t paid. She was simply earning her keep. At 18, she decided to join Francisco, whom she’d met in the village, in San Diego.She walked for four days through the desert. Towards the end, her group ran out of water. They used their hands to scrape the needles from cactus leaves and crack them open. The water inside was so sour it was hardly drinkable, but it kept them alive.In San Diego, she and Francisco rented a room for $550. The room was in an apartment with four other rooms, each filled with three men splitting the rent. She bought a small refrigerator and the landlord charged her $25 extra per month for it. She took care of a little boy, and Francisco worked in landscaping, but the money was barely enough. When an uncle told her about rents in Salem – where, for around the same price, Sandra and Francisco could rent a whole house and their family could live alone – they decided to make the move.Francisco had already been in the US for 14 years. He had also started work in Guatemala at seven. In the morning, he would go to school, and in the afternoon his family would assign him a plot of land to work. He was not allowed to rest or do homework until finished, at which point it was dark. “I used to study by candlelight,” he said.He had been deported twice. The first was not long after he arrived he and four friends had the extraordinary bad luck of taking a wrong turn onto a military base. He had no idea at the time that he could avoid deportation because he was a minor. He told the authorities he was Mexican, so they sent him to Tijuana, where he crossed immediately back into the US.The second time, he and Sandra were in Salem and the three girls had been born. He was driving in the snow and the car lost traction and slid up onto a sidewalk, where it was stranded. The police officer who came to help asked him for his license, and that was that. In detention, he said to the Ice officer: “I have my daughters,” and the officer replied: “You’ll have to call them.”Telling me this, he sighed. He crossed his arms over his chest. I asked him if he wanted to stay in the US.“She wants to stay here for the girls’ education,” he said, gesturing at Sandra.“You’d like to go back to the pueblo?” I asked.“Sí, claro, sí, el pueblo,” he replied, like it was a no-brainer. When I asked him what they would do in Guatemala if they went back, he widened his eyes, pursed his lips and shrugged. It was absurd. It was like asking my daughter what she would do with a million dollars: an unimaginable concept. There was no work. He might, if he were scrappy, be able to run a small subsistence farm that would feed his family. But schools? And where he lived near the Mexican border, he said, narcos were constantly killing each other.We were interrupted by a waitress from Jalisco’s, a nearby Mexican restaurant that had provided free meals for the workers affected by the raid. The waitress, Isabel, was dressed in a teal uniform straight out of a telenovela. She had a pale, heart-shaped face and a sturdy sense of conviction.In Guatemala, Isabel said, the people don’t even have potable water. They live in cardboard houses with tin roofs. There is no money for anything, not even clothes. She pointed to a certificate on the wall, thanking Jalisco’s for contributing funds for a town’s school. The mayor of that town, she told us, had spent money on that certificate for Jalisco’s when the kids at the school didn’t even have notebooks.Francisco nodded. Sandra was on the floor, putting together a butterfly puzzle with Jorge and the girls.“I lived in rough poverty. I know what it is to live through hard times, to get by day to day.” Isabel had come to the US at 25 and started working in a restaurant. There were weeks, she said, when she had nothing to eat weeks she slept as much as possible, so she didn’t feel hungry. Eventually, her sisters had joined her here and they’d opened Jalisco’s. She’d married an American citizen. They had two children.“Here,” she told us, “It’s easy to raise a child who thinks they’re better.” She tried to guard against it, telling her kids, constantly: tú tienes todo. You have everything Sandra and Francisco gave their three girls American names.: Ashley, Tiffany and Kelly.The night Sandra was detained, she called Francisco, crying, saying: “Take care of my children.” He was sick with fear. He did not tell the children that their mother might be sent back to a country they did not know. But they picked up on it anyway. On TV, they saw police cars with flashing lights outside their mom’s workplace. The oldest asked why her mother wasn’t home, what was going on. Now, when they see a police car passing, they run inside and hide.Sandra and Francisco work six days a week: he on the am shift, from 6 to 2.30, she on the pm shift, from 3.30 to midnight. He walked to work at 5am so he wouldn’t have to drive. I asked what they did on the weekends and they looked at me for a moment as if trying to grasp the question. The one day they had off – Sunday – they woke, cleaned the house, went to Walmart to buy groceries, then headed to the lavandería to do laundry.That was it. That was their American life.Americans consume their labor, literally – in protein – and figuratively, in the ongoing enthrall to corporate profit. Yet a significant percentage of Americans want to give absolutely nothing in return. Not a fair minimum wage. Not health care. Not decent education in public schools. Not even the most fundamental right of legality.At a candlelight vigil for separated immigrant families in DC, a Sikh priest repeated: “We are not separate. We are not separate. We are not separate.” Greed grows out of separateness, out of a belief that I am more deserving of the luxury of comfort, of security, of my house full of light and books than the African who has crossed an ocean and a continent to get here, than the Honduran man who picked my cherries.Flor told me that while she was waiting in detention, she couldn’t eat, she couldn’t drink. She had no idea if she would see her children again. She had spent $15,000 to get her family here, to this tiny town in Ohio, where there was a job on the line. All she wanted was to work and be with her children.“I want to give them the best,” she told me. “You know?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d7d6c06dfac28ffe6dc927dba7edabb76cfd3cc/0_426_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95a0f2c07bc1636cb184cebcf2cd025c","title":"british airways criticised by lgbt groups over asylum removals","story":"Activists accuse airline that is sponsor of UK’s biggest gay pride event of putting profits before human rightsBritish Airways has been condemned for cooperating with the removal of refused asylum seekers persecuted for their sexuality while sponsoring the UK’s biggest gay pride event.A letter signed by LGBT rights campaigners, performers and businesses as well as several MPs calls on BA, a sponsor of Brighton Pride, to stop accepting contracts from the Home Office for immigration removals. “The presence of companies that profit off deportations is an affront to the vision of freedom Pride represents,” the letter says. “It is an added insult that many of those deported on British Airways are LGBTQIA+ people who should be marching with us at the parade but instead are brutally rounded up and ejected from the UK to face poverty, persecution and in some cases death.”Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the Home Office accepted only a quarter of applications for asylum based on sexual orientation, “despite applications coming from some of the most homophobic regimes in the world”. Abbott, one of the signatories of the letter, said: “Any airline that engages with the Home Office’s current regime is quite clearly putting their profits ahead of basic human rights.” Other signatories include the Labour MPs David Lammy and Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Matt Beard, executive director of the global LGBT activist group All Out, Zita Holbourne, national chair of Barac UK, and Mike Jackson, a co-founder of Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners. BA said it was proud to support Brighton Pride and it had a legal duty under the Immigration Act 1971 to remove iniduals when asked to do so by the Home Office. “Not fulfilling this obligation amounts to breaking the law,” it said.“We are not given any personal information about the inidual being deported, including their sexuality or why they are being deported,” the airline said. “The process we follow is a full risk assessment with the Home Office, which considers the safety of the inidual, our customers and crew on the flight.”Colin Yeo, an immigration barrister, said captains and airlines who refused to carry out immigration removals could face criminal charges, but in practice it was likely that the government and airlines had more pragmatic arrangements.  understands that the Home Office has contracts with airlines to carry out removals.However, she said, there were “certain circumstances” where the law required airlines to carry deportees. “We will always comply with the law and will continue to comply with this legislation,” the spokeswoman said. A spokeswoman for the airline later said it had never been forced to fly any removals under the Immigration Act. The Home Office would not answer questions about the exercise of its powers to force airlines to deport iniduals, nor about its contractual agreements with airlines to fly immigration removals. It said the UK was a world leader in handling asylum claims based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and no one found to have been persecuted would be returned to their country of origin.“However, where someone is found not to need international protection and has no other basis to remain in the UK, we do expect them to leave,” a spokesman said. “We work in collaboration with airlines to ensure any facilitated voluntary or enforced removals are carried out effectively, efficiently and with the welfare of returnees and other passengers at the heart of the process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a101504d3fb4a921747266c37bbe1e13d143194/0_311_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4541f8ee9c32641a2cfba348f023442","title":"google working on censored search engine for china","story":"Human rights groups concerned by reports about software that would leave out blacklisted contentGoogle has been condemned for supporting state censorship following reports that it is working on a mobile search app that would block certain search terms and allow it to reenter the Chinese market.The California-based internet company has engineers designing search software that would leave out content blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to a New York Times report citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. Such blacklisting would allow the company to reverse its move out of the country eight years ago due to censorship and hacking.The Intercept news website first reported the story, saying the Chinese search app was being tailored for the Google-backed Android operating system for mobile devices. The service was said to have been shown to Chinese officials. Google did not respond to a request for comment. The state-owned China Securities Daily, citing information from “relevant departments”, denied the report.As well as the search app, Google is reportedly building a second app, focused on news aggregation, for the Chinese market, which would also comply with the country’s censorship laws, according to the Information tech news site. The news app would take its lead from popular algorithmically-curated apps such as Bytedance’s Toutiao – released for the western market as TopBuzz – that eschew human editors in favour of personalised, highly viral content.There was no guarantee the project, codenamed Dragonfly, would result in Google search returning to China. Google already offers a number of apps to Chinese users, including Google Translate and Files Go, and the company has offices in Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai. But the largest of its services – search, email and the Play app store – are all unavailable.Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin has previously cited his birth in the Soviet Union in the 1970s as explaining his opposition to enabling Chinese censorship. “It touches me more than other people having been born in a country that was totalitarian and having seen that for the first few years of my life,” he told the  in 2010, as Google pulled its censorship from Chinese search after four years of cooperating with the authorities.The Chinese human rights community said Google’s acquiescence to China’s censorship would be a “dark day for internet freedom”.“It is impossible to see how such a move is compatible with Google’s ‘do the right thing’ motto and we are calling on the company to change course,” said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International. “For the world’s biggest search engine to adopt such extreme measures would be a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom. In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory.”GreatFire, a China-based organisation that monitors internet censorship and provides ways around the “great firewall” for Chinese residents, said the move “could be the final nail in the Chinese internet freedom coffin” and that “the ensuing crackdown on freedom of speech will be felt around the globe”.Speaking to the  in 2016, GreatFire’s co-founder “Charlie Smith” – a pseudonym – had praised Google’s initial decision to pull out of China in 2010 over what it said were cyber-attacks aimed at its source code and the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.“I think people are going to be very wary and attentive to how Google goes back into China. And hopefully they’re going to show us that there is a way to go back in without having to censor,” Smith said at the time.“I would be disappointed, and I know that a lot of other people would be disappointed, if Google went back in and said ‘we’re going to censor our search results again’, because they’ve made that mistake already, and they should understand that the situation hasn’t changed.”Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b200a9175ea95ac2182321c792cc8e39d96e569/114_0_2551_1531/master/2551.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c03c6af1c9fb0ef1cd6dd059c3fdc44","title":"brussels in eu wide drive to combat voter manipulation online","story":"Initiative will coordinate efforts to tackle fake news and misuse of personal dataBrussels is to launch an EU-wide initiative to combat voter manipulation through social media, as concerns grow about the issue ahead of elections to the European parliament next May.Vera Jourová, the justice commissioner, said national governments needed to coordinate their efforts to tackle fake news and the misuse of personal data in micro-targeted political advertising.With Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon seeking to create a large far-right bloc in the European parliament next year, the commission is to publish plans in the autumn to encourage national regulators to work together to combat the manipulation of voters.The commission recently proposed an EU-wide code of practice on disinformation to encourage social media sites to limit the micro-targeting of voters and to make the funding of such campaigns more transparent to users. It also wants support for an independent network of fact-checkers, and action to stimulate quality journalism and promote media literacy.The autumn proposals are expected to build on these themes and ask regulators to work together, although member states often have starkly different approaches.Jourová said: “I’d like to focus further on better protecting elections in the light of the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal. Organising elections is fully in the hands of member states, but if only one country’s elections are at risk of being manipulated, this has an impact on our whole union.“We need to improve our cooperation on such topics at European level. We need to tackle the online challenges to elections head-on. Pressing issues such as political advertising online, transparency, equal access to media online and data protection cannot and should not be considered in isolation. We’ll come up with a policy paper or recommendations in the autumn.”The Oxford Internet Institute published a report last week that found evidence of formally organised social media manipulation campaigns in 48 countries, up from 28 last year.It said that in each of the countries there was at least one political party or government agency using social media to manipulate public opinion domestically, increasingly by spreading disinformation during elections, or government agencies developing their own computational propaganda campaigns in response to perceived threats from abroad.EU regulators attending a seminar in Oxford this year were told that the current efforts to regulate social media manipulation “remain fragmentary, heavy-handed, and ill-equipped”.Germany has been criticised for a law that requires large social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube to swiftly remove “illegal content”, ranging from insults to a public office to threats of violence, or face multimillion-euro fines.Lisa-Maria Neudert, a researcher at Oxford university’s computational propaganda project, who authored a working document for the event, said there was a danger that well-meaning policies in Europe could be seized upon by authoritarian states to justify repression of speech.“On the one hand, democratic countries are trying to come up with well-thought systems, but there is often some element of content regulation or criminalisation,” she said.“We are seeing regimes all over the world pointing to democratic countries and they are saying they are replicating those measures, but with very different applications. That is the big risk we see: how it is affecting democratic discourse, not only in democratic countries but countries with less democratic values.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b38bd35b81a41c009cb05b4d8f72eb081e62899f/76_398_4190_2514/master/4190.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cf7fa91a747d3896bc6db4012e411a3","title":"friday briefing holiday hunger prompts food bank plea","story":"Children go unfed without free school meals … US embassy in Moscow had Russian mole for years … and UK spy agency puts out puzzle bookHello, I’m Warren Murray and there’s quite a bit to tell you.

Can they escape his legacy?On the corner couch of a spacious room, a woman wearing a brightly patterned robe sits expectantly. The red hijab that covers her hair is reflected in a glass-fronted cabinet inside, a framed photograph of her firstborn son takes pride of place between family heirlooms and valuables. A smiling, bearded figure wearing a military jacket, he features in photographs around the room: propped against the wall at her feet, resting on a mantlepiece. A supper of Saudi meze and a lemon cheesecake has been spread out on a large wooden dining table.Alia Ghanem is Osama bin Laden’s mother, and she commands the attention of everyone in the room. On chairs nearby sit two of her surviving sons, Ahmad and Hassan, and her second husband, Mohammed al-Attas, the man who raised all three brothers. Everyone in the family has their own story to tell about the man linked to the rise of global terrorism but it is Ghanem who holds court today, describing a man who is, to her, still a beloved son who somehow lost his way. “My life was very difficult because he was so far away from me,” she says, speaking confidently. “He was a very good kid and he loved me so much.” Now in her mid-70s and in variable health, Ghanem points at al-Attas – a lean, fit man dressed, like his two sons, in an immaculately pressed white thobe, a gown worn by men across the Arabian peninsula. “He raised Osama from the age of three. He was a good man, and he was good to Osama.”The family have gathered in a corner of the mansion they now share in Jeddah, the Saudi Arabian city that has been home to the Bin Laden clan for generations. They remain one of the kingdom’s wealthiest families: their dynastic construction empire built much of modern Saudi Arabia, and is deeply woven into the country’s establishment. The Bin Laden home reflects their fortune and influence, a large spiral staircase at its centre leading to cavernous rooms. Ramadan has come and gone, and the bowls of dates and chocolates that mark the three-day festival that follows it sit on tabletops throughout the house. Large manors line the rest of the street this is well-to-do Jeddah, and while no guard stands watch outside, the Bin Ladens are the neighbourhood’s best-known residents.For years, Ghanem has refused to talk about Osama, as has his wider family – throughout his two-decade reign as al-Qaida leader, a period that saw the strikes on New York and Washington DC, and ended more than nine years later with his death in Pakistan. Now, Saudi Arabia’s new leadership – spearheaded by the ambitious 32-year-old heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – has agreed to my request to speak to the family. (As one of the country’s most influential families, their movements and engagements remain closely monitored.) Osama’s legacy is as grave a blight on the kingdom as it is on his family, and senior officials believe that, by allowing the Bin Ladens to tell their story, they can demonstrate that an outcast – not an agent – was responsible for 911. Saudi Arabia’s critics have long alleged that Osama had state support, and the families of a number of 911 victims have launched (so far unsuccessful) legal actions against the kingdom. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia.Unsurprisingly, Osama bin Laden’s family are cautious in our initial negotiations they are not sure whether opening old wounds will prove cathartic or harmful. But after several days of discussion, they are willing to talk. When we meet on a hot day in early June, a minder from the Saudi government sits in the room, though she makes no attempt to influence the conversation. (We are also joined by a translator.)Sitting between Osama’s half-brothers, Ghanem recalls her firstborn as a shy boy who was academically capable. He became a strong, driven, pious figure in his early 20s, she says, while studying economics at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, where he was also radicalised. “The people at university changed him,” Ghanem says. “He became a different man.” One of the men he met there was Abdullah Azzam, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was later exiled from Saudi Arabia and became Osama’s spiritual adviser. “He was a very good child until he met some people who pretty much brainwashed him in his early 20s. You can call it a cult. They got money for their cause. I would always tell him to stay away from them, and he would never admit to me what he was doing, because he loved me so much.”In the early 1980s, Osama travelled to Afghanistan to fight the Russian occupation. “Everyone who met him in the early days respected him,” says Hassan, picking up the story. “At the start, we were very proud of him. Even the Saudi government would treat him in a very noble, respectful way. And then came Osama the mujahid.”A long uncomfortable silence follows, as Hassan struggles to explain the transformation from zealot to global jihadist. “I am very proud of him in the sense that he was my oldest brother,” he eventually continues. “He taught me a lot. But I don’t think I’m very proud of him as a man. He reached superstardom on a global stage, and it was all for nothing.”Ghanem listens intently, becoming more animated when the conversation returns to Osama’s formative years. “He was very straight. Very good at school. He really liked to study. He spent all his money on Afghanistan – he would sneak off under the guise of family business.” Did she ever suspect he might become a jihadist? “It never crossed my mind.” How did it feel when she realised he had? “We were extremely upset. I did not want any of this to happen. Why would he throw it all away like that?”The family say they last saw Osama in Afghanistan in 1999, a year in which they visited him twice at his base just outside Kandahar. “It was a place near the airport that they had captured from the Russians,” Ghanem says. “He was very happy to receive us. He was showing us around every day we were there. He killed an animal and we had a feast, and he invited everyone.”Ghanem begins to relax, and talks about her childhood in the coastal Syrian city of Latakia, where she grew up in a family of Alawites, an offshoot of Shia Islam. Syrian cuisine is superior to Saudi, she says, and so is the weather by the Mediterranean, where the warm, wet summer air was a stark contrast to the acetylene heat of Jeddah in June. Ghanem moved to Saudi Arabia in the mid-1950s, and Osama was born in Riyadh in 1957. She orced his father three years later, and married al-Attas, then an administrator in the fledgling Bin Laden empire, in the early 1960s. Osama’s father went on to have 54 children with at least 11 wives.Osama bin Laden’s formative years in Jeddah came in the relatively freewheeling 1970s, before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which aimed to export Shia zeal into the Sunni Arab world. From then on, Saudi’s rulers enforced a rigid interpretation of Sunni Islam – one that had been widely practised across the Arabian peninsula since the 18th century, the era of cleric Muhammed ibn Abdul Wahhab. In 1744, Abdul Wahhab had made a pact with the then ruler Mohammed bin Saud, allowing his family to run affairs of state while hardline clerics defined the national character.The modern day kingdom, proclaimed in 1932, left both sides – the clerics and the rulers – too powerful to take the other on, locking the state and its citizens into a society defined by arch-conservative views: the strict segregation of non-related men and women uncompromising gender roles an intolerance of other faiths and an unfailing adherence to doctrinal teachings, all rubber-stamped by the House of Saud.Many believe this alliance directly contributed to the rise of global terrorism. Al-Qaida’s worldview – and that of its offshoot, Islamic State (Isis) – were largely shaped by Wahhabi scriptures and Saudi clerics were widely accused of encouraging a jihadist movement that grew throughout the 1990s, with Osama bin Laden at its centre.In 2018, Saudi’s new leadership wants to draw a line under this era and introduce what bin Salman calls “moderate Islam”. This he sees as essential to the survival of a state where a large, restless and often disaffected young population has, for nearly four decades, had little access to entertainment, a social life or inidual freedoms. Saudi’s new rulers believe such rigid societal norms, enforced by clerics, could prove fodder for extremists who tap into such feelings of frustration.Reform is beginning to creep through many aspects of Saudi society among the most visible was June’s lifting of the ban on women drivers. There have been changes to the labour markets and a bloated public sector cinemas have opened, and an anti-corruption drive launched across the private sector and some quarters of government. The government also claims to have stopped all funding to Wahhabi institutions outside the kingdom, which had been supported with missionary zeal for nearly four decades.Such radical shock therapy is slowly being absorbed across the country, where communities conditioned to decades of uncompromising doctrine don’t always know what to make of it. Contradictions abound: some officials and institutions eschew conservatism, while others wholeheartedly embrace it. Meanwhile, political freedoms remain off-limits power has become more centralised and dissent is routinely crushed.Bin Laden’s legacy remains one of the kingdom’s most pressing issues. I meet Prince Turki al-Faisal, who was the head of Saudi intelligence for 24 years, between 1977 and 1 September 2001 (10 days before the 911 attacks), at his villa in Jeddah. An erudite man now in his mid-70s, Turki wears green cufflinks bearing the Saudi flag on the sleeves of his thobe. “There are two Osama bin Ladens,” he tells me. “One before the end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, and one after it. Before, he was very much an idealistic mujahid. He was not a fighter. By his own admission, he fainted during a battle, and when he woke up, the Soviet assault on his position had been defeated.”As Bin Laden moved from Afghanistan to Sudan, and as his links to Saudi Arabia soured, it was Turki who spoke with him on behalf of the kingdom. In the wake of 911, these direct dealings came under intense scrutiny. Then – and 17 years later – relatives of some of the 2,976 killed and more than 6,000 wounded in New York and Washington DC refuse to believe that a country that had exported such an arch-conservative form of the faith could have nothing to do with the consequences.“He had a poker face,” Turki continues. “He never grimaced, or smiled. In 1992, 1993, there was a huge meeting in Peshawar organised by Nawaz Sharif’s government.” Bin Laden had by this point been given refuge by Afghan tribal leaders. “There was a call for Muslim solidarity, to coerce those leaders of the Muslim world to stop going at each other’s throats. I also saw him there. Our eyes met, but we didn’t talk. He didn’t go back to the kingdom. He went to Sudan, where he built a honey business and financed a road.”Bin Laden’s advocacy increased in exile. “He used to fax statements to everybody. He was very critical. There were efforts by the family to dissuade him – emissaries and such – but they were unsuccessful. It was probably his feeling that he was not taken seriously by the government.”By 1996, Bin Laden was back in Afghanistan. Turki says the kingdom knew it had a problem and wanted him returned. He flew to Kandahar to meet with the then head of the Taliban, Mullah Omar. “He said, ‘I am not averse to handing him over, but he was very helpful to the Afghan people.’ He said Bin Laden was granted refuge according to Islamic dictates.” Two years later, in September 1998, Turki flew again to Afghanistan, this time to be robustly rebuffed. “At that meeting, he was a changed man,” he says of Omar. “Much more reserved, sweating profusely. Instead of taking a reasonable tone, he said, ‘How can you persecute this worthy man who dedicated his life to helping Muslims?’” Turki says he warned Omar that what he was doing would harm the people of Afghanistan, and left.The family visit to Kandahar took place the following year, and came after a US missile strike on one of Bin Laden’s compounds – a response to al-Qaida attacks on US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. It seems an entourage of immediate family had little trouble finding their man, where the Saudi and western intelligence networks could not.According to officials in Riyadh, London and Washington DC, Bin Laden had by then become the world’s number one counter-terrorism target, a man who was bent on using Saudi citizens to drive a wedge between eastern and western civilisations. “There is no doubt that he deliberately chose Saudi citizens for the 911 plot,” a British intelligence officer tells me. “He was convinced that was going to turn the west against his ... home country. He did indeed succeed in inciting a war, but not the one he expected.”Turki claims that in the months before 911, his intelligence agency knew that something troubling was being planned. “In the summer of 2001, I took one of the warnings about something spectacular about to happen to the Americans, British, French and Arabs. We didn’t know where, but we knew that something was being brewed.”Bin Laden remains a popular figure in some parts of the country, lauded by those who believe he did God’s work. The depth of support, however, is difficult to gauge. What remains of his immediate family, meanwhile, has been allowed back into the kingdom: at least two of Osama’s wives (one of whom was with him in Abbottabad when he was killed by US special forces) and their children now live in Jeddah.Osama’s mother rejoins the conversation. “I speak to his harem most weeks,” she says. “They live nearby.”Osama’s half-sister, and the two men’s sister, Fatima al-Attas, was not at our meeting. From her home in Paris, she later emailed to say she strongly objected to her mother being interviewed, asking that it be rearranged through her. Despite the blessing of her brothers and stepfather, she felt her mother had been pressured into talking. Ghanem, however, insisted she was happy to talk and could have talked longer. It is, perhaps, a sign of the extended family’s complicated status in the kingdom that such tensions exist.I ask the family about Bin Laden’s youngest son, 29-year-old Hamza, who is thought to be in Afghanistan. Last year, he was officially designated a “global terrorist” by the US and appears to have taken up the mantle of his father, under the auspices of al-Qaida’s new leader, and Osama’s former deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.His uncles shake their heads. “We thought everyone was over this,” Hassan says. “Then the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying, ‘I am going to avenge my father.’ I don’t want to go through that again. If Hamza was in front of me now, I would tell him, ‘God guide you. Think twice about what you are doing. Don’t retake the steps of your father. You are entering horrible parts of your soul.’” Hamza bin Laden’s continued rise may well cloud the family’s attempts to shake off their past. It may also hinder the crown prince’s efforts to shape a new era in which Bin Laden is cast as a generational aberration, and in which the hardline doctrines once sanctioned by the kingdom no longer offer legitimacy to extremism. While change has been attempted in Saudi Arabia before, it has been nowhere near as extensive as the current reforms. How hard Mohammed bin Salman can push against a society indoctrinated in such an uncompromising worldview remains an open question.Saudia Arabia’s allies are optimistic, but offer a note of caution. The British intelligence officer I spoke to told me, “If Salman doesn’t break through, there will be many more Osamas. And I’m not sure they’ll be able to shake the curse.” • If you would like your comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication).

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Public health specialist Dr Gabriel Scally was appointed in May to chair an independent scoping inquiry to establish the facts in the CervicalCheck controversy when the screening service failed to tell women with cancer what clinical audits of their smear tests had found.The inquiry is examining the outsourcing of services to laboratories in the United States. It is also establishing the background to CervicalCheck’s failure to tell women about the audits and is looking at what the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and its then chief executive Tony O’Brien knew.One of the issues the inquiry is focusing on is the disclosure of information to the patients, what decisions were made and how they were implemented.He interviewed Vicky Phelan, whose High Court case revealed the controversy and a number of other women affected.Dr Scally, who is expected to report at the end of August or early September, had expressed frustration at the difficulty in getting co-operation from the HSE and access to documentation.The Scally inquiry is intended to be the basis for setting up a commission of inquiry.Legislation to establish the commission will be brought to the Dáil and Seanad in the autumn session. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made a commitment that the commission will be held in public. When the controversy first emerged, a clinical independent review was offered to the 221 women diagnosed with cervical cancer who learned only after the High Court case brought by Vicky Phelan that they should have received an earlier intervention.A team of expert international cytopathologists from the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists was appointed to undertake a clinical review of the smears of all women in Ireland who were diagnosed with cancer in the past 10 years.There are an estimated 3,000 women in this category, about 1,800 of whom have a screening history and went to CervicalCheck.Minister for Health Simon Harris said that of the 1,800, about 1,400 women’s cases had already been audited by CervicalCheck.The UK experts advised that all women should be inidually asked for their consent to have their cases reviewed – for each woman to have her own screening history independently, externally reviewed and to receive a report of that review. It was first reported that the review would be concluded by the end of May but the HSE insisted it had always said would take between four to six months.The preliminary work to establish the commission is near completion and letters are expected to start being sent next week.High Court judge Charles Meenan has been asked to examine compensation options, including a redress scheme, that avoid a court process, for women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy.Mr Justice Meenan will consider alternatives in the wake of the latest development in the controversy over the breakdown of mediation and women being forced to go to court and face an adversarial situation to resolve their cases after reports of “legal aggression” by the laboratories involved.The Government had planned to seek settlements by mediation and pursue the labs for damages to ensure the women did not have to go to trial. Mr Justice Meenan has been asked to “assess the management of cases, liability and quantum that arise, in conjunction with the State Claims Agency and other relevant bodies (State parties, laboratories, insurers, indemnifiers and affected parties)”, a Government statement said.His report is to recommend a way through which cases can be resolved “in a sensitive and timely manner, that is appropriate to these cases involving complex liability issues and multiple parties, outside of adversarial court processes”.The judge will seek the views of women with cervical cancer and their families and report back within two months."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Background: New inquiry examining outsourcing of services to labs in United StatesConsumers reluctant to switch insurer despite potential savings, watchdog findsBarnier signals willingness to \u0026lsquoimprove the text\u0026rsquo of backstop agreement on Northern Ireland\u0026lsquoBlanket\u0026rsquo traffic restrictions will hurt city centre businesses, restaurant group saysDoctor fears court hearing could trigger seizure in man, judge saysCo Mayo town making final preparations for papal visit to Knock Shrine on August 26thDepartment of Health says \u0026lsquodetermination of negligence\u0026rsquo can only be made by courtFive people jumped from vehicle when it stopped near MountmellickKatherine Zappone \u0026lsquofocused\u0026rsquo on increased childcare investment in budgetVast majority of top-paid posts held by men despite policies to promote equalityTeacher seeks to stop the TCI from notifying the Garda\u0026rsquos National Vetting Bureau about an investigation into himAbuse survivors to gather at Garden of Remembrance during Pope\u0026rsquos visitUK government urged to bring forward legislation allowing donations since 2014 to be made publicPost network to be reduced to 950 offices after postmasters take retirement packagesDUP leader accuses former Labour spindoctor of \u0026lsquoliberally adding\u0026rsquo to the Belfast AgreementGsoc report cites serious failings in Garda investigation into 1996 west Cork killingFarmers say animals have been \u0026lsquomercilessly\u0026rsquo raiding feed supplies in the areaWarren Dumbrell who is serving life for fatal stabbing, claimed detention rights were breachedGarda forensic investigator says he did not note any warning signs or marking on approach to severe bend"},{"url":null,"title":"michael o leary people want to have strikes for the sake of having strikes","story":"  July 30, 2018Airline chief executive\u0026rsquos move last year cut his remuneration to \u0026euro2.3m   August 1, 2018Unions in four countries plan stoppages for next week as industrial action escalates   August 1, 2018Airline to meet British pilots\u0026rsquo union on Thursday "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3584913.1533248544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu to explore brexit deal on single market for agriculture","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA move allowing UK agricultural products access EU single market is  likely to be welcomed by the Irish Government as it could overcome many of the potential difficulties at the Border. File photograph: Mary TurnerBloombergThe EU is unlikely to agree to British proposals to stay in the single market for goods, senior sources say, but may be willing to talk about access to the single market for agricultural goods only when Brexit talks recommence in Brussels later this month. Such a move is likely to be welcomed by the Irish Government as it could overcome many of the potential difficulties at the Border after the UK leaves the EU. However, it would require the EU to move on some of its red-line issues, which it has not been willing to do until now. On Thursday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier signalled a willingness to “improve the text” of the backstop with the UK, echoing a declaration by the Taoiseach earlier this week of flexibility on the issue. In an op-ed piece carried in several European newspapers, Mr Barnier said the EU was “ready to improve the text of our proposal with the UK”. It is expected that a new text for the backstop – which guarantees no hard border even if the UK leaves the EU without agreement on a future trading relationship – will be tabled when the talks resume in Brussels in mid-August. The UK has rejected the EU’s suggested text which kept Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union in the event of no deal, while the EU ruled out suggestions by the British government that all of the UK could remain in the customs union for a temporary period. An Irish Government source said the process to revise the backstop was “nowhere near drafting”, but stressed Dublin’s willingness to amend the existing wording as long as it achieves the Irish imperative of guaranteeing no hard border. “They can call it the silly little Irish backstop that will never be used if they want,” said a Government source in Dublin. “That’s fine. As long as it does what it needs to do.” The Irish backstop is the last substantial part of the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK that has not yet been agreed. The agreement is due to be concluded by the October EU summit, but many of those involved expect the deadline to slip to November or December. All EU countries must ratify the treaty before it takes effect when the UK leaves next March. A key part of the withdrawal treaty is the transition period which enables the UK to remain under EU law and structures for a further two years, allowing the British government to prepare for leaving. The UK will also continue contributions to the EU budget during that period, averting a budget crunch for the EU. However, if there is no agreement on the backstop, the withdrawal treaty cannot be concluded. Without it, the UK would leave the EU abruptly next March, causing enormous disruption for both the UK and EU countries.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They will dine with the Macrons after a working meeting between the two leaders.May’s visit to Brégançon is the fourth high-level meeting between British and French officials in France in eight days. It has strengthened speculation that the UK is lobbying France to be more lenient in Brexit negotiations.The 14th century fortress is built on a rocky outcrop jutting into the Mediterranean near Toulon, and was recently the subject of controversy. The Macrons claim the residence needs a swimming pool because their privacy cannot be protected in the sea.Chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond visited his French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, on Thursday, July 27th. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt met the French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Tuesday. The Brexit secretary Dominic Raab saw European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau on Thursday.However, the diplomatic offensive may be futile. France is determined that the UK not be seen to benefit from Brexit, and was considered the most hardline EU country even before Macron took office last year. Hunt has also visited Austria, Germany and Portugal in recent days, and British sources say the diplomatic flurry is more a function of the parliamentary recess than a British desire to ide and rule. Unlike their French counterparts, British cabinet ministers are also members of parliament and must be on hand to vote. A similar spate of continental visits occurred during the February recess.The Élysée refused to comment on the Macron-May summit, although an unnamed source at the Élysée told the Financial Times it takes place at the request of Downing Street. A British source said the two leaders planned to meet for some time, and that the French, as owners of Brégançon, proposed the venue.An official British source sought to lower expectations. “There will be no outcome from the meeting. No statement. No declaration. It’s a standard working meeting.” The timing of the meeting is nonetheless significant. Negotiations between the EU and Britain are scheduled to resume on August 13th. Raab met with the EU’s negotiator Michel Barnier for the first time in Brussels on July 19th, after Raab replaced David Davis as Brexit secretary. Two important dates are looming: an informal meeting of EU heads of state and government in Salzburg on September 20th, and the October 18th European Council, when the EU and UK are supposed to finalise a orce agreement.Macron is unlikely to make concessions to May on Friday evening. At a time when the French leader is struggling to foster greater cohesion among Europeans, the fact that in two years none of the remaining 27 EU members has broken ranks on Brexit is a source of satisfaction in Paris. Britain has made overtures to inidual capitals, but the French have constantly maintained that Barnier is the sole negotiator. “I imagine Macron will tell Theresa May ‘we will be as constructive as we can, but Monsieur Barnier will tell you our position’,” said a European diplomat in Paris.“The French are certainly not going to undermine a French negotiator,” the diplomat continued. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU Commission, will leave office after the May 2019 EU elections. “If Barnier succeeds in the Brexit negotiations, he will be a strong candidate to replace Juncker,” the diplomat said.British relations with Barnier have been tense. In an interview with the Evening Standard on the eve of his trip to Paris, Hunt said that “the probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission, who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink”.The most difficult issue to resolve after the Irish Border is how to reconcile the inisibility of the four freedoms of the single market – free movement of goods, services, capital and people – with Britain’s desire for free movement of goods alone in a post-Brexit relationship. The modalities of the UK’s departure are the top priority for the EU, while post-agreement arrangements are a greater priority for Britain. British officials warn of disruption to EU economies if a deal cannot be reached. Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, told Le Monde that 1.2 million jobs could be lost in the EU.“The UK has decided to reverse 46 years of economic integration and thought it would be easy,” the diplomat said. “The only concession that the French or Europe can make will be window-dressing, to preserve British dignity, not to humiliate them.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/19/TELEMMGLPICT000022286395_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgmFsEjQK2M33nnfQ31Q2_50abONU5URiy4SaMmWMkLw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"emmanuel macron sets sights riviera camp david stage summits","story":"Emmanuel Macron wants to turn the old Riviera fort of Brégançon into a Gallic Camp DavidIt is a conundrum that has plagued many a French president: how to take a holiday without being accused of falling asleep at the wheel of the nation.Emmanuel Macron believes he cracked the compromise between presidential work and play by turning an old fortress on the Riviera into France\u0027s Camp David.The Fort de Brégançon, where Mr Macron is hosting Theresa May to discuss her Chequers plan for Brexit on Friday, is perched on a rocky outcrop overlooking the Mediterranean and Porquerolles islands, with its own helipad and private beach surrounded by vineyards.A military fortress for centuries, Charles de Gaulle turned it into an official residence in 1968.

Disease outbreaks that begin overseas, as seen with the Ebola epidemic, can quickly affect the UK and UK interests.“This impact can be either direct, or indirect through the loss of regional stability negatively affecting trade, causing migration pressures and creating ungoverned spaces in which terrorism and criminality can flourish.”Pandemics | The cost of a global outbreakThe plan says UK aid that builds up health services in the world\u0027s poorest countries goes “to protecting UK citizens from significant disease threats and securing the UK’s long term national security.”Any new deadly epidemic is likely to come from an animal disease infecting humans. Around 60 per cent of all human diseases and three quarters of all new and emerging infectious diseases are these zoonotic diseases. Recent examples include Ebola and H5N1 bird flu.As growing populations encroach on natural habitats and developing countries demand more animal foods, there will be increasing overlap between humans, domestic livestock and wildlife that could see new diseases jump from one group to another.An outbreak infecting UK livestock of crops could also be highly costly and damaging, the strategy says.Global health - Major threats to UK populationThe strategy says that a deliberate biological attack on the UK is currently judged unlikely. But it says such an attack on the UK or its armed forces “are aspects of this risk picture that may become more likely over the longer term”.Conflicts or economic crises also risk increasing the threat from diseases as health services collapse and immunisation programmes halt for diseases such as polio, diptheria and measlesIn the long term, “climate change will also increase the likelihood of pests and vector-borne diseases spreading to new areas of the globe, as they and their carriers are able to survive in countries where environments would previously not have supported their circulation”.Mr Wallace said: “Britain is a global nation, open to the world and outward facing. This means we are exposed to these risks, both at home and overseas, but it also gives us the opportunity to work with international partners to tackle such threats at source.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pandemics and epidemicsMan charged with fraud over Grenfell Tower tragedyEurope heatwave: Eight ways the extreme weather is taking its toll ahead of continent\u0026#39s \u0026#39hottest day\u0026#39 Donald Trump rejects claims he was 15 minutes late to meet Queen -

Despite suffering with slight frostbite, he was said to be in good spirits. Geoff Lunt, the senior search and rescue officer, said Mr Harch would have likely used his skills learned in the Army to survive.We think he dug himself a snow dug-out shelter and that\u0027s helped in his survivability over these last few days, he told Radio NZ.Mike Robert, another member of the New Zealand Rescue Co-ordination Centre (RCCNZ), described his survival as extraordinary.Four members of the Wanaka Alpine Rescue Crew stayed with Mr Harch overnight as they waited for the weather to clear. Rescue authorities said they plucked him from the mountain on Friday in what they described as a snatch and grab mission involving three helicopters.The helicopters also transported out the four rescuers who had reached Mr Harch a day earlier and two more rescuers who were on their way to him.The rescue team left with the climber had provided warm clothing, tents, food and were well-equipped with emergency gear to keep the party dry and warm for what, is hoped to be, their last night on the mountain.Mr Harch had left food and provisions at a hut on the mountain before continuing the climb.A lot of climbers leave a lot of their equipment and clothing at a base camp and then make a fast ascent on the mountain that they\u0027re climbing and then come back down again, Mr Lunt told Radio NZI\u0027m sure he was suitably equipped to carry out that, but as to what happened, we\u0027ll find that out later.Please review our commenting policyMan charged with fraud over Grenfell Tower tragedyEurope heatwave: Eight ways the extreme weather is taking its toll ahead of continent\u0026#39s \u0026#39hottest day\u0026#39 Donald Trump rejects claims he was 15 minutes late to meet Queen -

In its quarterly earnings outlook, the group said nominal pay growth in the UK is set to hover around or slightly below its current level of 2.7 per cent over the coming months, which is says is “well below its pre-crisis average of 4.5 per cent”.This historically weak pay growth “in part reflects the fact that there is greater slack in the labour market than many economists previously expected”, the Resolution Foundation said. “However, wider evidence indicates that pay pressures have built in recent months as slack has reduced. Nominal pay has bounced back after a slight dip following the referendum, and has been above 2.5 per cent for the past six months.”Meanwhile, pay growth for people who moved jobs in the last year hit 11 per cent in 2018, the highest it has been since 2011, while for those who stayed with their employer, growth was stuck at 2.5 per cent, below the average. However, the foundation said: “Despite the growing pay premium for moving jobs, the proportion of workers who have voluntarily switched employment recently is well down on pre-crisis levels, with just 3 per cent of workers having done so in the last 12 months, compared to an average of 4 per cent in the years before the crisis.”The Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis could indicate that its monetary policy committee sees the weak earnings growth recorded recently as being “as good as it gets”, according to the think tank. More than half of UK people feel proud of their jobs, study suggestsPeople are happier at work – but nearly half of us may move onIf MPC members believed that pay growth had cope to improve further, “such a view would underpin the case for holding off on a rise until this stronger pay growth materialises”. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspStephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that, despite the growing ‘disloyalty bonus’, young workers in particular seem reluctant to make the move. “While overall pay growth remains weak, interest rate hawks may take the view that, bad as it is, this is still as good as it gets. Those holding off on rate rises may take the view however that recent small upticks in pay pressure mean that things can only get better,” he added.Figures from the Office for National Statistics earlier this month showed UK wage growth had slowed to its weakest pace in half a year in the three months to May. Average total pay was up 2.5 per cent on a year earlier, down from the 2.6 per cent rate in April and the slowest since November 2017.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/02/11/community-centre.jpg","title":"little ducklings nursery prevent extremism preschool ofsted inspection hove","story":"Created with Sketch.The pre-school\u0026nbsphas been told\u0026nbspto improve the\u0026nbspknowledge of its staff on safeguarding issuesClick to followThe Independent OnlineLittle Ducklings nursery is based in Hangleton Community Centre in HoveOfsted has criticised a\u0026nbsppreschool for failing to spot if children as young as two are at risk of extremism.Little Ducklings nursery in Hove has been downgraded by the regulator after inspectors judged that staff did not know enough about how to protect the children – aged 2 to 4 – from extreme views.The watchdog has called on the preschool to improve staff\u0026nbspunderstanding of the Prevent duty – which is a legal requirement to “prevent young people from being drawn into terrorism”.The previously “outstanding” nursery in East Sussex has been told it requires improvement in the latest report from Ofsted – which is partly due to “wider safeguarding issues”.“Although the manager and staff have reviewed some aspects of their safeguarding knowledge and updated the policies and procedures, not all staff have a secure understanding of how to protect children who may be at risk from extreme behaviours or views,” the report says.The inspectors said the nursery must “ensure all staff use the information gained through training to improve their knowledge of the ‘Prevent’ duty and wider safeguarding issues” in order to meet the requirements of the early years foundation stage and the Childcare Register.Ofsted also criticised the preschool for “weaknesses in teaching” and missed opportunities to develop children’s language skills and their writing.However, inspectors did also recognise that the nursery children were “happy and settled” playing both inside and outdoors and that “parents speak highly” about the care that their children receive.A spokeswoman from the preschool’s management committee told The Argus that she was “disappointed” with the Ofsted result.She said: “We are working closely with the early years team at the council who are supporting us to help improve our rating.“We are also working alongside Ofsted and informing them of our plans for improvement which includes refreshing staff training on safeguarding and risk.”UK news in picturesBrexit Minister Dominic Raab is welcomed by French Minister attached to the Foreign Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau prior to a meeting in ParisDemonstrators against Tommy Robinson outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the  former English Defence League leader has been freed on bail by the Court of Appeal after winning a challenge against a finding of contempt of courtFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

The first hike in more than nine years comes after much anticipation from markets, which were pricing in a 90 per cent chance of a rate increase ahead of the announcement, but few specific signals from the Bank. The monetary policy committee voted unanimously, 9-0, to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points, and said future increases are “likely to be at a gradual pace and to a limited extent”.The MPC added that it “continues to recognise that the economic outlook could be influenced significantly by the response of households, businesses and financial markets to developments related to the process of EU withdrawal”.The pound had been trading down 0.4 per cent against the dollar ahead of the announcement, but sharply began to reverse those losses just after midday. Threadneedle Street upgraded its growth predictions for the UK economy to an estimate of 1.8 per cent in 2019, up from the 1.7 per cent predicted in May. The Bank also reported that inflation rose to 2.4 per cent in June, above the 2 per cent target due to “ external cost pressures resulting from the effects of sterling’s past depreciation and higher energy prices”.Business groups hit out at the decision to hike rates, saying the move risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty.What would an interest rate rise mean for household finances?Ten things you should know about interest ratesBank of England deputy governor warns against rate riseWhen the BoE’s rate-setting committee last met, three of nine members voted for a rise to 0.75 per cent.

Interest rates fell from 5 per cent to 0.5 per cent in the period between October 2008 and March 2009 when Britain was in the grips of recession. The base rate remained there until August 2016 when, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, the Bank cut it again, to 0.25 percent.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil?

Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

with extreme weatherBut the firm warned there was still a possibility of restrictions if more rain did not arrive in the coming weeks.Dr Martin Padley, water services director, said: “Given the improved position, helped by recent rainfall, we do not want to inconvenience customers unnecessarily at this time.“However, the long-range forecast from the Met Office is one of relatively dry weather into the autumn, so future restrictions are still a possibility if more rain doesn’t arrive.”In the southeast, Thames Water urged customers to save water as temperatures are set to soar beyond 30C again this weekend, pushing up demand.Andrew Tucker, water efficiency manager at Thames Water, said: “There is plenty of water to go around but the sheer volume of water being used all at the same time across our 20,000km of pipes means it’s a challenge for us to produce it quick enough to meet demand.”He said dozens of teams hit the streets in July to find and repair leaks as demand surged in the hot weather, with more than 1,000 being repaired a week, while offering to fix leaks on customer pipes for free.“We don’t want to stop anyone enjoying our water but instead urge everyone to make some really small changes like using paddling pool water to give the plants a drink and using a watering can instead of a hose or sprinkler,” he said.While London is set to sizzle again, the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will enjoy temperatures in the mid-20s, with scatterings of rain.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to

The cutting-edge study sheds a remarkable light on the geographical origins of the Neolithic community that first constructed the ancient site.Complex tests carried out on 25 Neolithic people who were buried at or following the time of the initial construction of the now world-famous monument, have revealed that 10 of them lived nowhere near Stonehenge, but in western Britain, and that half of those 10 potentially came from southwest Wales (where the earliest Stonehenge monoliths came from).The other 15 could be local to Stonehenge, Wiltshire-origin iniduals, or the children of\u0026nbspother descendants of migrants from the west. All the remains were cremations.UCL)Up until now, it has always been assumed that it was not possible to carry out place-of-origin tests on burned bones – but recent research at Oxford University by\u0026nbspBelgian scientist, Dr Christophe Snoeck of the Free University of Brussels, has now discovered that the act of cremation actually crystallises a bone’s structure and prevents the crucial origin-indicating isotope evidence from being contaminated by isotopic signals in the surrounding soil.The cremated remains from Stonehenge of the 10 iniduals of probable western British origin, were buried at various stages between the 33rd\u0026nbspcentury BC and the 28th century BC.Half of them (mainly from the 33rd-30th century BC) were probably from west Wales, while others (mainly from the 30th-28th century BC) were probably associated with places between west Wales and Gloucestershire. It’s likely that they were a\u0026nbsproughly even mix of males and females and that they were of high social status. In all the cases, it is not known whether the iniduals died shortly before all or parts of their cremated remains were transported to Stonehenge – or whether they were revered ancestors who had died several generations earlier.Although the geographically intermediate examples hint at there being a well-worn prehistoric land route between west Wales and Stonehenge, nobody yet knows exactly how the stones (and the cremated remains) were transported. Sea and land routes are both possible.The most likely sequence of events suggested by this and other research s literally thousands of years.bluestone quarries, at Carn Goedog, Pembrokeshore, west Wales (Adam Stanford, Aerial-Cam Ltd)Long before Stonehenge itself was built, the area had become ceremonially and ritually important by at least 4000BC.The site had at least one or two large natural sarsen stones which may\u0026nbsphave been used as a focus for pre-Stonehenge ritual activity.Ancient British stone circles were used for ‘Neolithic parties’Stonehenge tunnel \u0027could destroy traces of human life from Ice Age\u0027Ancient Italian Stonehenge accidentally discovered by friendsScientists claim Stonehenge used to be in WalesBy at least 3500BC, elites from western Britain (or at least with western British, potentially south Welsh, connections) began to be associated with the developing sacred landscape of the area.Then in around 3000BC, western British people (from southwest Wales) further developed their links with the Wiltshire area, by transporting dozens of large stones (and the cremated remains of many of their dead) from southwest Wales to a site they had earmarked for the creation of the first version of Stonehenge.Archaeologists now believe that the stones may well have originally been from a stone circle or other monument in southwest Wales which was entirely “uprooted” and transported some 200 miles to Wiltshire and re-erected as a stone circle there.33BC and 28BC\u0026nbsp(Christie Willis, UCL)The recent scientific analysis of the Stonehenge cremated bones (that appear to have been buried adjacent to the newly re-erected stones) is now helping to reveal the origins of the community, which appears to have actually built the earliest version of the\u0026nbspmonument.It is the strontium and carbon isotopic signatures in the cremated bone material that suggest a western British origin for the 10 iniduals\u0026nbsp– and definitely not from the Stonehenge area. The carbon signal, absorbed into the bones from the timber used in the funerary pyre, also suggests a Western or non-local origin.Geologically, previous research has shown that the stones (so-called bluestones or dolerite, used for the early phase of Stonehenge) also came from western Britain (in this case, the Preseli mountains in southwest Wales). Archaeological investigations have now pinpointed the quarries they actually came from – and when they were quarried (some time between the 34th and the 32nd century BC).“The new isotopic evidence shows the scale and frequency of interactions between communities hundreds of miles apart,” said one of the project’s leaders, John Pouncett of Oxford University’s School of Archaeology.“In the past, the research focus at Stonehenge has mainly been on the stones themselves. Now we are beginning to make tremendous progress in understanding the people and the community which built Stonehenge,” said the project’s osteologist, Christina Willis of University College London’s Institute of Archaeology.UCL)The research was carried out by archaeologists and other scientists from the University of Oxford, UCL, the Free University of Brussels, and the Museum of Natural History in Paris and is being published\u0026nbsptoday by the online\u0026nbspjournal\u0026nbspNature Scientific Reports.The ever-increasing body of evidence suggesting Stonehenge and the original Stonehenge community’s western British origins has substantial implications for our understanding of British prehistory.Firstly, it demonstrates the extremely broad geographical horizons that the builders of Stonehenge had. It shows that, despite agriculture increasingly tying people to the land, at least certain sections of society were well travelled and almost certainly had family connections spread across thousands of square miles.Secondly, it shows the lengths that prehistoric people were prepared to go to achieve seemingly non-utilitarian objectives – i.e. the realisation of spiritual or ceremonial aspirations.Thirdly, it suggests the possibility that the western origin of Stonehenge was so\u0026nbspimportant and memorable that it was celebrated across the millennia through collective memory and epic storytelling passed on across the generations. Potential evidence of this is\u0026nbspthe Arthurian story of the magician Merlin, who transports the stones of Stonehenge from the west. The\u0026nbspMerlin story describes how the stones\u0026nbspcame from Ireland – but southwest Wales is certainly close enough to Ireland, and also has\u0026nbspimportant Irish connections. The story was first written during the medieval times – but may well have had its roots in prehistoric collective memory.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/11/rtx13fp1.jpg","title":"universal basic income uk labour poverty benefits poll john mcdonnell","story":"Created with Sketch.Findings emerge after Labour\u0027s John McDonnell told The Independent the party is expected to include a pilot in its next general election manifestoClick to followIndy PoliticsExperiments have already happened in Finland, Canada, Kenya, the Netherlands and Uganda Forty per cent of British people support the idea of\u0026nbspuniversal basic income and would welcome experiments of the radical policy in their local area, a new poll\u0026nbspclaims.The findings emerge after the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, told The Independent that Labour is set to include a pilot of the scheme in the party’s next manifesto for a general election.In their new 180-page report, the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures\u0026nbspand Commerce (RSA) say the concept is “rapidly breaking through into the mainstream political discourse”.What is universal basic income and how would it work in practice?Labour set to include basic income pilot in manifesto, says McDonnellJohn McDonnell’s universal basic income idea needs more thoughtLawmaker proposes a universal basic income scheme for ChicagoWhy is Finland giving free money to its unemployed?The organisation, which is led by Matthew Taylor, author of a recent\u0026nbspreport for Theresa May\u0026nbspinto modern employment practices, calls for locally led basic income trials and suggests it could combat rising economic insecurity.They claim this would give people the power to create an alternative to the “failed universal credit” payments\u0026nbspcurrently being rolled out by the Department for Work and Pensions.Although there are many variations of such a scheme, the general principle involves overhauling the welfare state by ditching means tested benefits and replacing them with an unconditional flat-rate payment to all citizens.UK news in picturesBrexit Minister Dominic Raab is welcomed by French Minister attached to the Foreign Affairs Minister Nathalie Loiseau prior to a meeting in ParisDemonstrators against Tommy Robinson outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, where the  former English Defence League leader has been freed on bail by the Court of Appeal after winning a challenge against a finding of contempt of courtFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

A quarter of respondents were neutral on the idea and 16 per cent replied don’t know.The findings suggested that 40 per cent of people would welcome experiments of the proposal in their local area to test how it works, while 15 per cent were opposed. A further 27 per cent said they did not oppose or support the idea.The poll also found that the\u0026nbspmajority of the public back a welfare state guided most\u0026nbspby concern for the poor and needy (54 per cent) rather than “stepping out of the way so people can stand on their own two feet” (5 per cent).Nearly half (49 per cent) believed basic income would also reduce the stigma associated with receiving benefits. But the polling also reveals that the\u0026nbsppublic is concerned about the cost, with 45 per cent worrying it is “unaffordable”.Andrew Painter, the director of the RSA’s action and research centre, said: “The universal credit experiment is failing on its own terms, while the wider welfare state is riddled with complexities and underpinned by draconian sanctions.“By contrast, our poll shows that in an era of widespread economic insecurity, policymakers have the public’s support to start exploring innovative alternatives to today’s failing and unpopular welfare system.“Basic income is no magic bullet, but with HM opposition exploring the idea and the Scottish government looking to pilot it with four Scottish councils, basic income is increasingly seen as one plausible response to modern economic insecurity.”The author of the report, Charlie Young, added: “As basic income schemes are tested and designed, we need to give thought to how they meet people’s\u0026nbspneeds and natural concerns. This poll shows there’s net support for basic income in principle\u0026nbspand that there’s an appetite for experimentation.”Labour’s finer details are yet to be laid out, but the trial in Finland, in which 2,000 participants took part, involved them receiving €560 (£490) monthly basic payment, equivalent to £5,880 a year.Mr McDonnell revealed to The Independent earlier this week that he had recently discussed the idea with former Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was “really keen” on getting a pilot of the scheme in the next manifesto.Asked whether he could envisage a pilot of basic income forming part of Labour’s next blueprint for government, he replied: “It’s one of those things I think we can get into the next manifesto and see, it’s worth a try. There have been pilots elsewhere. I’m trying to wait for the feedback.”He continued: “If you look at what’s happened elsewhere in other countries – and I think Scotland is looking at it as well – they are doing it on a small geographical basis in particular towns. Guy is looking at that now and coming forward with proposals.“It will be thrown into the discussions about the next manifesto – that’s one of the ideas that a lot of people are pressing for.”Populus interviewed a random sample of 2,070 UK adults aged 18+ online between 27–29 of July 2018.\u0026nbspSurveys were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.\u0026nbspPopulus is a founder member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rulesThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/19/21/pounds.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/19/21/pounds.jpg","title":"uk workers wages rise switch jobs interest rates resolution foundation","story":"Created with Sketch.Findings come as Bank of England interest rate decision\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineUK workers who switch jobs get highest pay growth in a decade, research showsWorkers have a better chance of getting a pay rise if they switch jobs rather than sticking with their employer, a study by think tank Resolution Foundation shows. In its quarterly earnings outlook, the group said nominal pay growth in the UK is set to hover around or slightly below its current level of 2.7 per cent over the coming months, which is says is “well below its pre-crisis average of 4.5 per cent”.This historically weak pay growth “in part reflects the fact that there is greater slack in the labour market than many economists previously expected”, the Resolution Foundation said. “However, wider evidence indicates that pay pressures have built in recent months as slack has reduced. Nominal pay has bounced back after a slight dip following the referendum, and has been above 2.5 per cent for the past six months.”Meanwhile, pay growth for people who moved jobs in the last year hit 11 per cent in 2018, the highest it has been since 2011, while for those who stayed with their employer, growth was stuck at 2.5 per cent, below the average. However, the foundation said: “Despite the growing pay premium for moving jobs, the proportion of workers who have voluntarily switched employment recently is well down on pre-crisis levels, with just 3 per cent of workers having done so in the last 12 months, compared to an average of 4 per cent in the years before the crisis.”The Bank of England’s decision to raise interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis could indicate that its monetary policy committee sees the weak earnings growth recorded recently as being “as good as it gets”, according to the think tank. More than half of UK people feel proud of their jobs, study suggestsPeople are happier at work – but nearly half of us may move onIf MPC members believed that pay growth had cope to improve further, “such a view would underpin the case for holding off on a rise until this stronger pay growth materialises”. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspStephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that, despite the growing ‘disloyalty bonus’, young workers in particular seem reluctant to make the move. “While overall pay growth remains weak, interest rate hawks may take the view that, bad as it is, this is still as good as it gets. Those holding off on rate rises may take the view however that recent small upticks in pay pressure mean that things can only get better,” he added.Figures from the Office for National Statistics earlier this month showed UK wage growth had slowed to its weakest pace in half a year in the three months to May. Average total pay was up 2.5 per cent on a year earlier, down from the 2.6 per cent rate in April and the slowest since November 2017.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/11/India-assam-0.jpg","title":"india assam register citizens bangladesh voting rolls","story":"Created with Sketch.Government claims that hundreds of thousands of people illegally entered country from neighbouring Bangladesh since 1971Click to followThe Independent OnlineResidents queue to check their names on the final list of the National Register of Citizens India has effectively stripped 4\u0026nbspmillion people from the state of Assam of their citizenship.\u0026nbspThe state has a National Register of Citizens (NRC), which includes the names of all those who can prove they came to the state before 24 March 1971 – the day before Bangladesh declared independence.\u0026nbspIndia has now released a final draft of a list of its citizens, leaving some 4\u0026nbspmillion people to prove their Indian nationality.Force India in administration but to see out rest of the F1 seasonMan accused of cow smuggling beaten to death by mob in IndiaIndia on brink of biggest gay rights victory since independence India tourism ministry launches campaign to highlight safety of women It says hundreds of thousands of people have illegally entered the country from neighbouring Bangladesh over decades and settled down in the northeast – a claim which Bangladesh rejects.\u0026nbspThe application process for inclusion in India’s national register started in 2015.

May\u0026rsquos diplomatic assault on EU leaders can unlock Brexit deadlock                May OVERRULES Home Office and demands \u0027BREXIT LANES\u0027 at airportsIt follows work by Economists for Free Trade which showed that the Treasury would collect \u0026pound80 billion a year based on the revenue created by moving on to the World Trade Deal on WTO rules.If this were to happen the UK would also keep its \u0026pound39 billion which had been earmarked as a orce bill to paid to the EU.The advantage of a World Trade Deal on WTO terms is that the UK is not bound by EU rules or committed to agree to its red tape and regulations, while it is able to strike lucrative free trade deals around the world.Mr Burrage, a member of Economists for Free Trade, has specifically attacked assessments made by the Treasury on a so called \u0026ldquono deal which he branded dishonest, incompetent and shamelessly partisan for suggesting it was the worst option.Theresa May\u0027s hand has been massively strengthened in Brexit negotiations according to new study  (Image: )The Treasury analysis is the basis for the controversial Chequers plan which would tie the UK to EU rules and make it hard to strike other free trade deals.Instead Mr Burrage has argued that going to WTO rules should be considered the \u0026ldquobest option.He points out that exports by the UK to 111 countries outside the EU under WTO rules grew by 2.9 percent between 1993 and 2015.This was more than three times greater than the 0.9 percent growth in exports to EU countries in the same period and one percent higher than trade with the 62 countries which have trade agreements with the EU.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at ChequersHe also pointed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\u0027s Direction of Trade Statistics report which shows that of the 22 largest value goods exporters to the EU over the years 1993-2015, 15 were trading as most favoured nations under WTO rules and seven under some kind of bilateral agreement.The group relying on WTO rules grew by 135 percent over the period and the one with trade agreements grew by 107 percent.More importantly, they grew almost twice as much as the exports of the 12 founder EU members to each other which grew by only 70 percent, and four times more than UK exports to the other eleven, which grew by a mere 25 percent.Mr Burrage said: \u0026ldquoMrs May could deliver exactly what she promised at Lancaster House, and stay well behind all her red lines without the least difficulty.EU countries\u0027 leaders meet on 28 and 29 June for a summit to discuss migration in general, the installation of asylum-seeker processing centres in northern Africa, and other security- and economy-related topics including Brexit.

The government could then concentrate on making free trade agreements with the EU and others over the transition period.His work reflects concerns that the Treasury has been rigging figures and evidence to push for a soft Brexit where Britain stays under EU rule.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson (Image: )Before he resigned as foreign secretary Boris Johnson described Chancellor Philip Hammond as \u0026ldquothe heart of Remain in the cabinet while accusations have been made that the Treasury has deliberately tried to slow down economic growth to support the case for a soft Brexit.Senior pro-Brexit Tory MPs have lent their support for a World Trade Deal if Brussels continues to be unreasonable.Jacob Ress-Mogg, the leader of the powerful European Research Group, told the : \u0026ldquoWe ought not to be afraid of a World Trade Deal based on a World Trade Organisation (WTO) solution which is how we do 60 percent of our international trade already.Former Brexit minister David Jones said: \u0026ldquoResorting to a World Trade deal would not cause any problems.Jacob Ress-Mogg, the leader of the powerful European Research Group (Image: )Former Brexit minister David Jones said: \u0026ldquoResorting to a World Trade deal would not cause any problems.Meanwhile senior Tory MP Peter Bone, the founder of Grassroots Out, said: \u0026ldquoI think we the World Trade Deal is now the best option available to us.Meanwhile, in Austria, Mr Hunt told his counterpart that a failure to get a deal is now increasing.The message is due to be repeated to French President Emmanuel Macron by Theresa May today.French President Emmanuel Macron with Prime Minister Theresa May (Image: )Ms Kneissl played down Mr Hunt\u0027s warnings that both sides could be heading for an accidental no-deal Brexit although she acknowledged that they were prepared for the different possible scenarios.Mr Hunt\u0027s visit to Austria coincides with the country holding the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, giving Vienna a key role in deciding the agenda for the bloc\u0027s leaders.Speaking alongside his Austrian counterpart the Foreign Secretary said: Austria has a special role because of its EU presidency and so all we say is, looking at your huge experience of foreign policy and historical knowledge, let\u0027s not make this one of those moments where a terrible mistake is made which we are still talking about in 20 or 30 years.Let\u0027s have a pragmatic solution that allows that deep and special partnership, friendship, between the UK and Europe to continue.In a Twitter message he added: We want the EU to prosper but there is a real risk of a messy orce which would be a geostrategic mistake.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism. Jezza even risks losing his beloved allotment in Jewish-voting Barnet.What will it now take for decent Labour MPs like Chuka Umunna and Yvette Cooper to admit Labour is not fit under Corbyn to be an alternative party of government?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’ll be biting your own tail off within three minutes.For if you’re not familiar with him, “Stew,” as he affectionately calls himself, is another of those left-wing comedians who sincerely believes his material is driven by his own overwhelming compassion, despite the fact he seems obsessed with money and clearly hates everyone and almost everything.This includes other far more successful comedians, like Michael McIntyre, their audience, his own audience, the Daily Mail, Tories, “posh men”, Donald Trump and, of course, Brexit.The thing Stewart Lee clearly despises the most, however, is himself.’Cos he can hide behind a persona all he likes, he’s smart enough to know he is just another privately educated Oxbridge graduate telling the people what they should think.He’s also, technically, a very talented comedian, who made me howl with laughter for about as long as he was impersonating Russell Howard.All the cleverly ­inter-woven observations in the world, though, are meaningless if a comedian cannot disguise his own unpleasantness and opens the show, as Lee did, pushing the same foul-mouthed party line you could hear from a thousand other useless, BBC-approved stand-ups.“It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe . . . c***s did as well. Stupid f***ing c***s.”Good luck selling out the O2, Stew.Mystery objects round, as described by Stacey Solomon’s son Zachary: “They’re louder than like a car beeping. They’re very annoying.

All gappy leers, awkward silences and ill-fitting brown suits, this lot were. My word, though, after the briefest of mobile phone interruptions, the sexual chemistry was fair zinging between Annabel Giles and her first date.“Was that your mum?”“No, my mum is dead.”“I’m probably the same age as your mum. How old is she?” She’s still dead, Annabel.If anything though, romantic developments were even less promising back at the girls’ villa on Naxos, where we learnt: “A goat escaped its pen and spent the night in Ingrid Tarrant’s room. There’s poo everywhere.”Whether the poo belonged to the goat or Ingrid, I’m still not 100 per cent sure, but I’m hoping the local match-maker flagged up “a potential bowel issue” with her first date, George, an absolute ringer forHarvey Weinstein, whose background caused a surprising amount of excitement.“He lives in Crete,” Ingrid squealed down the phone to her daughter.“So do they call them Cretins?” Only if he asks for a second date, Ingrid (ITV, Thursday, 9pm).Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is an orchestrated plot, backed by millions of pounds . . . a script written the day Remain lost the referendum.The plan was always to reverse defeat by throwing up endless obstacles, by concocting myriad excuses to de-legitimise a vote they would never have questioned had they won . . .  and by relaunching Project Fear to terrify the country about the consequences.Like minds among MPs and the media would amplify each other’s panic in a feedback loop reaching a deafening howl. And they are succeeding. A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities? What about the destruction of trust in democracy? The inevitable breakdown of law and order? Would riots bother them?

Tourists in Spain and Portugal clearly need to take care in such high temperatures.“Continental heat will move up to Britain from the south. The low 30s are possible from Friday to Sunday.“The South and East will be hottest and it will be a warm weekend for most, although cooler in the North.”The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Record-breaking heat in Spain and Portugal is forecast to approach 50C.“In Britain, Friday could be as hot as last Friday, with 34C not out of the question.“Then, as furnace heat over Spain moves northwards over the weekend, computer models indicate temperatures in southern England rising to 36C.  Europe is also set to experience it’s hottest day on record, with the current record set on July 10, 1977 in Athens with highs of 48C.Spain’s record is 47.3C, set in 2017 while Portugal’s is 47.4C, set in 2003.Temperatures across Southern France are also set to soar, with highs of around 40C expected within days.The worst of the heat is set to strike the Iberian Peninsula, close to the border of Portugal, where almost 11,000 firefighters and 56 aircraft are on standby to tackle forest fires. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424223326.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rod liddle column food shortage","story":"Stacking up the tins of beans and Fray Bentos steak and kidney pie ready for Armageddon and Year Zero?My guess is you’re not. And that you think the scaremongering from the Government is utterly ridiculous.Hell, the Remainers think WE’RE gullible. For having believed the “lies” of the Brexit campaign.But it is hard to imagine anyone could be quite so stupid as to really believe we’ll be short of food if we tell our European friends to shove their deal where the sun doesn’t shine.They even had a debate on Remainer Central (that’s BBC Newsnight to you and me) about what we could put in our sandwiches if we fail to sign a deal. Basically it came down to Kirsty Wark’s toenail clippings and Evan Davis’s nostril hair. That’s your lot.Do they really think we’re that stupid? We’re not at war, you know. We’re just leaving an undemocratic bureaucracy.Do these dingbats really think that the Spanish tomato growers and the Dutch pig farmers are going to refuse to sell us anything? Or that we would refuse to buy their produce? Get real.The debate about whether we should leave or remain in the EU was pretty shoddy. There was exaggeration and outlandish claims made by both sides.I never believed the rubbish about an extra £350million a week for the NHS. And if I’d thought we were going to do that I’d probably have voted Remain. If ever there was a waste of money, that would be it.The difference is, the Remainers believe all the crap that’s spouted by their side. Every bit of it.Just as they believed the economy would be wrecked within a week of the vote. When actually it has been doing very well indeed and is projected to do even better.Sky fallen in yet? Nope. Instead we’re busy sorting out new trade deals with, among others, Japan and Australia. Employment is booming, unemployment is the lowest for decades, wages are rising and inflation is coming down.And so the Project Fearmongers dream up another nightmare scenario which exists only in their weird imaginations. We’ll all starve! No medicines!The threats come from our own remainers — but also from within the EU. Especially (quelle surprise) the awful French.Have you ever known a people more clingy? Listen, mon ami — it’s over, we’re leaving. Our bags are packed and ready in the hallway.It was fun while it lasted (well, actually, it wasn’t THAT much fun) but now we’re going. Try to get over it. And stop the blackmail, you ludicrous little people.Jeremy Hunt — never my favourite politician — has at least started well as our new Foreign Secretary.Warning the EU that it will lose far more than the UK if there’s no deal.No kidding, Jezza.We import far more from the EU than we sell to them. There is not the slightest danger of those imports being prevented from arriving here. To suggest otherwise is utterly absurd.OH God, Madonna’s at it again. Showing off her a*** in a Versace dress.Lying on the ground in stockings with her baps poking out in Vogue magazine.Madge turns 60 in a few days, for gawd’s sake.

Riding a Stannah stairlift wearing a leather basque, with a Gucci colostomy bag.I’m not saying she hasn’t aged well – certainly better than me. But have some dignity, woman.She’s apparently moved to Lisbon to get away from Donald Trump. I think Donald’s well out of it.THE serial anti-Semite Jeremy Corbyn is in trouble again.He has apologised after hosting a meeting where Israel was compared to Nazi Germany.A meeting which took place on Holocaust Remembrance Day! It’s hard to think of something more obviously anti-Semitic.But why did he apologise? He still thinks the same thing.He has never met with a senior Israeli government member. He has gone out of his way to avoid meeting the Israeli Prime Minister. He has called the genocidal Islamist terrorists Hamas his “friends”. He has failed to take action against the virulent Jew-hating in his party.He’s not sorry at all about having attended that foul gathering.He’s only sorry it got him into more bother.So, an anti-Semite and a hypocrite.Salman repaid that kindness by murdering 22 children and adults at the Manchester Arena.The lesson? Disengage with these foul Islamist countries. Leave them to it. Our people have rights.And they supersede the rights of fundamentalist Muslim fanatics to claim asylum in the civilised, Christian, West.SO, the courts have decided that people who don’t necessarily want the right to die can have the right to die if other people think it’s best for them.What a bizarre judgment.This applies largely to elderly people in a locked-in state, that is a persistent vegetative state. If the doctors and relatives think it’s time to turn off the life support, they can now do so.But people sometimes recover from these conditions.

Probably not going to get much better, frankly.”Relly: “Oh, that’s a shame.”Doc: “Yes. And we rather need his bed for another old gadgie who’s about to pop his clogs. Did you like him much, your dad?”Relly: “Um…bit of a miserable old git, really. Cantankerous. Suffered from bad flatulence too, in later years . . .Doc: “Still does!”Relly: “But we’d be very interested in what his . . . you know . . . will has to say. If you catch my drift.”Doc: “Ah, indeed.

We have no sympathy.The case he jeopardised in Leeds had reporting restrictions, temporarily preventing details being publicised. They’re neither unusual nor a politically-correct cover-up. They’re to avoid prejudicing and collapsing other trials linked to it.Robinson blatantly flouted them, was in contempt — and admitted it.Yes, our legal system IS too secretive.

Look at the range of emotions it goes through.”The clip has been viewed over 52,000 times and had over 1,200 likes since it was uploaded yesterday evening.The clip begins with the blonde doll smiling, but as Alan rotates her left arm the doll’s eyes begin to move from left to right - and her mouth begins to open.As Alan continues to rotate the arm, Gilly winks and her mouth is squished up into a strange expression.The doll’s expressions continue to change, and as her eyes move off to the side her mouth begins to turn down in to a wary expression.As the clip ends, a simple wink creates a strange expression on the doll’s face - as one side of her mouth moves upwards while the other moves downwards.The final expression shows both sides of the doll’s mouth facing down again as it looks wary, and Alan moves the doll in to camera for comedic effect.Scores of twitter users were quick to share their unease over the doll.Debbie Mason said: “Chuckie prototype.

He said: “We all agree it’s ‘creepy’, and my daughter and her twin brother, they are seven, sometimes like to play on that angle.“So I think that is part of the dynamic, maybe a kind of strange attraction, or something like that.”He added: “It must have been tucked away for many years in her parents house.

We’re going to have to do the hard negotiating in Brussels”.He added: “The problem with no deal is they read our own media, and they see it can’t be done”.Business chiefs heaped pressure on Mrs May to cut a deal with a warning that one in five companies would consider relocating to the EU if her Brexit negotiation fails.The Institute of Directors also calls on the Government to speed up publication of its no deal guidance, which has been delayed until the end of this month.Its new survey of 800 business leaders also reveals less than a third have conducted any Brexit contingency planning.IOD Director General Stephen Martin said: “Many companies are still unprepared for Brexit, and it’s hard to blame them.“When it comes to knowing what to plan for and when, firms have been left in the dark.”Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable added: “With the prospect of a no-deal growing day by day, so too are concerns about financial instability and fears of job losses.“This can be avoided if people are given the final say on Brexit, with the option to remain.”Despite what sneering Remainers claim, Britain is an equal in these negotiations. Let’s act like it.Our huge economic power, and the might of the City and its importance to the EU, give us enormous clout if only Theresa May would wield it.First SHE must believe in it. She must sell Brexit to the public as the golden opportunity it is, to make Britain a prosperous independent country out in the wider world where 90 per cent of future growth will take place.We have a vast ocean of talent. We have nine universities in the world’s top 50, dwarfing the rest of Europe combined. The EU fears our success.The PM will never talk round the ­hysterical “People’s Vote” brigade clamouring to annul the first People’s Vote they lost in 2016. But millions of more sensible folk are ready to be enthused about creating a new partnership both with the EU AND the rest of the world.All they currently hear are unchallenged and absurd Remainer scares about the dire consequences of Brexit, especially a no-deal on WTO rules.None of it should hold any fear for us.And being ready for no-deal, mentally and physically, is vital to get from the EU what we always wanted: a trade deal that frees us from Brussels.The Government must get off its knees, fight for Britain and unite it behind Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now it has happened why is everyone so relaxed about it?In part, it is because that is precisely what the Bank and its governor, Mark Carney, had planned for. So much of their effort over the past few years, from forward guidance to speeches on this matter, has been aimed at trying to ready the country for the fact that borrowing costs would have to eventually return to normal.The message seems to have been received.On the surface, the statistics suggest that the country should be able to absorb the extra costs.For households which are net savers, the consequent increase in savings rates, after nearly a decade of near-zero returns, should come as an immense relief."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-national-newspapers_4378812.jpg?20180802221355 ","title":"iberian peninsula braces for 47c heatwave","story":"Portuguese authorities have issued a countrywide health warning, and alerts are also in place in 40 of Spain\u0027s 50 provinces.Beja, in Portugal, is expected to record a peak of 47C on Saturday.The temperature surge is down to a mass of hot air moving from Africa, and has been referred to as the first heatwave in the region this year.

It\u0027s hard, especially when it rains. Homeless charities in Leeds, including St George\u0027s Crypt, have offered James support and short-term shelter, but he is not prepared to accept it. They want me to go to the Crypt, he said, But I can\u0027t do that, me. I\u0027ve got to be in a room by myself. If you put something down in there, you can guarantee something\u0027s going to go missing. It\u0027s dog-eat-dog in there. The men haven\u0027t known each other for very long but when James found out about Steven\u0027s bleak situation, he offered him a pitch on the roundabout he now calls home. The former upholsterer, who worked at Knightsbridge Furniture for almost 15 years, could see that Steven needed somewhere to stay and he needed someone he could trust. We\u0027ve got each other\u0027s backs\u0027 here, he said, I wouldn\u0027t be able to sleep here alone. I would be too paranoid. Steven says he also suffers with paranoia and several other mental health problems and is fighting a long battle against drug addiction. He ended up on the streets last month, after serving a four-month sentence in HM Prison Leeds, and says he expects to be recalled to that prison soon.  But until then he will have to go without square meals and regular access to running water, heating, a functioning toilet and a bed. I\u0027d rather be back in prison, he said, You\u0027ve got everything there. You know where you are. You\u0027re working, you\u0027re eating, you\u0027ve got a roof over your head. Everything\u0027s there for you. When I was in prison I was eating three meals a day, but before the half a sandwich I had yesterday I went three or four days with nothing to eat. You start getting lethargic and weak. It\u0027s horrible. Hopefully I\u0027ll be all right before I get locked up again, he added. I\u0027m not looking forward to it, but I\u0027m not bothered by it. I know where I am in there. Steven said he made plans for life after prison, but shortly after his release he fell back in with certain people and f***** up. It all revolves around drugs all the time and then that\u0027s it, he said matter of factly. Life on the streets is also new to Steven, who has been living on the roundabout for about a week. He obviously doesn\u0027t want to sleep rough but he\u0027s glad that he has somewhere to go and someone who can watch his back. It\u0027s a good job I bumped into him (James), or I wouldn\u0027t have a clue what to do, he said. I\u0027m one of these people, if I don\u0027t have a drink I really can\u0027t speak, me. I\u0027m a really quiet person.  I don\u0027t like to ask questions, I don\u0027t like to ask for help and as you can see I use to self harm a lot. If it weren\u0027t for him I don\u0027t know where I would be now. Despite being surrounded by a seemingly endless stream of high-speed traffic, the men sleep with one eye open each night and the days aren\u0027t much easier. Soul-crushing boredom is a big problem for the pair. They talk, smoke, read, walk huge distances and often observe ants to pass the time. But eventually hunger gets the better of them and they have to swallow their pride and resort to begging. It was my first time begging this week, said Steven, It was so humiliating it was unbelievable, especially being from Leeds. Imagine begging and you look up and your mum is walking past. It\u0027s demoralising, added James. It\u0027s horrible anyway asking for money, continued Steven, But when people walk past you like you\u0027re a piece of s***. Sometimes you just want a bit of acknoledgement. At the end of the day, to tell you the truth, I would rather have food than money. The other day I was sat there for four hours and got \u0026pound1.20. The duo don\u0027t have much, but they still have their manners.

Writing exclusively for the Mirror, the former Cabinet Minister and Greater Manchester Mayor urges Chancellor Philip Hammond to release cash for roads and rail investment across the region. The ex-Labour MP’s intervention comes after the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, chaired by Mr Hammond’s predecessor George Osborne, organised a letter signed by 84 MPs and peers from all three main parties calling on the Treasury to pledge cash to revolutionise roads and railways in the North.  Partnership vice-chairman and former Treasury Minister Lord Jim O’Neill said: “Getting a true state-of-the-art transport network is absolutely key. “Affordable and quick trains connecting all key parts of the Powerhouse are vital to delivering on the goal of raising productivity both across the North, and with it, the country as a whole.” Mr Burnham tonight echoed the plea in an article for the Mirror. He says: “More than 80 politicians from across the political spectrum have come together to write to the Chancellor demanding \u0026pound100billion of transport investment in the North over the next three decades. “This isn’t some luxury we’re requesting – all we are asking for is our fair share.  “We’re coming together in the North – and our voice is getting stronger.” The Mirror told yesterday how pressure was growing for Mr Hammond to open the spending taps. And Mr Burnham links the need for investment with the ongoign row over rail chaos in the North. He writes: On Saturday night, at 9.40pm, I received an email from Northern Rail saying that many trains to Manchester Airport were being cancelled the next day.  The public weren’t told this until the next morning – when the cancellations were all happening and passengers’ days were being ruined. This is what we have come to expect from the train operators in the North. The travelling public are simply treated with contempt. It has to end. I’ve been accused by the Transport Secretary of trying to score political points on this issue. But it’s got nothing to do with that – it’s about people’s lives. I’ve heard story after story of commuters at the end of their tether because for months it’s been a lottery if they are going to get into work or not. Businesses are telling me about the money they’ve lost because of the chaos.  The Government does not have control of this – and they need to get a grip. We asked them for control of the rail franchises, as it’s always better when the people on the ground are in charge. Instead they offered us a partnership. Partnerships are great – but they only work when everyone plays their part. The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling couldn’t even be bothered to turn up when he was meant to be the main speaker at a Northern transport conference. That’s why action needs to be taken, and why I have written to Theresa May asking her to personally intervene and take charge.

Unfortunately, I am not laughing. In fact, the situation now is so crazy it is catastrophic and, instead of writing a new script, I am urging people to take back control and support the campaign for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal. I’m doing so because I believe that, over the last two years, our political leaders have let all of us down, whether we voted for or against Brexit. Two years ago, immediately after the referendum, we were told by both sides that the decision to leave was the biggest thing to hit the United Kingdom since the Second World War. It was a crisis, and what do we do in times of crisis? We come together. That is what we should have done. There should have been a cross-party and inclusive group to conduct the negotiations and we should have worked on a proposal that would, at the minimum, have appealed to a majority of those who voted in the referendum.  The last general election even returned a hung Parliament – a sign that the people did not think one party could do this on its own. Instead, what Theresa May has done is to limit the debate to the agenda of warring factions inside her own party. Everyone else – all of us – has been shut out. In the last two years we have seen no progress and, in that time, a whole new generation of voters, who were not allowed to vote two years ago, have now become eligible but have been forced to watch while their future is debated in front of them and they have no say whatsoever.

Heartbreaking figures from the Trussell Trust reveal its network handed out 74,011 emergency supplies to kids last July and August. Each contained enough food for three meals a day for three days - meaning more than 666,000 meals were provided to hungry youngsters in just two months. Demand for food bank supplies rocketed by 13% in the 12 months to March, according to latest figures.  The need for extra support during the summer is triggered by kids who would usually get free school meals needing to be fed at home instead. That piles extra pressure on stretched household budgets, forcing more hard-up families to seek help from foodbanks. Last May and June, 70,510 supplies went to children - so the summer holiday months saw a 4.96% surge in demand from youngsters. A report from Parliament’s cross-party group on hunger estimated the loss of free school meals during the holidays adds between \u0026pound30 and \u0026pound40 a week to parents’ outgoings for one child. Volunteers at the Trussell Trust’s 420 centres across the UK could end up feeding a record number of poverty-stricken kids during this year’s summer break. Operations director Samantha Stapley said: “Foodbanks cannot, and must not, be a long term to solution to hunger at any time of year.  “No one should face going hungry, and although our network will be doing all they can this summer to help families struggling to make the money they have stretch to cover the essentials, no charity can replace people having enough money for the basics. “There are changes we can make as a nation to help during the holidays, but if we are to protect each other from hunger whatever the time of year, we have to go further than that. “We know particular groups of people are most likely to need a foodbank, so let’s make sure no one is swept into destitution.

Dame Martina Milburn, who was appointed to a post left empty for six months, also rejected the idea that the gender pay gap was stifling social mobility and should fall within her remit. The former journalist who went on to hold senior charity roles replaced former Labour minister Alan Milburn who quit the post along with the rest of his team, in frustration at what they saw as the Tories’ lack of commitment to the issue. But Dame Martina denied the impact of devastating cuts on life chances. “I don’t think the stats show that it has, actually, oddly, because you would think that it would, but as I understand it social mobility has been quite flat for a long time,” she said in an interview with HuffPost UK. Her comments will alarm many of those who have been dismayed by the government’s seeming lack of interest in social mobility - despite commitments made by Theresa May.  And they would seem to contradict evidence from respected thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) which published evidence last November showing that child poverty is set to rise significantly between 2015-16 and 2021-22 as a direct result of benefit cuts. It found that absolute child poverty would increase by around 4 percentage points on the government’s official measure during that period with around three-quarters - equal to 400,000 children, attributable to benefit changes. The freeze to most working-age benefits means that around 7.5 million low income households will see their benefit entitlements cut by over \u0026pound500 per year in real terms. The limiting of tax credits and universal credit to two children means that some low income families will receive over \u0026pound2,500 less in benefits than they otherwise would have.  Research from the Resolution Foundation released this week found that child poverty is projected to have increased last year by around 3 per cent - more than previously thought. It blamed this on benefit cuts that particularly hit low-income families, including the 3 per cent real-terms fall in the value of tax credits and child benefit. However it also found that in contrast to rises in poverty, inequality has remained broadly flat since 2010-11. The IFS also found earlier this month that per-pupil spending on schools had fallen by 8% since 2010. Since education is widely seen as key in improving life chances this would also challenge Dame Martina’s separation of government cuts from the drop in social mobility outlined by the outgoing commission in a damning report last year. Theresa May vowed to tackle the “burning injustices” in society when she became prime minister was widely criticised for taking so long to appoint a successor to Mr Milburn who quit in December. Recently-appointed Education Secretary Damian Hinds has renewed the government’s commitment by pledging to halve the number of children who start school without basic communication skills by 2028. But Labour have been keen to point out that the Tories have slashed the funding for Sure Start centres by half which were designed to help parents support their kids in the crucial early years.

It follows reports that the Labour leader planned to hold an event at the museum, in Camden, London, tomorrow afternoon. A senior Labour source confirmed no event is planned for Friday, and no event next week had been confirmed. But a sources at the museum said talks are ongoing.  Abigail Morris, the museum\u0027s chief executive, told the Jewish Chronicle the museum would absolutely be open to hosting the Labour leader for an event as long as it is done carefully and sensitively.  She added: We are still trying to work out what [Mr Corbyn’s office] is asking from us — whether it is a discussion, a statement or a speech. “Things are very delicate at the moment. But the Jewish Museum is all about building bridges, and sometimes that’s hard.  “We would want to be part of a healing process — not something that will make things worse. We are very proud of being a cross-communal space and we want to be a place where positive dialogue can take place.” There has been speculation Mr Corbyn intends to use the speech to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u0027s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism in full. Labour\u0027s row is about its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism. This is a set of rules, approved by Labour\u0027s NEC, to decide if a member\u0027s remarks are racist and should get them expelled. Critics are angry that Labour\u0027s code does not match a widely-accepted code from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA). So what\u0027s the difference? Labour has adopted the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, word for word. But it has not adopted all the IHRA\u0027s examples of possible anti-Semitic behaviour. The four examples Labour has not adopted are:  Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel\u0027s existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis.  Supporters say this is because Labour\u0027s examples are likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic. The IHRA examples are only anti-Semitic once the overall context is taken into account - a weaker threshold. Labour\u0027s code also adds insults like kike and yid to the examples. Critics say the discrepancy means those using conspiracy theories or comparing Israel to Nazi Germany will go unpunished."},{"url":null,"title":"rents rise 60 faster wages","story":"NewsRents rise 60% faster than wages across England - here\u0027s the top 20 areas where the gap has grown mostNew figures revealed by Homelessness charity Shelter, show private rents have risen by 16% since 2011.

As things stand, Brexit will come into force at the end of March 2019.  But it could be 2022 before you notice any difference - and the path to the door is littered with obstacles. Some believe Brexit can be stopped. Others fear it could bring down the Government. Here\u0027s a list of the questions about Brexit most people are asking Google for help with - and the answers as they stand. 1. What is Brexit?  Brexit is Britain\u0027s exit from the European Union. That means leaving its single market and customs union, cutting legal ties, ending the automatic right for EU citizens to move to Britain, and reducing or ending budget payments to Brussels.  At the moment it looks likely. There are campaigns with multi-million pound backing, such as Best For Britain, that are trying to halt the process as we know it. But stopping Brexit would probably need a second referendum. And while some recent polls have seen an uptick of support for that idea, there\u0027s very little political will from the people actually in charge for that to happen. Both Tory Boris Johnson and Labour\u0027s John McDonnell have warned of a public backlash if there was any attempt to overturn the referendum result. Labour has insisted it is not backing a second referendum. But several times, senior Labour figures have refused to rule out backing one in future. And many backbench MPs openly back a second referendum, or a referendum on the terms of whatever deal Theresa May manages to negotiate with Brussels - which they call a \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027.  Britain officially leaves the EU at 11pm on 29 March 2019. But a transition period has been agreed, which means almost all current rules continue until New Year\u0027s Eve 2020. Then there is also a customs \u0027backstop\u0027 (see below) which could continue EU rules into 2021, or even 2022. However, the deadline to agree the main deal is around October 2018, because it needs time to be agreed by MPs and the European Parliament.  4. When was the Brexit vote?   The Brexit referendum took place on June 23, 2016.  5. How many people voted for Brexit?     The UK voted 52%-48% in 2016 to leave the 28-nation body after almost 50 years. Out of an electorate of 46,501,241 people, 17,410,742 voted to leave, with 16,141,241 voting to Remain. The turnout was 72.2%  6. What does Brexit stand for?    The word Brexit is a combination of Britain and exit - meaning Britain\u0027s exit from the EU. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word was coined by journalist Peter Wilding in a 2012 blog for EURACTIV, a European news outlet. He told EURACTIV last year: The brutal truth of it is I wrote this blog post, and then promptly forgot all about it. “Until this summer I got a phone call saying that the Oxford English Dictionary were going to put it in [the dictionary], and I realised I must have coined it.  7. Why did people vote for Brexit?    Many many reasons. Some simply voted for Brexit as a protest vote to kick back against the establishment. For about a third of people, according to polls, it was mostly about \u0027regaining control\u0027 of immigration. For about half- including a small group of Tory hardline Eurosceptics - it was about sovereignty. They were concerned that Britain had ceded too much control of its lawmaking to Brussels, and fears the European project would lead to \u0027ever closer union.\u0027 And they object to supranational bodies, like the European Court of Justice, having power over decisions they feel should be made by us alone. Since the Referendum, the Leave campaign have been strongly criticised for spreading misleading information in a bid to influence voters. Among the misleading information is the widely discredited claim, plastered on the side of the Vote Leave campaign bus, that \u0026pound350 million a week could clawed back from fees we send to the EU, which could then be spent on the NHS. Another misleading claim used in Vote Leave advertising was that Turkey was on the verge of being admitted to the EU, which it was not. Vote Leave were also found to have broken spending rules during the campaign.  8. How to stop Brexit? See #2 above.   9. What is the EU?    The European Union is made up of 28 countries - 27 after Brexit - who have come together for trade and security. It was originally set up as the European Economic Community in 1958 with six members: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The EEC changed its name to the European Union (EU) in 1993. The founding states wanted to bind the peace of the Second World War and further economic links by removing trade barriers between the countries. The EU now includes the 19 eurozone countries who share the single currency.  The European Union is overseen by the Council of Europe - the 28 leaders of the member states. The leaders meet for a regular summits throughout the year and set the direction of the EU and decide major issues such as changing the treaty and foreign policy. They do not pass laws. The engine of the EU is the Commission. This is made up of 28 Commissioners, one from each country, and the President (Jean-Claude Juncker) who is elected by MEPs. Commissioners oversee the running of the EU, set budgets and tables legislation for adoption by the European Parliament. The European Parliament is made up of 751 MEPs who voted on legislation, elect the President and approve the budgets. To keep the French happy the Parliament is based in Brussels but sits for four days a month in Strasbourg. 10. How will Brexit affect house prices?

Meanwhile, British retailers with similar UK sales paid up to 20 times as much tax. One campaigner said: “We need to rebalance the system.” Amazon rang up record UK sales last year as its declared profits here soared three-fold – yet slashed its corporation tax bill by over a third. A Mirror investigation has found the online giant pays just a fraction of the corporation tax of its High Street rivals, levied at 19% on company profits  Similarly sized retailers such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer, John Lewis and Dixons Carphone declare paying over 20 times as much corporation tax while shelling out more than double on staff wages. Amazon’s biggest UK firm, Amazon UK Services, paid \u0026pound4.6million in corporation tax last year, its lowest since 2012. It was down 36% on the \u0026pound7.4million it paid the year before, despite declaring \u0026pound72million profit, triple that of 2016.  The revelation comes after boss Jeff Bezos, 54, was last month revealed to be the richest man in modern history, with a fortune of \u0026pound113billion, leaping \u0026pound41billion ahead Microsoft’s Bill Gates. The Mirror’s High Street Fightback campaign is calling for a level playing field for high street shops struggling against online competition. Alex Schlagman, founder of SaveTheHighStreet.org, said: “The high street is the UK’s largest private sector employer, representing hundreds of thousands of independent businesses not using complex offshore structures to reduce their tax bills. It’s in the interest of all UK citizens that we support the high street and level the playing field with large online-only retailers.”  Martin McTague, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “We need to rebalance the taxation system. As things stand, business rates are rising while corporation tax is coming down. “If we want to breathe life back into our high streets, that needs a rethink.” Filings by Amazon Inc in the US revealed the firm’s UK sales hit a record \u0026pound8.8billion in 2017, up 25% in a year. But its biggest UK company, Amazon UK Services which runs the firm’s warehouses and support services and employs nearly 20,000, only declared \u0026pound2billion of revenue. It is believed much of the rest goes through its larger Luxembourg subsidiary, and it is not known how much UK corporation tax it pays. Tax expert Professor Richard Murphy of City, University of London, said: “Amazon are still playing games in the UK. “In the only accounts they publish for the UK they’re declaring less than a quarter of the sale they really make here. It looks as though they pay less tax here than they should as a result. But we don’t know if that’s the whole story, or not. Amazon is still leaving us in the dark.” Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: “Our high streets are falling to their knees as a result of lack-lustre public investment, crippling business rates and no support or strategy from this Government. “At the same time they let corporations like Amazon get away with paying so little in tax.  “This morally bankrupt Government also watches on as Amazon’s profits continue to soar whilst its workers are forced to endure Victorian working conditions. “The next Labour government will implement thorough measures to crack down on tax dodging by the super-rich and big corporations.” Amazon insists it pays more corporation tax than the \u0026pound4.6million after stopping billing UK customers through Luxembourg. But it is refusing to reveal its total UK tax bill. The firm said yesterday: “We pay all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate.” Amazon also claimed that its corporation tax bill has been reduced as a result of generous share payments to staff, worth \u0026pound1,000 a year to warehouse operatives. It also points to billions of pounds’ worth of investment in the UK which has hit its profits. A spokesman said: “In May 2015, to ensure we had the best business structure to serve our customers going forward, we established a local country branch of [Luxembourg subsidiary] Amazon EU Sarl in the UK, with all retail revenues, expenses, profits and taxes due now accounted for in the UK.  “Corporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment. “We have invested over \u0026pound9.3billion in the UK since 2010 including last year opening a new head office in London alongside development centres in Cambridge and London.” Working conditions in Amazon’s warehouse in Tilbury, Essex, were revealed after an undercover investigation by the Sunday Mirror last year. A reporter found timed toilet breaks, impossible targets and workers falling asleep on their feet.  Ambulances were regularly called to the depot, where workers faced the sack if they failed to pack at least two items per minute. Amazon said: “Amazon provides a safe and positive workplace with competitive pay and benefits from day one. We are proud to have created thousands of permanent roles in our UK fulfilment centres in recent years. “As with most companies, we expect a certain level of performance. Targets are based on previous performance achieved by our workers.” High St rivals pay their way High Street shops, already struggling under punitive business rates, are often paying much more in corporation tax, wages and national insurance than their online rivals, a Mirror investigation found. For every \u0026pound100 spent at Britain’s five biggest online chains, just 9p goes to the Treasury in corporation tax, \u0026pound6.40 on staff wages and 63p for national insurance payments. But at five of the biggest High Street stores, it is \u0026pound1.50 in corporation tax, \u0026pound13.20 on wages and 99p for national insurance – more than twice as much. From the accounts of Amazon UK Services, it appears that for every \u0026pound100 spent by UK Amazon customers, 0.5p goes on corporation tax, \u0026pound6 on wages and 61p for social security. Amazon insists the tax bill is higher but is not revealing how much. John Lewis plc made \u0026pound10billion in UK sales last year, \u0026pound1.2billion more than Amazon. It declared a corporation tax bill of \u0026pound99million – more than 20 times higher than the \u0026pound4.6million Amazon declared. Its wage bill was \u0026pound1.42billion – nearly three times higher than Amazon UK Services’ \u0026pound530million. An Amazon spokesman said: “This year we plan to create 2,500 permanent jobs across the country in research and development, our head office, customer service and fulfilment centres, to bring our total workforce in the UK to over 27,500.” How much Corporation Tax does Amazon pay in the UK? We don’t know for sure. Amazon UK Services paid \u0026pound4.6million last year but it accounts for less than a quarter of Amazon’s total UK sales. Much of the rest goes through a Luxembourg firm which does not reveal its profits or how much tax is paid in individual countries. Don’t most retailers do the same? No. Most file one set of accounts for UK operations which show profit made and tax paid. Prof Richard Murphy said: “The government should require Amazon to publish accounts for all UK operations as if they were one company. Amazon has to do this as part of its US tax return. Then we’d know the truth.” Is its UK tax bill up or down? Again, we don’t know for certain. Amazon UK Services revenue is up 400% in five years to \u0026pound2billion but its tax bill is the lowest since 2012. Prof Murphy said in the US Amazon pays 20% but here it’s 6%."},{"url":null,"title":"britains best dressed 2018 revealed","story":"NewsBritain\u0027s best dressed 2018 revealed as Prince George makes the cut alongside the Queen, pop star Dua Lipa, and actor Daniel KaluuyaTatler magazine praises the Queen as \"the ultimate power dresser\", citing her fondness for \"bright block colours\" as well as her love of floral printsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Mapstone06:30, 2 AUG 2018Updated06:32, 2 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The Queen , the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex - along with the likes of pop star Dua Lipa and actor Daniel Kaluuya - have been named among Britain\u0027s best dressed for 2018.

Elizabeth Johnson, 23, looks back at her time in secondary school with dread as she was mercilessly bullied for being overweight. Despite the name calling, Elizabeth, from Durham, would hide stashes of crisps in her bedroom to eat in secret - seeing her weight rocketed to 20.5 stone. But Elizabeth, a teacher, finally decided to take action when, at size 26, she dreaded getting in a bikini on a planned beach holiday to Marmaris, Turkey, with a slim university pal. After becoming a regular at the gym and a keen meal-planner, the young woman has dropped to a stunning 11.5 stone - losing the weight in just a year. Elizabeth dropped eight dress sizes and was proud to show off her svelte figure on holiday in a bikini for the first time since aged five in August 2016, even next to her \u0027petite\u0027 pal.  And now the school bulllies who once taunted Elizabeth over her weight routinely chatted up on nights out - but she is always quick to tell them where to go.   Elizabeth, from Durham, said: It\u0027s a massive difference. I am delighted. The funny thing is that since I lost the weight loads of the lads in secondary school that used to call me names and take the mick, they\u0027re always the ones on the night out trying to chat me up and stuff. I tell them where to go straight away. A lot of my friends I had in secondary school I\u0027m not friends with now because since I lost the weight they just drifted away. I think they must have liked me for being the fat friend that was just there. I was the token fat friend in the group. I was able to go on holiday and wear a bikini and everything which I probably haven\u0027t done since I was about five. I used to hate swimming - I just hated it. It was a really nice holiday. My friend is quite petite as well but I didn\u0027t feel out of place. We\u0027ve got loads of pictures and I just look like her. I look the same size as her and everything. It\u0027s hard because it took me a year to lose all the weight and I saw myself in the mirror every day, so even now looking at myself I still feel as though I\u0027m quite big compared to everyone.  But then when I look at a before and after picture it just shows how different I am. It takes other people to compliment me and say I look good because I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a massive change. I\u0027m still the same person - I still have the same personality and like the same things. It\u0027s just my body has completely changed. As a chubby child, Elizabeth had been bullied at secondary school for her weight and always felt like the token \u0027fat friend\u0027 with her mates. She tried dieting and even joined Weight Watchers while she was still at school - but would always give up after a few months and the pounds just kept piling on. At her heaviest, Elizabeth was 20 and a half stone. But that all changed when, three years ago, she and her \u0027skinny\u0027 friends started planning a girls\u0027 holiday abroad. At size 26, Elizabeth was terrified when she realised all her friends would be showing off their figures in skimpy bikinis. Elizabeth said: I\u0027ve always been overweight ever since I was a little girl. Even in primary school I was trying to lose weight. I did get bullied a lot at school, particularly at secondary school. But I remember the local nurse had to come in and weigh the children and I was so stressed about this for months knowing I would have to get weighed at school.  Secondary school was just awful. Absolutely awful. I started weight watchers when I was in secondary school but it just never worked. I was in my second year at university and my friends all decided that we were going to go on a girl\u0027s holiday. My friends are all thin and would be wearing bikinis and stuff. I was a size 26 massive girl. We were going to go in a year, so I thought \u0027I\u0027ve got a year to do something about it\u0027 and that\u0027s when I lost all the weight. Elizabeth teamed up with mum Louise Jobson, 42, to shift the pounds and the pair food shopped and meal planned together to curb their snacking habits. Elizabeth imposed a strict 6pm curfew on eating and stopped stashing crisps and sweets in her bedroom. Louise even joined her daughter the first time she went to the gym - and the young woman was delighted when she lost nearly two stone in just her first month. Elizabeth said: You\u0027ve got to be in the right mind-set to do it. Because I was doing it with my mam and I had her helping me to plan meals and encourage me, it really helps to have someone there because she came to the gym with me for the first time. She\u0027s my best friend. I absolutely love her. I couldn\u0027t have done it without her at all. When I was losing weight I cut down meals and stuff and bulked it out with vegetables and salads. Now because I know that I don\u0027t want to go back to how I was. I still eat how I would usually but then I know I\u0027ve got to go to the gym a bit more. It\u0027s more of an understanding of the balance between what you\u0027ve got to eat and how it affects your body.  My stomach just shrank. I used to eat loads and still be picking on stuff after my tea but now I can eat much less than I used to. I used to eat anything - up to five bags of crisps a day. I absolutely loved crisps, sweets, it was just really unhealthy. I\u0027m not allergic to anything, I don\u0027t not eat any food - so I would literally eat anything that was there. I used to take food and hide it in my room so when I went to bed I would eat loads of crisps and chocolate. I used to stash food so I could eat it in private. I didn\u0027t find it hard to lose weight, particularly after I started seeing results. In that first month I lost so much weight I started thinking I could actually do it.A glam young teacher who lost a staggering NINE STONE after being bullied throughout high school has confessed she now has to knock back advances from the same lads who once tormented her. Elizabeth Jobson, 23, was mercilessly bullied throughout her childhood and describes her time at secondary school as \u0027absolutely awful\u0027.

Richard Cox helped his wife Hayley give birth to early arrival Emilie, crediting staff from the Scottish Ambulance Service with saving her life. An ambulance call handler told him to find shoelaces or string to tie off the cord to stop the bleeding and prevent potentially deadly infection. But the 31-year-old bank worker said all he had to hand were his headphones.  He said: It all happened so quickly - my wife went into labour late at night and before I had time to dial for an ambulance she\u0027d been born. After Emilie arrived, I rang 999 and the call-handler said I needed to find a bit of string - such as a shoelace - to tie up the umbilical cord. The only thing I could find was my iPhone earphones - I tied them to the cord and it was fine. Mr Cox praised the ambulance service for saving his baby daughter\u0027s life. He said: The call-taker deserves all the credit. While this happened, she was asking is the baby breathing, is the baby okay? With all the noise in the background, she could have lost her cool as well. We had it in our mind that the child was not going to be breathing. All the actions of the Scottis Ambulance Service ensured that our little girl survived and I can never thank them enough. The drama started when Mr Cox\u0027s wife Hayley, 32, started having intense pains in early January, although their daughter was not due until February 27.  She was in the bathroom at the couple\u0027s home in Rosyth, Fife, when she called out for her husband. Mr Cox said: She said \u0027Can you come to the bathroom?\u0027 Within a few minutes, I had our baby in my hands. My wife then said \u0027You need to phone 999\u0027. He added: It happened too fast, I could not grab the phone to call 999. At the hospital, I was saying I cannot believe this. I cannot remember if she was head first or what. The main priority was making sure she was breathing, and making sure her face was wiped. I did not appreciate she was born until the ambulance arrived. It\u0027s amazing how your instinct takes over.

Westwood, 60, was pictured with masked members of Moscow17, a rap group accused of glamorising gun violence through their gritty lyrics and taunting music videos. Two of Moscow17\u0027s members have died at the hands of rival gangs since the image was posted to Westwood\u0027s Twitter account in April 2017. Police said 23-year-old Sidique Kamara, who used the stage name Incognito, was killed in a horrific triple stabbing in Camberwell on Thursday evening.  Kamara was fatally stabbed near the spot where his friend and bandmate Rhyhiem Ainsworth Barton, 17, was gunned down on the same street just weeks ago. The pair appeared with former Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood on his YouTube channel in April last year, but it appears the crib session footage has since been deleted. Earlier this year, Sidique and another member of Moscow 17 were cleared at the Old Bailey of murdering teenager Abdirahman Mohamed, a brother of a member of rival gang Zone 2 from Peckham.  Just over 24 hours before he was killed, Sidique, who friends say had a six-year-old daughter, appeared to reference violence in the south London neighbourhood in a Twitter post. He tweeted: My Part Of My Hood Is Tragic Right Now ... I Walk With Allah Daily I’m Blessed. He had recently admitted that the drill rap genre was contributing to violence in London, but challenged politicians to do more to help youth in deprived neighbourhoods. politan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has blamed social media for fuelling a surge in murders in London, singling out the drill genre of rap music for glamourising violent crime and calling on YouTube to take down the videos.

The study of 4,000 Brits shows those exposed to vehicle exhaust fumes have changes in the structure of the heart similar to those seen in the early stages of heart failure. Researchers from Oxford University and Queen Mary University of London looked at the development of the larger right and left ventricles which are the main pumping chambers. The British Heart Foundation-funded study found a clear link between those who lived near loud, busy roads, and were exposed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or PM2.5 - the small particles of air pollution that can be absorbed deep in to the lungs. Dr Nay Aung of Queen Mary University,said: “Although our study was observational and hasn’t yet shown a causal link, we saw significant changes in the heart, even at relatively low levels of air pollution exposure.  “Air pollution should be seen as a modifiable risk factor. “Doctors and the general public all need to be aware of the their exposure when they think about their heart health, just like they think about their blood pressure, their cholesterol and their weight.” Participants in the UK Biobank study provided information on their lifestyles, health record and where they have lived. They also had blood tests and MRI scans to measure the size, weight and function of their hearts. Higher exposures to the pollutants were linked to more significant changes in the structure of the heart. For every one extra microgram per cubic metre of PM2.5 and for every 10 extra micrograms per cubic metre of NO2, the heart enlarges by 1% . Participants had no symptoms but similar heart remodelling is seen in the early stages of heart failure.

Colette Tomassi owed more than \u0026pound3,000 in rent to Hull City Council when she was removed from the property on July 10. The 38-year-old single parent was also allegedly booted out because of her behaviour, which the council said had had a “detrimental” effect on the neighbourhood.  After turning down emergency accommodation, Ms Tomassi and her children moved in with a friend in Bransholme and was able to rent two garages in Sheldon Close for \u0026pound18 a week to store her possessions and furniture, reports Hull Live .  However, she can no longer afford the fee and on August 8, she will have nowhere to store her belongings and she fears her family may soon be forced to wander the streets.  She said: “We are at a friend’s flat at the moment but I feel like I am outstaying my welcome and it is putting pressure on his relationship. “We are classed as homeless and I am devastated because I’m 38 and I’ve never been in this situation before. On Tuesday night we all went to sit in the garage at 10.30pm and my little one started crying. “He said ‘I’m not staying here anymore’ and he was crying his heart out. He ran back to the flat and wouldn’t stop crying. It was heartbreaking. “It’s awful to see my children like that and it’s stressing me out because I can’t do anything. We are all crammed into a living room with two on a double mattress, one on the settee and one on the chair with a pouffe.” Ms Tomassi had lived at the house in Porlock Drive for three years but said neighbours often complained about her son’s volatile behaviour which makes it difficult for him to control his anger.  She also suffered a huge health setback after being struck down with a heart attack in December 2016 and diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia – a condition which causes the arteries to narrow. After the heart attack, Ms Tomassi began struggling to pay her rent and due to health problems, she found it difficult to get her children to school on time. She developed anxiety and depression and claims her benefits were stopped with her now only receiving \u0026pound150 a fortnight in child tax credits.  She has appealed the eviction but to no avail and she thinks the council has not supported her enough during her current financial dilemma. Ms Tomassi said: “I just feel like the council haven’t given us a chance. I’ve tried to get the benefits back and I am doing my best but I’m not a miracle worker. “My Jobseeker’s Allowance stopped because I had no address and I need to reapply. Meals are hard to come by and the money I am on isn’t enough. “They want \u0026pound18 for these garages which I can’t afford to pay for and I’ve already paid \u0026pound300 back in rent. “Those garages are like a sauna and it’s not nice having to rifle through black bin bags for our belongings.

And Lucy was traumatised when one of her exes told her he could never be attracted to her because of her skin. However, the Art History and Latin at the University of St Andrews has recently started modelling on the catwalk for lingerie brands. Lucy, originally from Santa Fei in New Mexico, USA, said: I never thought I\u0027d be doing underwear photoshoots. It\u0027s incredible, the comments I have received so far, they have been amazing. Starting to think that someone like me can be associated with beauty can change future women\u0027s perceptions of scarring, similar conditions and more. One of my exes told me he could \u0027never be attracted to me\u0027 because of my skin, it was very insensitive.  The teen, now living in Fife, east Scotland, added: I\u0027m used to comments where people have told me I looked diseased and things like that, so I was trying to change people\u0027s perceptions. So when I was asked to do a lingerie shoot, I did think back to his comment that I could \u0027never be attractive.\u0027 It\u0027s a nice feeling and seeing how I\u0027ve worked on my own body and I love myself enough to put my body out there like that. The catwalk was so empowering, I walked down the first one bare-foot, which I\u0027ve never done in public due to being too self-conscious of my scarring. Lucy often needs bandages to protect her skin as anything from a fall to opening a jar to brushing her teeth can cause open wounds. RDEB even affects Lucy\u0027s eating, as food grazes can appear on her throat. She said: I have had really positive, uplifting comments all the way to the extremely judgemental and callous remarks, as you can imagine.

A landmark study showed insulin-producing cells can be “rebooted” in many cases if weight loss is achieved before the cells have been killed off completely. Previous findings from the DiRECT study released last year showed almost half of sufferers could be cured by a strict diet of nutritional shakes and soups. Foods are then slowly introduced alongside counselling to how to live healthily. If rolled out nationally the scheme could cure at least 1.5 million of the 3.6 million British patients diagnosed with diabetes saving the NHS an estimated \u0026pound4 billion a year. Researchers at Newcastle University measured levels of fat in the liver and pancreas in 41 of the original study participants. Of these 29 were successfully put in remission and 16 were not.  After losing weight the insulin-producing beta cells of people in remission started to work properly again, releasing the right amount of insulin the body needs. Their insulin production continued to improve over the study. There was no change in the amount of insulin being made by non-responders as their beta cells had not survived the stress of being surrounded by too much fat. Dr Elizabeth Robertson, research director at Diabetes UK which funds the trials, said: “DiRECT has already provided evidence to suggest that some people can put their Type 2 diabetes into remission, but we didn’t yet know why. “This latest study builds on these promising findings and helps us understand how weight loss can help some people to kick-start their insulin production again. “DiRECT has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people. “We’re still waiting for all of the evidence, so it’s very important that anyone with Type 2 diabetes considering a low-calorie diet speaks to their diabetes healthcare professional first.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast hot weather","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Hot weather blast to hit parts of UK with temperatures topping 31C in LondonThe Met Office said temperatures are likely to hit at least 32C and possibly 33C in parts of the south east today - and it\u0027s likely to continue into next weekShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByPress Association06:00, 3 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Parts of the UK will be basking in another blast of hot weather today.  The mercury is likely to reach the high 20s and lows 30s, with Met Office meteorolgist Alex Burkill saying: It is not the end of the hot weather for the summer. Temperatures could climb back up to a sweltering 31C in London this weekend, with sunshine returning to most of the country. The north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland will enjoy temperatures in the mid-20s, with scatterings of rain.  Essentially at the end of the week we\u0027re looking at a bit of a north-west/south-east split in the weather, a Met Office spokesman said. Northern and some western areas will often be cooler with some outbreaks of rain - particularly in Northern Ireland - and that could spread in to southern and western Scotland. Temperatures are likely to hit at least 32C and possibly 33C in parts of the south east on Friday, while south western parts of the UK could see 28C or 29C.  The spokesman added: This weekend is much more promising than last weekend with plenty of sunshine around, although the north of England could see a few showers on Saturday. The heat is likely to continue into next week. Temperatures will remain pretty hot across at least the south of England but potentially more widely across the UK - we could see some wet weather coming across the north west, but still pretty hot, the spokesman said.  Holidaymakers heading to Spain and Portugal were warned of an extreme heatwave which could see the hottest temperatures ever recorded in continental Europe. Luke Miall, a Met Office meteorologist, said the current record of 48C (118F) in Athens, Greece, in 1977 could be broken as a wave of blisteringly hot air sweeps in from Africa. Temperatures crept into the low 40s on Wednesday and are predicted to rise and peak at the weekend, with the highs expected inland rather than in coastal areas. He added: These sorts of temperatures are not only exceptional for the locals but people from the UK will never really have experienced them.   Especially with it being the school holidays , and the very young and old being susceptible to heatstroke, we\u0027re advising tourists to keep out of the midday sun and protect themselves.  Combined with high pressure in charge, blue skies every day, and the ground already warmed up, that leads to a day-on-day build, combining to give us these intense temperatures. Temperatures in south-west France could also rise to the high 30s, he added.

Despite the fact that no one really wants to admit their package doesn\u0027t fill out a condom, UK-based company, They Fit say it\u0027s a problem faced by millions of men. Their research has shown that an increasing number of men are searching for smaller sized condoms every day. And now they may finally have a solution, as they have started selling the world\u0027s smallest condom.  A regular condom measures around 7.1 inches but this new, more inclusive, range of condoms are almost half the size.  They Fit have produced condoms which start at just 3.1 inches, with a width of 2.6cm and a nominal width of 4.1cm.  Wondering if the new condoms could be the right fit for you? The company\u0027s website poses several questions that may help you find out. Do you find that condoms are much too long for you? they ask.  Do they slip or fall off entirely during use? How about when you try supposedly small condoms that are labelled things like \u0027Snug\u0027, \u0027Iron Grip\u0027 or \u0027Close Fit\u0027? Do the problems remain? It\u0027s because such condoms aren\u0027t actually that much smaller.  The website features a series of graphics which highlight the lack of difference between a regular condom and smaller ones previously sold to the public.  Traditional small condoms, including those labelled \u0027Close Fit\u0027, \u0027Snug\u0027 and \u0027Iron Grip\u0027 aren\u0027t actually that different in size from regular condoms, they explain.  In fact all of these supposedly small condoms are still at least 7 inches long. They add that finding out a condom doesn\u0027t meet your size requirements is a very common problem. Indeed millions of men every single day are searching the internet for small condoms and a real solution to their problem. But it\u0027s not so much that you need a small condom - it\u0027s that traditional condoms are much too big for most men!

The iPhone maker\u0027s hit the figure today, making the company the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach the record valuation. Apple\u0027s market capitalisation was just under 950 billion US dollars on Tuesday, meaning it needed stock prices to rise around 7% to pass the trillion-dollar mark. Though it is rare for Apple shares to climb that much in a single day, it is not unprecedented - in July 2016 stock rose 6.5% in a day after financial results beat analysts\u0027 expectations. However, several other technology firms have seen their share price drop in the wake of recent financial results - most notably Twitter and Facebook last week after both reported slowing user growth.  GBH Insights analyst Dan Ives told CNBC after the historic market move: I think it just speaks to just how powerful the Apple ecosystem has become over the last few decades. This is not the end, that they hit $1 trillion. I view this as just kind of speaking to a new a stage of growth and profitability.  A key area for Apple in its results was iPhone sales - the company\u0027s flagship device. Analysts predicted iPhone sales to be up slightly on last year. But revenue rising further thanks to the higher price of the iPhone X , which Apple said, when announcing its last set of results, was its best-selling phone.

But even though we might not have to check our shoes for funnel webs and red backs, that doesn\u0027t mean we want to welcome those hairy, beady-eyed creepy crawlies into our homes. Summer is just not the ideal time if you\u0027re an arachnophobe. Although spiders don\u0027t necessarily prefer our houses to the outdoors, the heat draws them inside as they seek cooler climes - and us keeping our windows and doors ajar to stay cool seems like an open invite. Fortunately, there\u0027s an unlikely ingredient spiders despise that you can use to keep them away.  Apparently a simple essential oil completely puts them off coming inside our houses that doesn\u0027t involve any poison.  Goodtoknow says that peppermint oil is like a repellent for spiders - they absolutely hate it and will avoid at all costs.  All you need to do is grab a spray bottle, put a few drops of peppermint oil in and spray liberally around the house, particularly at potential entry points. It\u0027ll be trial and error at first but apparently should keep them at bay, make sure you dust and vacuum away any cobwebs they may be hiding in first.  Another tactic you can try is to avoid certain colours that attract the creepy crawlies. Scientists used to think that spiders don\u0027t see colour - but according to a new study it turns out that they do and their fave colour is green.

In particular, the seaside resort of Benidorm on Spain\u0027s east coast, has proved to be a popular destination for sunseekers. The hot spot, which has reached highs of 33C (91.4F) today, is a favourite for many families who seek value-for-money holidays. However many tourists may have got more than what they bargained for as scenes from the beach show it to be crammed full of holidaymakers.

Hundreds of colourful parasols are pushed closely together along the coast, while sun seekers squeeze their way through throngs of fellow holidaymakeholidrs.

And with the government unwilling to relent on their position of pro-gun ownership, parents have started to come up with creative ways to protect their children. Following the Sandy Hook primary school shooting in 2012, one woman devised a particularly clever way to keep kids safe.  In a post on Facebook , Katie Cornelis from Southbury revealed how she had given her two young nieces a door stop to put in their backpack.   She wrote: After the Sandy Hook shooting, I gave both my nieces this little door stop to always keep in their backpacks. It truly pained me when I handed it to them, and I didn’t want to scare them, but it was out of love and they understood. She explained that in light of the most recent shooting in the US, she wanted to share her idea with all parents and anyone that could be affected by gun violence. Katie went on to admit that she carries a doorstop in her own purse every day.  Sure it’s small, but it can be powerful in keeping you safe if you ever have to barricade yourself in a room, she said. If a gunman shoots out the door lock it will still keep the door from opening and may just buy you some time. I’m really sad posting this but a security expert shared this tip with me so I wanted to pass it on. I pray no one ever has to use it.

The demise of the population is said to have been sparked from a massive drought that spread across Mexico. Researchers looking into the climate of the region found that rainfall fell around 70 per cent at the time they abandoned the ancient cities. There has been much debate around what happened to these city states but the theory that it was caused by drought has been around for years.  Others have suggested the cause of the collapse were either war, invasion or loss of trade routes. New research has come to light after a team of researchers managed to figure out the climate of the Yucatan Peninsula at the time by using sediment samples from a local lake. The role of climate change in the collapse of Classic Maya civilisation is somewhat controversial, partly because previous records are limited to qualitative reconstructions, for example whether conditions were wetter or drier, said Nick Evans, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge. Our study represents a substantial advance as it provides statistically robust estimates of rainfall and humidity levels during the Maya downfall. Classic Maya civilisation spans from 250 to 800 AD when the famous stone monuments were constructed.  At the end of this period, something happened to cause people to abandon the limestone cities.  Mr Evans and his team\u0027s new research has been published in the journal, Science, reports The Independent .  They expanded on the theory that drought was the cause of economic and political changes around 800 AD. The team analysed water trapped within crystal of a mineral called gysum, found in Lake Chichancanab.

I’ll train hard and see how I can improve myself here, that’s the best thing I can do.“The squad is good, everybody is competitive and ready to play.“You have to push each other in training and, hopefully, it’s going to be a good season.”The 24-year-old spent the last three seasons at English non-league side Kidderminster and, after missing out on promotion to the National League, felt it was time to test himself at a higher level.When Dundee came calling shortly after the season finished, there was only one answer from the Frenchman.“I really enjoyed my time at Kidderminster, I had a good few seasons,” he added.“We missed promotion last year but I felt this summer was time for me to move on.“Obviously, Dundee came for me and I thought going to the Scottish Premiership, playing against Celtic and Rangers, would be a good level for me.“I want to step up my level as well and play against better players to improve myself and test myself.“It was the right time for me to move on.“I’ve watched a few games especially the big ones like the Celtic-Rangers ones.“I don’t know everything about the Scottish league but I think it is a good level.”As an attacking midfielder, Ngwatala has impressed many already at Dens Park with his displays in the early-season games.He, though, says there’s more to come from him – and the rest of the team – once the campaign really gets under way over the next few weeks.Shortly after signing, Ngwatala was whisked off to Portugal with the rest of the squad for a pre-season training camp and he says the good work put in on the Algarve will stand the side in good stead this season.He added: “The preparations were hard in Portugal, the weather made it difficult, but we worked very hard so, hopefully, that will help in the season.“We worked on different things and you can see we still need to get to know each other but that will come.“Sometimes it’s good to go away together because the new people like me and the ones already here stay together and learn from each other. It was good.”With a few French speakers already in the squad, it’s been easy for Ngwatala to settle into life at the Dark Blues – and he’s hoping to enjoy some good days with the fans at Dens Park, too.“Everybody is cool, you can speak to everybody, there are no problems.“It helps a lot to have some French speakers but we try to speak English so everybody can understand.“I’ve been surprised at Dens because it was a great atmosphere.“Hopefully, there’s more of that to come.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b62ca7ee7e25-846x564.jpg ","title":"local boy riley 13 determined to walk by himself unaided","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA determined local teenager who was wheelchair-bound is learning to take his first steps unaided.Riley Murray, 13, a pupil at Montrose Academy, was born with cerebral palsy and received life-changing surgery in America in 2011.After seven years of hard work and constant physio, Riley was able to take his first shaky steps on his crutches.Since January, he has attended twice-weekly gym sessions at Mission Fitness Scotland in Brechin which have helped build his strength and his confidence.His sessions with trainer Jason Mowatt and the progress Riley has made have delighted his parents.His mum Trudy said: “Riley has been making amazing progress.“The gym is to hold a fundraiser to help us with our costs.

It’s going to affect the ecology of the river itself as well.”Fellow volunteer Michael Summers, 52, added: “The council developed this area and now they’re telling these people to rip it up again. It will be sad to see it go.”Ken Slater, 62, said: “It would be nice if anything could be done to divert it somewhere else and protect the wildlife.”The incinerator is being built by German firm MVV, replacing the DERL facility.Paul Carey, managing director of the new facility, sought to reassure the group that protecting both the local and wider ecology was at the heart of the project.“This has all been consulted on with Dundee City Council and groups such as Dighty Connect, and planning permission has been granted,” he said.“None of our work will be done during the nesting season and we will be planting trees to replace the ones we cut down to maintain the same number overall.

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united may be cautious but glass is highly rated at the club","story":"\t\t\t\t\tUntil victory at Elgin City on Saturday – however impressive, it was very much a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted – there is no escaping the fact Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign fell way below expectation.A draw and penalty shootout loss against Arbroath followed by defeat at Ross County, though the performance was decent, meant it was effectively over by the mid-point of the group stage.Going into the home clash with Alloa a week past Saturday, mathematically United could have still qualified but, as the most they could have mustered was seven points, we all knew they were out.In the previous two seasons of the group format, no runners-up had progressed with such a low total and that was to be the case again this time round as Inverness missed out on goal difference despite chalking up three wins.That meant, in some ways, another draw, that was followed by more spot-kick woe against the Wasps, was irrelevant.Except for the fact United were looking for decent performances and results in the lead up to this weekend’s Championship opener against in-form Dunfermline.It meant improvement at Borough Briggs, if nothing else to raise morale among fans, was vital.For that reason the 4-0 success up north was a big result for United and manager Csaba Laszlo who, if not quite feeling pressure, had clearly been perturbed by his new-look team’s sticky start.Csaba’s spirits were lifted by the performance and it allowed him to highlight the contribution of a young player whose displays in the Betfred had been largely lost in the gloom surrounding the first three results.In mentioning teenager Declan Glass, though, the gaffer probably demonstrated his awareness of United’s long history of producing exciting young talent. Not only did he avoid going overboard about the 18-year-old, he went out of his way not to compare him with any of those who went before him.Csaba even stressed the kid, who got his first goal at Elgin, will be developed carefully.That’s a process he started last season when there were those who felt Glass should have been thrown into the team.His boss resisted that temptation and, while we can expect to see him feature regularly in matchday squads this term, he will be used carefully.“Declan is a player from our academy and he has skill. At the moment I want to build him up and slowly give him the chance to show how good a football player he is,” said Csaba.“He has to learn a lot, especially he likes to dribble, but he has to play for the team. On Saturday – and in the previous games – he has a really good shot from the second line. He sees the situation and I think he will be a very good football player.”Even with those cautious words, it’s clear how highly United rate this kid. However much they try to protect him, the more is seen of him, the more it’s likely comparisons with other homegrown talent will be made.Given his eye for a goal and the kind of pass in and around the penalty area that creates opportunities for others, the one recent product of the Tannadice youth policy he seems most likely to be compared with is Ryan Gauld.That would come with a degree of pressure and mean he has big shoes to fill but it could be useful in his development. Talent that he is, in four years since leaving for Lisbon, Gauld hasn’t made the progress expected.That can serve as a reminder to Glass, however eager he is to develop, following his manager’s policy of taking things a step at a time looks certain to be the best way forward.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/stipe.jpg ","title":"trialist

tp planning laws","story":"\u0026nbspA LEADING conservation charity has warned that Scotland\u0027 heritage is in danger of being ridden roughshod over with plans being submitted for four new developments close to Culloden Battlefield.The applications, which include a 13-lodge holiday and leisure centre, come in the wake of controversial plans being approved for 16 new homes at Viewhill Farm near to the battlefield.\u0026nbspThe National Trust for Scotland is now calling on the Scottish Government to overhaul the planning system.Simon Skinner, the charity\u0027 chief executive, said previously raised fears regarding the protection of Scotland\u0027 heritage were coming to pass.\"The specific development of the Viewhill Farm luxury houses at Culloden does not in itself fatally impinge on the battlefield but it sets a precedent from which other developers can argue for more portions of land to be given over to yet more housing,\" he said.The four new applications are all located in the conservation area. In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it. That can only be achieved by overhauling the current diffuse focus on individual planning applications in isolation.\"Now is the time to make that change. The forthcoming Planning (Scotland) Bill is the point of no return for Scotland\u0027 heritage. It could either prove to be the saviour of some of our most special places or the prelude to their irrecoverable loss.\"Friday 3 Aug 2018 7:34 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116840.jpg","title":"New team aims to make changes easier","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW team of health and social care professionals has been established to support disabled people transition from children to adult services.People aged between 14 and 25 were traditionally supported by Highland Council\u0027s children\u0027s services and NHS Highland\u0027s adult services.The new transitioning team will provide a consistent platform for young people, parents and carers at what can be a challenging time.Nicola Stewart, transitions team manager, said: \"The team has been set up in response to recognising that the transition period can be difficult for young people and their families and carers.\"There are a lot of changes in a young person\u0027s life during that period, such as leaving full-time education and starting employment, and we don\u0027t want the process of transitioning from one service to another to exacerbate that.\"The overarching vision for the team is to take young people living in the Inner Moray Firth area through the process of transition and to support them in a more consistent way than has been possible in the past.\"Transitions team manager Stella Chisholm said: \"The establishment of the team will provide the opportunity for the one service to support an individual from 14 years of age all the way through to 25.\"This is a fantastic example of joint working.

financial planner Jonathan Craig, 37, and midwife Joanne Macdonald, 26, in 2016 after they met at the Union Street branch.At the time Joanne was a barista there and served her future fiance while he was studying for his exams.Bosses at the branch have agreed to close the coffee shop in order for the Bucksburn couple to tie the knot on September 8.Jonathan said: “We knew we didn’t want to get married in a church – it’s just not something that really suits us.“Instead, we wanted somewhere with a real meaning to us.“We were looking to do something a bit different.“That’s how we came up with the idea of marrying in Starbucks.“It was my fiancee that first suggested it.“I was initially worried because it’s not the biggest of spaces so I wasn’t sure it would work – but we’re keeping it small and it’s worked out.“Starbucks were really open to the idea and seemed very enthusiastic. They’ve been brilliant – so helpful and really on side.”Jonathan said the branch played a special part in their burgeoning romance.He said: “I met Joanne when she was working there as a barista while she was studying midwifery at Robert Gordon University.“We began going out in April 2016.“I used to come into the Starbucks quite a lot as I was I studying for my professional exams.“To be honest, I was completely oblivious at first – it was my friend that said she liked me.“She would often come across on her break and we got chatting.“That’s really where it all started – the early days of our relationship were in that Starbucks.”Jonathan said friends and family have been slightly bemused by their choice of venue, although they have chosen a more traditional option for their reception – the Marcliffe at Pitfodels Hotel.“The place will be shut between noon and 3pm for the wedding and they’ll be putting up fairy lights and curtains to make it look a bit nicer and like a wedding,” he said.“It’s certainly an unusual choice of wedding venue – I haven’t heard of anything like it before. Disbelief is the most common reaction we get when we tell people where we’re getting married.“The hardest people to win over were our parents who are a bit more traditional.“It took a little bit of persuasion but they’ve come around now.”As the day gets closer, the couple are completing the finishing touches for their dream wedding.Jonathan said: “The nerves are definitely kicking in.“We’re really coming down to the nitty gritty – it’s all becoming very real. But we’re both so excited for the day.”Starbucks regional manager Cindy Ross said: “We are delighted to be hosting the ceremony for Jo and Jona-than.“Jo was a barista here and that’s where she met Jonathan so it was an important place for them.“When she approached us I was over the moon.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"playgroup is helping kids learn","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff from a north-east playgroup provide a nurturing environment for children to play and learn, inspectors have said.Monitors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Monymusk Playgroup at Jubilee Hall on June 20 and have now published their report.The group can look after up to 30 children aged two and three.Inspectors rated the group “good” for care and support – the third best of six possible ratings.“Monymusk Playgroup staff’s welcoming, sensitive and friendly interactions created a nurturing environment for children to play and learn,” said the report.It added: “Children were comfortable and confident in staff’s company and readily approached them for help and support.”One parent told inspectors: “I am extremely happy with my daughter’s playgroup.

He said: “This terrific path enabled my children and I to go on a 20km bike ride from our home in Kintore without having to pop the bikes on the car and drive to a safe cycle route.“Following its opening last Saturday and the planned next stage being Kintore to Blackburn, I am continuing my campaign for a route from Kemnay to Kintore and Inverurie.\u0026#8220Around 67% of the children who attend Kemnay Academy come from Blackburn and Kintore and are bussed there.“This route would allow them to access the school’s leisure facilities and clubs outwith school hours without parents having to taxi them.\u0026#8220I have asked council officers to look into this as the public transport links between our communities are poor and these paths not only benefit cyclists, they also provide a safe route for people to walk and jog.“The proposal has huge support within the local communities.”Mr Reid added: “This idea has been in my head since before I became a councillor.“One of my sons goes to Kemnay Academy and the bus services in that area are not very good, so it gives them limited options for using school services outside of school hours.“It makes sense to link up different Garioch communities and have a more comprehensive network rather than just focusing on the Inverurie to Aberdeen route.”Fellow East Garioch councillor Martin Ford has campaigned for a number of years for the cycle path between Kintore and Inverurie and has said he is pleased to see the route in use.Mr Ford, co-leader of Aberdeenshire Council’s Democratic Independent and Green Group, said: “The works to build the previously missing section of cycle path between Kintore and Port Elphinstone are now largely complete – including the actual path itself.\u0026#8220So the path is entirely useable all the way from Kintore to Port Elphinstone – and is being used, which is good to see.“A complete route for cyclists and pedestrians between Kintore and Port Elphinstone, without the need to cross the busy A96 dual carriageway, is obviously a big improvement.“I am very pleased Aberdeenshire Council has been able to provide this facility.”An Aberdeenshire Council spokeswoman said: “The creation of a shared-use walking and cycling path between Inverurie and Kintore is part of a larger project to develop a dedicated, traffic-free route between Inverurie and Aberdeen via Kintore and Blackburn.“In addition to this long distance route, Aberdeenshire Council is committed to improving walking and cycling infrastructure on a local level through the Integrated Travel Town projects.\u0026#8220The creation of a shared use walking and cycling path between Kintore and Kemnay is something the Council is willing to discuss with communities with a view to potentially developing in the future.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"viewers face switch off for signal upgrade work as upgrade work","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTV viewers in the north-east are facing an overnight switch-off as the

Aberdeen’s Tom Brian was just 28secs behind in second position with his clubmate Ben Ward a further 31secs behind in third.Fourth-placed Tom Roche (Insch Trail Running Club) was first Over-40 in 57:18.Kelly added: “There were four of us together for the opening two miles, then Tom Brian and myself pulled clear of the others.“We were shoulder to shoulder all the way to the top of the hill at five miles, but once we entered the off-road technical section of the course I was able to open up a bit of a lead.“When we got back on to the road for the final couple of miles I just pushed it on and managed to get the win.“I’d have to say this is probably my best performance given how hard I had to work and because I got the win over some good opponents.”Kelly believes this result will give him the confidence to go in search of more fast times in the months ahead.He said: “I have a couple of half marathons lined up and I’ll be aiming to improve on my best time of 1:15:55 set at Stirling in April.“I’m doing Nairn next month and possibly the Great Scottish Run at Glasgow in October.“I’ll be aiming to run under 1:15:00 which I think I am capable of doing based on my result at Ballater.“The Glasgow race in particular will have a high quality field so that will hopefully help push me along.“I am also thinking about doing the Leeds Abbey Dash 10km later in the year as it’s a fast course and a stacked field.“I’d also like to do some 3km and 5km races to keep my speed up and hopefully I can gain a few more podium positions.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class. Alan \u0026#8216Goldie\u0026#8217 Ross decided not to enter this year as he is selling his Citroen Saxo rally car and instead enjoyed the rally from the spectating areas.The overall winners of the 2018 Mach 1 stages were Bruce Edwards and Jim Smith in the Darrian follwed by Gordon Morrison and Calum Macpherson in their Subaru Impreza and third place went to Ian Paterson and Callum Shanks also in a Subaru Impreza.All the local drivers appreciate the efforts of Davie Hatrick and the team behind the scenes of DCC, who put so much time and effort to bring this fantastic rally to Argyll each year.The rally is always on the lookout for new volunteers to marshal at the event, this is a great opportunity for locals to get up close to the action and learn more about the sport.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"talented mojo line up announced","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/07/18, 11:51 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe 2018 MOJO line-up has been announced.Organisers met recently to choose all the acts \u0026#8211 and it was not an easy decision,  following a large response that highlighted so much talent.And due to the fantastic response, the line-up this year is bigger than before, including one act from last year with hot new material.Some of the musicians who did not make it onto the line-up can be heard between acts, with organisers playing their demo tracks between bands.The acts making the final line-up for Craignish Village Hall, Ardfern on Saturday October 20 are:\u0026#8211 Liam Sommerville\u0026#8211 Stephen Skinn\u0026#8211 The Brambelles\u0026#8211 Citizen 9\u0026#8211 The Hollow Mountain String Band\u0026#8211 4 BelowFull details of the MOJO event will be coming soon and tickets will be available from September 1.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll authors sweep the shelves","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 29/07/18, 12:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTwo authors based in Argyll have released new books.Sue Douglas of Taynuilt and Jennifer Campbell from Lochgilphead have shared their talents with the world, with the release of a book each this week.Career author Sue Douglas’ contemporary romance \u0026#8216If You Can’t Trust the Living\u0026#8217 and novice Jennifer Campbell’s children\u0026#8217s story \u0026#8216Edwin the Wee Elf\u0026#8217 are available online and in good bookshops.To escape unwarranted and adverse media attention, Robin Tyler rents a house in Cushlow Close, a family-owned development of four properties in a remote location.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

five thousand visitors descending on Inveraray Castle for the festival, the six businesses have a fantastic opportunity to raise their profile and sell their products.Now in its fifth year, the Business Gateway Argyll and Bute competition asked business owners to share with the panel of judges why their venture is special and why their products would be a good fit for the festival.The successful businesses who will showcase their products in the Business Gateway sponsored craft tent this year are Keltic Faerie, Janice Bracey Designs, Slate Island Seaweed, Alison McIntosh Prentice, Daisy Rocks Design and Cardross Crab Art.Alison McIntosh Prentice, based in Helensburgh, is an artist who cites the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret as her biggest influence.Using her worldwide travels as inspiration for her art, Alison has a background in graphic and multimedia design but through the years painted as a hobby.Mainly self-taught, Alison now focuses on her art full-time and has exhibited in Barcelona, Wales and Glasgow.Using colours and textures she admired while travelling, Alison’s paintings will be on display and available to buy at a stand within the craft tent at the Best of the West festival.Alison said: \u0026#8216I’ve been attracted to the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret for over 30 years and have further investigated the techniques they used in Gesso artworks which now make up the majority of my work.\u0026#8216The stand at the Best of the West festival will allow me to showcase my art and hopefully sell to those attending.\u0026#8216It’s particularly good timing as I’ve put my travel adventures behind me for now and I’m focusing on being in Scotland and producing the best artwork I can.\u0026#8217The judges included festival host, the Duchess of Argyll, Fergus Murray, Argyll and Bute council’s head of economic development and strategic transportation and councillor Bobby Good,

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

We’ll never know – but hopefully our newspaper will survive to provide some information. For an Ayrshire Post is among items going into a new time capsule at the top of the Burns Monument at Alloway. Also included in the stainless steel capsule is a Clydesdale Bank \u0026pound10 note, with a picture of Burns on it. Poignantly, there’s also a drawing of Robert Burns by National Trust for Scotland volunteer Isla Grant, 17. And there’s a letter by NTS trainee Parris Joyce on what The Bard means to her. Hopefully, the monument will survive well into the future as a result of a near \u0026pound500,000 restoration.  The old capsule turned up when workers removed the gilded urn that sits atop the monument. The urn is being regilded, and a new airtight-sealed time capsule will take the place of the old one. NTS staff suspected there might be an old capsule there.  That’s because of an old letter from a Thomas Hamilton to a John Connel (building contractor) on April 23, 1823. The letter mentions enclosing a hermetically-sealed glass bottle soldered into the tripod, and containing various items. As it happens, the Burns enthusiasts of the time chose a copper container, as the one that came out of the urn was covered in verdigris. Items inside included two Ayr newspapers of the day – an Ayr Advertiser and a West Country Journal – dating from 1816 and 1815 respectively. Although now in a poor state, these appear to have been chosen for stories they carried about proposals for a Burns Monument. The original capsule also contained a silver sixpence depicting George III. Spookily, the urn containing that capsule was erected following a parade to the then new monument on July 4, 1823. And the old capsule saw the light of day again, on July 4 this year.  The monument was built by public subscription and fundraising, and the restoration is also being funded  by donations.

The Honest Men kick off their Championship campaign at home to Partick Thistle on Saturday - the side they put to the sword last week to top their Betfred Cup group. And McCall, who is unfurling a title flag for the first time as a manager, hopes the fans can turn out for the occasion. He said: “We are all very much looking forward to the game on Saturday, where we will get the flag. “I am hoping for at least 3000 of our own fans there to make a hell of an atmosphere. “I think all the fans who missed the last game of the season will maybe want to come to this one. “Plenty would have thought we had blown the league, and they weren’t alone in thinking that - I thought we had blown it. “But we want to get off to a flyer and the fans can help.”  United will play Dundee at Dens Park in the last 16 of the Betfred League Cup on Saturday, August 18. For the second year in a row the Honest Men have topped the group with maximum points and still ended up with tough Premiership opposition away from home. McCall said: “The team that we beat in the group gets Celtic at home and we get Dundee away. “It’s just the luck of the draw. “But the way we are playing we will go up there and give it a go. McCall added: “We won the group convincingly, which was positive going into the new season.  “People seem to forget that it’s the second biggest cup in Scotland. “For a club like us to be a seeded team two years in a row is just exceptional. “I think our fans have bought into it too, as there was over 700 fans there at Firhill which was amazing.” Lawrence Shankland scored a stunning 35 yard lob to make it 37 goals from 37 games. McCall said: “He is very happy here so I think it would take a hell of an offer for him to leave.” Ross Docherty, who was on the bench against Partick, is expected to be in the squad on Saturay. Mark Kerr will be suspended due to bookings from last season carrying over. Chris Higgins is still sidelined, and Craig Moore and Andy Geggan will be assessed closer to game time.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"electrical raiders short circuit ayr","story":"NewsElectrical raiders short-circuit in AyrThieves forced to pull plug on sneak raid at CurrysPCWorldShare\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:09, 1 AUG 2018Updated13:29, 1 AUG 2018NewsSecurity was breached at the temporary fence on the right (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSneaky thieves used an empty shop to try to reach a lucrative haul of household appliances. They easily got into the half-open unit — then smashed their way into the Currys PC World store right next door. But the hundreds of thousands of pounds of electrical stock inside remained intact. The daring thieves smashed down a fire door to get into the stockroom — but all the expensive items were locked inside metal cages. And they did not get access to the showroom at the front. Store staff called in police at opening time on Saturday after discovering the mess they made. One source said: “This was an audacious attempt to clean the place out of valuable goods including computers, TVs and kitchen goods. “But they got absolutely nothing.” The raid happened in the early hours of Sunday, with the raiders exploiting the empty store next door. It used to be part of the electrical and computing chain, but is being turned into the 24-hour, no-frills PureGym. But access is simply over a seven foot high metal fence. The source added: “There were no extra security measures and no alarms, it was easy to get in and most of the entrance was open to the four winds. “The gang used hammers and cutting gear to batter down a fire exit door. They made a right mess but staff are glad they didn’t penetrate the sales floor.” Police forensic teams remained at the site most of Saturday and a security guard has now been put in place until it is properly secured. Ayr police confirmed the break- in and a spokesman said: “As yet there are no suspects and nothing has been stolen. We will be looking at CCTV and the incident is currently being investigated.” Currys PC World said: “We can confirm there has been no stock loss and the investigation into this incident is continuing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsPC and Mac"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland. But one staff member said: “This is the third time this month they’ve forgotten to order in the 10p bags - it’s unbelievable. And it had to happen on what seems like one of the busiest days of the year. “There are other Morrisons in Troon and Kilmarnock, you would think they could get an emergency supply from them, but apparently not.” The bustling store in the town’s Castlehill Road stopped selling 5p bags in a bid to go green and re-use the stronger 10p bags.

Dalmilling Golf Club in Ayr is now planning to honour Glenn Wilson’s awesome achievement. He scored just 61 ... a Tiger-beating eight under par. That equalled Sean Ryan’s round seven years ago and Glenn said: “I thought I was playing well, but not this well. “I love golf and cannot get enough of it.” He bagged an ace during the July Saturday Bowl at the lucky-for-him 13th. Yet at the second hole he scored a potentially card-wrecking double bogey 6. Glenn said: “My drive at the second landed in a divot and I ended up catching it thin and going into the bushes at the back.” He got hooked on golf six years ago when he picked up an old club and started hitting balls in the field near his home in Dalmilling. Three years ago he joined Dalmilling as a member and has played most days since then. His handicap has gradually gone down from 19 to the present six. That meant his score in the July Bowl was a net 55, blowing any opposition out of the water. His inward nine was just 28 strikes. Club secretary Tommy Swan says everyone is very proud of their “superstar.” He added: “This is an outstanding achievement, a magnificent score for a 15-year-old. “I’d say it was even more special because he double-bogied the second hole. “That would have wrecked most players, but Glenn stuck at it. “He started out at Dalmilling with only a few clubs, but has gradually built a set. And he is so keen on the game that he also volunteers to help the green-keeping staff on a regular basis. “We are planning something in his honour.” Glenn, of Thorneyflat Street, is in his fourth year at Ayr Academy and is cheered on by his three sisters and one brother. Parents Linda and Glenn are suitably proud of their starlet.  He is keen to make golf  his living and already represents his club in Ayrshire Golf Association competitions.  The next step would be to try for the Ayrshire Boys team. At the moment he is volunteering with the greenkeeping staff as part of his Duke of Edinburgh bronze award. And he casually admits that the hole in one was not his first, but his THIRD.  Most golfers don’t get one in their entire playing days and Glenn said: “I play  every day and I love Dalmilling.   “This was my first hole  in one during a competition.  “But I have just had two others, both at the eighth at Dalmilling, with my pal Adam Cambers and my uncle John Strachan.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrGet into GolfAyr NewsEdinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-gearing-up-for-international-festival","story":"THE line-up has been announced for the Beyond Borders International Festival, which is returns to Innerleithen next month.\nFormer CIA operative Valerie Plame, historian William Dalrymple and authors Magnus Linklater, Richard Holloway and Stuart Kelly will be among the headliners at Traquair House on August 25 and 26.\nAnd Scotland\u0026rsquos bestselling female music artist Barbara Dickson will also be on hand to perform.\nThe festival will feature a host of local and international artists, writers, journalists, politicians, and diplomats for a weekend of panel debates and discussions, spoken word, music, exhibitions, film, walks, and bike rides.\nThe Main Tent Programme features sessions with the UN Special Envoys to Yemen and Somalia and head of office for the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stephanie Koury \u0026ndash exploring their work making peace in the world\u0026rsquos most volatile conflicts, with veteran BBC foreign correspondents Allan Little and Razia Iqbal interrogating headline speakers.\nMeanwhile The New York Times\u0026rsquo photo exhibition Hard Truths exposes the gripping reality of social and political upheavals from the ISIS-ravaged streets of Mosul and Iraq, to the vigilante-style war on drugs in Rodrigo Duterte\u0026rsquos Philippines.\nThe Walled Garden will host an arts and music programme, with music, spoken word, exhibitions, sustainable produce and workshops.\nCycle rides with authors Peter Walker, Will Manners, and Kate Rawles, and foraging walks will also take place around the grounds.\nBarbara Dickson will perform an enchanting series of songs from Scotland and beyond on the Saturday.\nAnd the festival will feature Lisa Kristine\u0026rsquos pioneering new exhibition Bound to Freedom, a call to action and a brutal expos\u0026eacute of modern slavery.\nRenowned composer Nigel Osborne will be joined by Syrian, Ossetian and Georgian musicians, and followed by San Ghanny, music for Palestine on Saturday and SOWhErTO Africa on Sunday.\nOther highlights include a talk by critically acclaimed author Maya Jasanoff, while Columbian lawyer and activist Oscar Guardiola-Rivera will discuss peacebuilding in Northern Ireland.\nAnd on the centenary of Muriel Spark\u0026rsquos birth, her friend Alan Taylor will be interviewed by veteran BBC journalist Geoffrey Baskerville.\nMeanwhile Yemeni photographer Thana Faroq will offer a workshop on the power of visual storytelling, with human rights activist and actor Pinar Aksu leading one the following afternoon entitled \u0026lsquothe theatre of the oppressed.\u0026rsquo The full Beyond Borders Scotland summer events programme and box office is available online at www.beyondbordersscotland\nTicket prices: Weekend pass \u0026pound49.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action.

Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.

He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

And he claimed his attempts to repair his stricken vessel were scuppered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), which denied him permission to move to nearby Cockenzie Harbour to carry out the work.  Mr Ramsay, who is from West Yorkshire, told the Courier: \"I think it is a disgrace that East Lothian has no contingency plan for shipwrecks despite being a fishing community.  \"I have been threatened and abused while staying at the beach at Prestonpans with my boat and when I managed to float it and asked for permission to move to Cockenzie Harbour I was refused by the MCA.  \"I\u0027ve lost everything, this was my home and I invested everything in it.

He believes the 45ft vessel was struck by a submarine or whale after it was lifted out of the water by an impact.  It suffered additional damage after striking rocks as it beached at the town.  He set up camp on the beach as he looked into repairing the vessel but, while he initially said he received support from the local community, he told the Courier it did not last.  He said: \"I\u0027ve been abused and threatened by locals for staying at the beach.  \"My camp has some furniture which was donated by locals when I first arrived but since then I have been confronted by others angry that I am there.  \"I think it is shameful how I have been treated by this fishing community after becoming shipwrecked on their beach.\"  Mr Ramsay began breaking up the vessel last week, burning timber on the beach."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8124595.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cctv-considered-to-combat-foresters-park-vandals","story":"  Enjoyleisure, which manages the park on behalf of East Lothian Council, has confirmed it is looking at the possibility of introducing CCTV across the facility.  The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training.

Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.

Scots who incurred expenses claimed, on average, \u0026pound994.77 in the last year, and the smallest amount they would claim for is \u0026pound8.43, according to new research.  At the top of the list of reasons of Brits who failed to file expenses included deeming the value \u0026ldquotoo low to be worth the hassle and losing receipts.  Half of those who incurred business costs were frustrated at having to pay for them using their own funds before being reimbursed by their company.  More than a third experienced cash flow issues while waiting for their expense claims to be reconciled, with almost one in ten even missing a payment on a personal credit card as a result.  Visiting in-laws, ironing and cleaning the house were all activities workers would rather do than submit their expenses, the team at Barclaycard found.

Now the channel has been reinstated by YouTube while the BBC said it will review its actions.  The channel of another prominent independence campaigner, Peter Curran, was also shut down after BBC copyright complaints.  YouTube operates a policy which means that if you get three copyright strikes it will shut down the channel.    Mr Campbell, had insisted that the the videos should not have been removed and argued that the BBC had not taken similar action with other political sites that used its material.  Now the BBC has said it would \u0026ldquonot be taking any further action against Wings Over Scotland while\u0026nbspit carries\u0026nbspout a review into how it deals with copyright claims over videos that have political content, particularly on social media.  YouTube has now allowed the channel to return, but without the videos at the centre of the row.  The\u0026nbsp BBC said it had asked YouTube to also allow the 13 videos to be reinstated to the Wings Over Scotland channel.  BBC Scotland\u0027s head of public policy, Ian Small, said the move came after discussions with \"colleagues in London and elsewhere in the BBC\".    Former First Minister Alex Salmond had criticised the BBC for \u0026ldquorotten conduct amid the crackdown.  He talked of \u0026ldquostrange goings on at the Corporation and wrote to director-general Baron Hall demanding answers \u0026ldquoI want Tony Hall \u0026ndash I want \u0026lsquoBaron Hall of Birkenhead\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash to tell me what on earth is going on,\" he said.    But the BBC revealed it has halted action against Mr Campbell.  In a statement, it said: \u0026ldquoAs we have said throughout, whenever we receive complaints about our material being posted or used without authorisation we look to take action to protect our copyright.      That\u0027s that official, then. pic.twitter/rzepQqsKDo  \u0026ldquoThis action is normally limited to asking for individual videos to be removed and the BBC did not ask or demand for these whole channels to be taken down \u0026ndash that was a decision for YouTube alone.  \u0026ldquoWe act irrespective of the political views of the infringing YouTube channels and have taken action against the use of our material by individuals or organisations from across the political spectrum.  \u0026ldquoHowever, we are aware of the significant debate around our approach to removing content, and will be carrying out a review of our practice in relation to \u0026lsquopolitical\u0026rsquo content to ensure it is appropriate for today\u0026rsquos social media environment.  \u0026ldquoWhile we carry out our review, the BBC will not be taking any further action in relation to the Wings Over Scotland videos, which we understand should be re-instated by YouTube.  \u0026ldquoWe note that the rest of the channel has already been restored by YouTube.  \u0026ldquoUntil the review is complete, we will also not be seeking the removal of similar content from accounts unless it is used in a substantially misleading manner or we need to act to protect our commercial or brand interests.  Mr Campbell, insisted the the videos should not have been removed and argued that the BBC had not taken similar action with other political sites that used its material.  He claimed Scottish Labour councillor Scott Arthur was allowed to keep his channel after marking contested BBC videos as \"private\" - which means nobody else can see them.  Mr Campbell says he was not given the opportunity to similarly \u0027lock down\u0027 his contested clips and save his channel.  But Mr Campbell has highlighted political channels hosted by the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Conservatives and UKIP among others which publicly display BBC content.    Mr Campbell has contested the removal of the videos with YouTube citing fair dealing for all of them, \"since all are just short extracts and all of them explicitly identify the original source\".  \"Fair dealing\" exemptions in copyright law, allow material to be used for the purposes of \"criticism, review and reporting current events\" but only allow a \"reasonable and necessary\" amount of someone else\u0027s work to be used.

The UK Government has indicated it intends to establish its own GI scheme after leaving the EU.  In an article published on Thursday, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the protection of geographical indications is one of the outstanding issues yet to be agreed.  The Scottish Government has once again called for the issue to be resolved.  Rural Affairs Secretary Fergus Ewing said: \"Maintaining our protected food names and other geographical indications following Brexit is vital - this is something that we have been calling for the UK Government to do for a long time.  \"The European Commission\u0027s chief negotiator recognises the significant contribution that these producers make to the wider economy.  \"We have been pressing UK Government to agree a need for a UK GI system post-Brexit from the outset and, while we welcome confirmation in their White Paper of the plans to do so, there remains a question over maintaining the existing protection currently enjoyed by our producers within the EU through the mutual recognition of our protected products.  \"It is extremely alarming that the EU says this has not yet been resolved and that the failure of the UK Government to reach agreement on this issue is being cited as one of the obstacles to reaching an overall withdrawal agreement.  \"The UK Government must make it clear it is not preparing to ditch vital geographical indications to facilitate a future trade deal with the US.

Bank Governor Mark Carney said the hike, only the second since the financial crash forced rates down to an historic emergency low, warned of further rises ahead.  He said \u0026ldquolimited and \u0026ldquogradual increases were required to bring inflation down to its 2 per cent target now that the UK economic growth appeared to be picking up again.  He said: \u0026ldquoRates can be expected to rise gradually. Policy needs to walk, not run.  The increase means a slight increase in returns for savers, but more costs for those in debt.  The majority of mortgage-holders, who have fixed rates, will not see a difference.  However the respected Fraser of Allander think tank at Strathclyde University said that, while the increase might suit the UK as a whole, it was not ideal for Scotland.  Institute director Professor Graeme Roy said: \u0026ldquoThe interest rate rise - to the highest rate since 2009 - marks an important milestone in the UK\u0026rsquos recovery from the financial crisis.  \u0026ldquoWhilst costs for Scottish households with variable interest rate mortgages will rise, the overall cost of borrowing remains low by historical standards.  \u0026ldquoHowever, with earnings growth remaining weak, the\u0026rsquos increase has the potential to weaken consumer spending and dampen growth.  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos growth over the last three years has lagged behind the UK, so whilst the Bank may judge that the UK economy is in sufficiently robust health to cope with a rate hike, a rate rise in Scotland may be more of a challenge.  The Scottish Fiscal Commission, which determines the spending envelope for the Scottish Government, has forecast Scotland\u0026rsquos GDP growth will stay below 1 per cent for five years.  The MPC baulked at a rate rise earlier this year after the economy dipped as a result of the extreme winter weather caused by the \u0026ldquobeast from the east.  But Mr Carney said growth had since \u0026ldquorebounded, and the Bank raised its UK economic outlook in 2019 from 1.7 to 1.8 per cent growth in GDP.  The raise is likely to be the last before Brexit in March 2019, when Mr Carney has said the increase could be reversed to cope with any economic shock.  Liz Cameron, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said the raise was \u0026ldquodisappointing given the lack of hard evidence about the economy and Brexit uncertainty.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe Bank of England must tread carefully when it comes to further changes in interest rates.  \u0026ldquoPay rises are only just managing to outpace inflation, so this increase is likely to do little to encourage consumer confidence among the millions of Britons with variable rate mortgages.  \u0026ldquoIt is also unlikely it will provide much benefit to savers, or any lasting boost to the pound, with currency markets much more concerned about further clarity in the Brexit negotiations.  The Institute of Directors said the Bank had \u0026ldquojumped the gun by raising the rate now.  It said: \u0026ldquoThe rise threatens to dampen consumer and business confidence at an already fragile time. \"Growth has remained subdued, and the recent partial rebound is the least that could be expected after the lack of progress in the year\u0027s first quarter.\"  Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"The decision to raise interest rates looks ill-judged against a backdrop of a sluggish economy. While a quarter-point rise may have a limited long-term financial impact on most businesses, it risks undermining confidence at a time of significant political and economic uncertainty.\"  SNP economy spokesperson Kirsty Blackman MP added: \u0026ldquoThe hike in interest rates will deliver a further blow to the living costs and standards of millions of families across the UK, who are already feeling the squeeze as prices rise too fast.  \u0026ldquoThat apprehension is not helped by the continued uncertainty and instability caused by the UK government\u0026rsquos chaotic approach to Brexit, and its reckless rhetoric of a no-deal outcome \u0026ndash which will harm the economy, hit jobs and impact on small and large businesses.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time the UK government acted in the interests of the country, rather than the Tory party, so that households, low earners and businesses are not put under further strain.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the rise was a blow to those struggling with debt.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Tories\u0026rsquo economic failure is making life difficult for families across the UK. They must change tack and end austerity once and for all.  John Macintosh, head of tax in for Deloitte in scotland, said: \u0026ldquoSub-trend growth and a cloudy outlook hardly make a compelling case for a higher UK rates. In six months\u0026rsquo time this decision will look either prescient or premature. Either way it is bold move.  David Alexander, managing director of the leading Scottish estate agents DJ Alexander, said: \u0026ldquoI believe that the increase will not have a detrimental impact on the Scottish property market, whose growth in several areas is out-pacing the rest of the UK. Many of our clients\u0026rsquo properties are continuing to achieve sales levels that are significantly over the asking price.

After the fall - and killing - of Gaddafi the seventy-something former development chief was eventually accused of skimming millions from public contracts.

Those properties, as reported back in 2016, included the Kenmore Hotel a stone\u0026rsquos throw from Taymouth Castle.  The managers of the hotel, sometimes described as Scotland\u0026rsquos oldest inn, however, dismissed that claim as \u0026ldquoludicrous.  Earlier this year the Sunday Times said Mr Dabaiba and his family owned flats in both Edinburgh and Glasgow. All such reports cite a document relating to the Dabaibas\u0026rsquo properties provided by Libyan prosecutors to their Scottish counterparts. Mr Dabaiba and his family are understood to deny any wrongdoing.  Now the Organized Crime and Corruption Project or OCCRP - in a major investigation of Mr Dabaiba\u0026rsquos offshore finances - have said the document also included Taymouth Castle.  There has been community speculation for some time that the castle, on a loop in the Tay, was linked to Kenmore Hotel.  The Courier last year revealed that the castle and its grounds had been sold to a company called Mount Two Limited based in a free economic zone of the United Arab Emirates.  The paper, which covers Perthshire, said the previous owners Meteor Asset Management had invested some \u0026pound23m in to plans to turn the castle in to a hotel and timeshare destination.  The Courier later linked both Mount Two Limited and a firm called Rebus carrying out the reconstruction work to an English based developer called Clynt Wellington.  The Courier in April said work had \u0026ldquoground to a halt after a tax probe in to Rebus and said investors backing the projects were in talks with the developer.  The Herald was unable to reach Mr Wellington for further clarification. The businessman has been involved with several different enterprises regenerating the castle. One, called Farnham Developments Limited was dissolved earlier this year after going in to liquidation. Another, The Sunday Herald, reported in 2012, had gone in to administration in 2009 leaving unpaid debts.  A firm called Taymouth Estates Limited was liquidated in Guernsey in 2015 owing Farnham Developments \u0026pound1.5m. Its only asset, Farnham liquidators said, was mortgaged land at Taymouth.  Mr Dabaiba - whose whereabouts and exact age are unknown - has had strong links to Scotland and the rest of the UK. A former mayor, he received what is described as a modest wage to run a government department responsible for billions of dollars in development and regeneration contracts. He was previously subject to an Interpol red notice after post-Gaddafi and bitterly divided Libya sought reckoning with the inner circle of the old regime.  The OCCRP late last month published a detailed investigation, based on leaked documents, accusing Mr Dabaiba of skimming 20 per cent from contracts.  It said the former official may have used 16 bank accounts and seven companies in Cyprus as part of a complex international offshore finance mechanism.  Libyans, OCCRP reported, turned to Cyprus and its then confidential banking system after the international sanctions composed after the Lockerbie bombing, the biggest crime in modern Scottish history."},{"url":null,"title":"women-lose-meat-appetite-in-face-of-young-animals","story":"  They are more responsive to lambs, piglets, calves or joeys than men and the phenomenon is due to their traditional role as care-givers.  But when shown pictures of grown animals the phenomenon wanes in women.  Women are, generally, less enthusiastic eaters of meat \u0026ndash which is historically linked to machismo.  Psychologist Dr Jared Piazza at Lancaster University said: \u0026ldquoWe found both men and women find baby, farmed, animals to be cute and vulnerable, and experience feelings of tenderness and warmth towards them.  But these feelings affect the genders differently, with men experiencing much less reduction in their appetite for meat as a result.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspHealthy diet still off the menu for most households  Dr Piazza added: \u0026ldquoFeeling tenderness towards a baby animal appears to be an oppositional force on appetite for meat for many people, especially women.  He said this could be because women are often caregivers, even in today\u0026rsquos society.  Dr Piazza said: \u0026ldquoOur findings may reflect women\u0026rsquos greater emotional attunement towards babies and,  by extension, their tendency to empathise more with baby animals.  \u0026ldquoAlso, meat is associated with masculinity and images of tough men who consume meat for muscle building protein, along with prehistoric ideas of the male as hunter.  \u0026ldquoWomen have a much more ambivalent attitude towards meat and their identity is not bound up with it in the same way."},{"url":null,"title":"michel-barnier-torpedoes-theresa-may-ahead-of-brexit-talks-with-macron","story":"  Michel Barnier\u0026rsquos intervention undermined the Prime Minister on the eve of today\u0026rsquos meeting with President Macron at Fort de Br\u0026eacutegan\u0026ccedilon, his state residence on the C\u0026ocircte d\u0026rsquoAzur.  In an article published in 20 newspapers across Europe, Mr Barnier said some of the UK\u0026rsquos proposals would undermine the single market and threaten the EU.  Mrs May is cutting short a holiday in Italy to visit the French president as part of wider cabinet effort to woo individual nations on the merits of the Chequers plan.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was in Austria earlier this week, warning a failure to agree a Brexit deal based on the plan would be a \u0026ldquohuge geo-strategic mistake.  Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was also in France yesterday promoting the scheme.  The UK proposal would see a \u0026ldquocommon rule book between the UK and the EU on goods and and agri-food, but greater freedom on services and migration.  Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos article reinforced the EU view that this was unacceptable \u0026ldquocherry picking.  Although his argument was familiar, his timing was seen as a pointed snub to the PM.  It also jarred with reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was ready to back a so-called \u0026ldquoblind Brexit, a vague fudge which would help Mrs May avoid a no-deal Brexit.  However, in better news for Mrs May, Mr Barnier also said the EU would be more flexible on the key issue of a backstop for trade and customs in Northern Ireland.  He wrote: \u0026ldquoLet\u0027s be frank: as the UK has decided to leave the Single Market, it can no longer be as close economically to the rest of the EU.  \u0026ldquoThe UK wants to leave our common regulatory area, where people, goods, services and capital move freely across national borders.  \u0026ldquoThese are the economic foundations on which the EU was built. And the European Council - the 27 Heads of State or government - as well as the European Parliament have often recalled that these economic foundations cannot be weakened.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThe UK knows well the benefits of the Single Market. It has contributed to shaping our rules over the last 45 years.  \u0026ldquoAnd yet, some UK proposals would undermine our Single Market which is one of the EU\u0027s biggest achievements.  \u0026ldquoThe UK wants to keep free movement of goods between us, but not of people and services. And it proposes to apply EU customs rules without being part of the EU\u0027s legal order.  \u0026ldquoThus, the UK wants to take back sovereignty and control of its own laws, which we respect, but it cannot ask the EU to lose control of its borders and laws.  He said the biggest risk caused by Brexit was in Ireland, with the need to avoid a hard border between north and south.  \u0026ldquoWhat the EU has proposed is that Northern Ireland remains in a common regulatory area for goods and customs with the rest of the EU. We are ready to improve the text of our proposal with the UK, he said.  It was reported that Environment Secretary Michael Gove privately discussed the UK being \u0026ldquoparked in the European Economic Area alongside Norway after Brexit to avoid a no-deal.  The Financial Times reported the Brexiter floated the option at a dinner of moderate Tory MPs and peers on June 25, before the Chequers plan was decided.  German reports said Mrs Merkel was considering a blind Brexit involving hazy declarations on intent rather than a formal treaty to help the Prime Minister.  Labour MP Chris Leslie of the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on the Brexit deal, said the EU should not offer Mrs May a face-saving way-out.  He said: \u0026ldquoA blind Brexit would take the UK to the same place as a no-deal Brexit, but without the clarity. The idea that the fundamental contradictions of the government\u0026rsquos Brexit policy can be more easily resolved after the UK has left the EU is simply ludicrous.  \u0026ldquoA blind Brexit is being talked about because some see it as a short-term face-saving deal for both the British government and the European Union, both of which are now terrified that concluding with a failure to agree a deal will result in a humiliating no-deal Brexit.  \u0026ldquoWith the EU27 governments and the EU commission wanting to spare Theresa May\u0026rsquos blushes, there is a risk we end up with a fake deal to save face."},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundells-election-campaign-financed-by-tory-dark-money-fund","story":"  The secretive Scottish Unionist Association Trust (SUAT) helped pay the salary of Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign managers at the last two general elections.  Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos campaign manager costs were \u0026pound3,488 in 2015 and \u0026pound2,400 in 2017, however his official candidate return did not mention the SUAT partly bankrolled the posts.  The SUAT, which has given the Tories \u0026pound319,000 since 2001 but does not publish accounts, is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission over its status as a donor.  It was only last month, after the SNP challenged Theresa May over the SUAT at Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, that the shadowy outfit first named its trustees.  The SNP last demanded full transparency from the Scottish Secretary on the issue.  The money trail from the SUAT to Mr Mundell emerged yesterday when the Electoral Commission published the accounts of hundreds of small party branches across the UK.  These included the Scottish Borders Conservative \u0026amp Unionist Association (SBCUA), which covers the Tweeddale part of Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale \u0026amp Tweeddale seat.  The accounts for 2017 said the SBCUA had a paid campaign manager overseeing a series of elections, including Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos general election fight.  \u0026ldquoThe Association is very grateful to the Scottish Unionist Association Trust for providing 50% of the funds for this crucial campaigning position throughout 2017, with the Association itself being responsible for the balance, it said.  However there is no public record of the SUAT donating directly to the SBCUA in 2017.  Other SBCUA accounts showed the SUAT also part-funded a campaign manager for Mr Mundell in 2014 and 2015 in the long build-up to the 2015 election.  The cost split was not given, but official election invoices listed the campaign manager costs as \u0026ldquo103 days @ 50% and \u0026ldquo38 days @ 50%.  The SUAT gave the SBCUA at least \u0026pound12,336 in 2014 and \u0026pound6,168 in 2015.  The SUAT and SBCUA also jointly funded a campaign manager for Tory MP John Lamont in Berwickshire, Roxburgh \u0026amp Selkirk in 2015 and 2017.  During the 2015 election, the chair and treasurer of the SBCUA was former Merrill Lynch consultant Robert Miller-Bakewell, the chair of the SUAT.  He was also deputy chair and deputy treasurer of the SBCUA at the 2017 election.  Mr Mundell has denied getting cash from the SUAT, but has not denied campaign help.  However he was cagey about the issue when quizzed on BBC Radio Scotland last month.  He said: \u0026ldquoI personally have not received cash because we go through a process of funding associations and I am confident that over the full period during which I have been involved in politics, all donations I have received from any source have been appropriately declared.  Asked him much money his campaign had received, he said: \u0026ldquoThat is a question that can be sourced from all the declarations.  SNP MSP George Adam said: \u0026ldquoThe Tory dark money scandal is a running embarrassment for the party, and they\u0027re doing themselves no favours in trying to hide from scrutiny.  \"David Mundell has repeatedly tried to deny his links to the Scottish Unionist Association Trust. Now it seems they helped bankroll his election campaign.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re talking about one of the most senior Tories in Scotland here. He should be open and honest over where this money came from.  \u0026ldquoTransparency over party finances is absolutely essential in any healthy democracy. The public have the right to know who helped put their politicians into office.\"  The Electoral Commission yesterday said it would not be investigating a \u0026lsquodark money\u0026rsquo row involving the DUP, a former Scottish Tory, and the EU referendum.  A BBC Northern Ireland TV programme alleged the DUP may have worked improperly alongside other pro-Brexit campaigners.  The DUP accepted \u0026pound435,000 from the Constitutional Research Council, chaired by former Scots Tory candidate Richard Cook, on the eve of the referendum, which was then spent on newspaper ads in the UK.  The Commission said it did not have grounds to open an investigation into the allegations.  However it also urged the UK government to bring forward legislation allowing it to disclose details of past donations to Northern Ireland parties, which are currently kept secret.  Mr Mundell is currently on a UK Government trip to New Zealand.  The Scottish Conservatives said all SUAT donations to the party and all election spending had been properly and fully reported to the Electoral Commission in line with the law.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe money donated from the SUAT comes from the proceeds of the sale of Scottish Conservative properties in Scotland in the 1960s.  \u0026ldquoSince then, the SUAT has used those funds to promote the interests of the party.  \"These publicly registered documents show that the SUAT has helped fund a campaign manager for the SBCUA in recent years, as it has supported other Associations across Scotland. In 2017, this amounted to 50 per cent of the cost of the campaign manager.\""},{"url":null,"title":"music-and-dance-spectacular-as-edinburgh-tattoo-begins","story":"  Colourful costumes and rousing tunes helped a more than 8,000-strong crowd forget the drizzle at Edinburgh Castle where a final rehearsal took place on Thursday night.

While the conservation charity said it could not reveal the exact number as part of efforts to protect the species, most of the newly-tagged birds are in Scotland, with a number of them the offspring of birds tagged in previous years by the project.  Hen harriers are one of the UK\u0026rsquos rarest birds with a\u0026nbsppopulation decline due to habitat disturbance and illegal killing, according to the RSPB.  The charity hopes that by tracking the movements of the threatened birds of prey, it builds up a clearer picture of where hen harriers go and where they are at risk.  Of the birds tagged in 2017, almost 40% are known to have died from natural causes, in line with low survival rates.  The charity said\u0026nbspthat over a quarter of last year\u0026rsquos chicks disappeared in suspicious circumstances, with transmissions from tags suddenly stopping around grouse moors.

Although President Donald Trump has publicly thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for fulfilling the promise he made at their June 12 Singapore summit to return American war remains, US officials cautioned that little was known about the remains and that they could not be quickly identified.  John E. Byrd, director of the Defence Department laboratory in Hawaii where the 55 cases arrived on Wednesday, cited several reasons for saying at least some of the remains appear to be those of Americans missing from the Korean War.  Mr Byrd was present when North Korean officials turned over the 55 boxes at Wonsan airport in North Korea last Friday, and he was among the US government specialists who made a further preliminary examination of the contents after the boxes were flown to Osan air base in South Korea the same day.  A cursory examination at Wonsan confirmed the remains were human, he said, and a closer look at Osan gave reason to believe they likely are Americans.  Mr Byrd, speaking by video teleconference from Hawaii, said: \u0026ldquoWhat we saw were remains that were consistent with what we have found from the Korean War recoveries that we\u0026rsquove done over the years, and we found remains that were consistent with being Americans.  \u0026ldquoWe have remains that look to have been in a state of preservation consistent with coming from the Korean War era, adding that materials provided with the remains included US-issued military equipment such as canteens and buttons.  He said the remains are \u0026ldquogood candidates to be missing Americans from the Korean War where thousands died on battlefields and in prisoner-of-war camps during the 1950-53 conflict and remain officially unaccounted for.  Mr Byrd said he would not venture a guess at how many individuals are represented by the bones contained in the 55 boxes.  The US and North Korean militaries conducted joint excavations of war remains in the North between 1996 and 2005, yielding more than 200 set of remains \u0026ndash not all of which have been positively identified.  Separately, North Korea had handed over 208 boxes of remains between 1990 and 1994, some of which have also yet to be identified.  When the North Koreans turned over the 55 boxes to Byrd and other US officials at Wonsan on July 27 they said the cases contained remains of an undetermined number of Americans, but the only identification item provided was a single military dog tag, Mr Byrd said.  Two members of that person\u0026rsquos family have been notified, Kelly McKeague, the director of the Defence POW-MIA Accounting Agency, told reporters.  Mr McKeague declined to reveal the name on the dog tag.  Mr Byrd said the North Koreans at Wonsan provided what he described as a \u0026ldquoshort bit, a little paragraph of information with each of the 55 boxes.  The most significant bit of information in each case was the name of the village where the remains were recovered, he said.  One of the villages was Sin Hung-ri, which he said is on the east side of the Chosin Reservoir where US Army soldiers fought a fierce battle in the fall of 1950 after Chinese forces entered the war.  North Korea had told American officials more than once in recent years that it had about 200 sets of US war remains in storage.  Mr McKeague said the North Koreans who provided the 55 boxes last week did not say whether they have others.  He added the US is prepared to discuss arrangements for future US-North Korean excavations but this process is not yet underway, but his laboratory in Hawaii has already begun working on the remains.  The first step, he said, is sampling the bones for DNA that potentially could be matched with DNA samples provided over the years by relatives of Korean War MIAs.  If matches are achieved, identification can be done relatively quickly, he said, but in other cases the identification work will take years.  The forensics work in some cases is aided by records of chest X-rays that US soldiers commonly were given upon entering the military, as well as dental records."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-sir-michael-caine-in-expletive-laden-trailer-for-hatton-garden-heist-film","story":"  Sir Michael stars alongside Jim Broadbent, Sir Tom Courtenay, Ray Winstone, Sir Michael Gambon, Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Cox in the film about the notorious jewellery robbery of April 2015.

Or, in the case of the mural currently being uncovered at St Patrick\u0026rsquos Catholic Church in the city\u0027s Cowgate, under five coats of paint and 200 years of both erasure and forgetfulness.  In an little-used apse of the church \u0026ndash which played a central role in the formation of Hibernian Football Club and is credited as being the childhood parish of Irish revolutionary James Connolly \u0026ndash restorers are this week uncovering a spectacular depiction of Christ\u0026rsquos Ascension.  The large mural, oil on white plaster, was painted by Alexander Runciman, one of the most important artistic figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, and has been described as \u0026ldquonothing less than the first significant public religious art in Scotland since the Reformation.  The academic and art critic, Professor Duncan MacMillan, has been key to the discovery of the mural: he deduced the painting was in the church in the late 1960s.  He said: \u0026ldquoI began to think about how we could recover it, 50 years ago, and it\u0026rsquos been a long haul, but now I think we are underway - we have the right skills, the modern materials and because it was painted out only 40 years into its life, so under all that paint, it is relatively clean.  \u0026ldquoIt will be his only surviving work on this scale, and it is unique.  Special gels are now being used to remove the up to five coats of paint to assess how much of the mural has survived, and to begin a process \u0026ndash as yet uncosted \u0026ndash of renovating the entire work.  The history of the painting - celebrated, obscured, forgotten and now revived - is not one only of Church history, but one of societal change.  Edinburgh-born Runciman painted the work over several months in 1774.  His original commission had come from the Episcopalian Church, but when that congregation largely moved from the deteriorating Old Town of Edinburgh to the New Town, the building was taken over, in 1818, by the United Presbyterians.  Disapproving of idolatry, they painted over it - and it has lain under layers of whitewash and household paint since.  When the Catholic Church reconstituted the building in 1856, becoming a key religious and social centre for the large immigrant Irish community, they did not know about the art work.  The church itself was also re-orientated: when Runciman, who died in 1785, painted the Ascension, it was the spectacular artistic pediment to the altar, which faced east.  But by the late 19th century, the church now faced north with its Sanctuary at right angles to its former placing, and the painting was hidden to the side.  The exploratory work this week is being undertaken by Edinburgh-based conservator, Owen Davison, and Nicola Grimaldi, senior lecturer in the conservation of fine art at Northumbria University, Newcastle.  The work, to ascertain the scale, feasibility and cost of full restoration, is being led by the Runciman Apse Trust, which is chaired by the former Lord Advocate, Lord Andrew Hardie.  The efforts to restore the Ascension are taking place alongside with four of his subsidiary paintings: Christ and the Woman of Samaria the Return of the Prodigal Moses and Elijah, which hang beneath it.  The academic and art critic, Professor Duncan MacMillan, has been key to the discovery of the mural: he deduced the painting was in the church in the late 1960s.  He said: \"When I realised it had been painted over, I began to think about how we could recover it, 50 years ago, and its been a long haul, but now I think we are underway - we have the right skills, the modern materials and of course because it was painted out only 40 years into its life, so under all that paint, it is relatively clean.  \"Where Owen has been working, the paint surface is clean and pretty, you can see how brilliant the paint is, but we don\u0027t know what the damage is.\"  Professor MacMillan added: \"It will be his only surviving work on this scale, and is unique.  \"We don\u0027t know what the Ascension looks like...he painted very quickly, with excitement, so there isn\u0027t a formal drawing of what it looks like, it is a mystery.  \"It is going to be very exciting.  \"We don\u0027t know how much it is going to cost, but we don\u0027t think it will be an astronomical amount, and it should take a year or so, if we get the money.  \"After the Reformation, this is the first major piece of religious art since the 16th century, even in England there is not much that is comparable, not on this scale.\"  The church\u0027s priest, Mgr Philip Kerr, said: \"The painting had really been forgotten about, but since the 1970s there has been an interest in doing something - but I think we have the momentum now to get this accomplished.  \"I would very much like to see it recovered...it is a great and exciting opportunity.  \"I used to come to Mass here as a child, but my parents did not talk about these things in a major way: and it is an Ascension, which is a key biblical theme.\""},{"url":null,"title":"daviot to hold first flower pot competition","story":"        Residents of Daviot will notice a number of colourful and unusual flower pots around the village thanks to the first ever flower pot competition.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail. It will see the construction of new station platforms, lifts/overbridge, passenger waiting shelters, a new access road, a 160 space car park, a pedestrian and cycle path and secure cycle parking facilities. The new station, which accompanies Network Rail’s Aberdeen to Inverness Improvement Project, is due to re-open to passenger services in late 2019.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

prince \u0026ndash also known as the Duke of Rothesay \u0026ndash is a regular visitor to the region, and last visited in 2017 when he did an impromptu tour of the various marquees at the Mey Highland and Cultural Games.Earlier this year, the future king declared himself a fan of the Groat, namechecking it as one of three newspapers he has \u0026ldquoenjoyed keeping in touch with.On Friday, the duke will visit Kongsberg Maritime, an important employer in Wick started by local entrepreneurs who trained at Dounreay.The company manufactures underwater cameras and harsh environment CCTV systems for subsea applications within different markets ranging from oil and gas, remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) technology, civil engineering and aquaculture.It employs and trains local people in skilled engineering and IT positions and was recently acquired by Imenco, a Norwegian company established in 1979.His royal highness will meet staff and have an opportunity to view the production process and see examples of the technology to learn about its application across the world.The duke is also scheduled to attend the young entrepreneurs and businesses event at Mackay\u0026rsquos Hotel.The event, organised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce and part of a series of events that take place throughout the year, aims to celebrate young entrepreneurs in the county and provide a networking opportunity with mentors and the agencies responsible for assisting and promoting business start-ups and entrepreneurship.There, he will meet civic leaders, chamber representatives, young business attendees and support agencies.In May, Prince Charles stressed his support for local newspapers, saying they \u0026ldquoprovide a vital service which is as important now as it has ever been.\u0026ldquoThese papers, and hundreds like them around the country, highlight so many of the important aspects of local community life in a way that no other media could hope to do, he said in a letter to marketing service Local Media Works.\u0026ldquoThere are countless examples of local newspapers acting as powerful and effective champions for their communities, and very often it is the local media that are first to a story and who stay with it long after the national media have moved on.\u0026ldquoLocal journalism is about giving communities a voice and empowering people with the knowledge to make informed decisions.\"Sometimes, a good local newspaper communicates the aspirations or concerns of the local community to a wider audience, putting local issues on the national agenda.Friday 3 Aug 2018 7:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Sheriff finds fault with Wick motorists","story":"A SHERIFF has criticised some Wick drivers who appear to have scant regard

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Friday 3 Aug 2018 7:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services. They will need some convincing therefore that their interests lie at the heart of these proposals.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This puts the institution two per cent above the Scottish average.UHI has also performed above the Scottish sector in almost all measures and this high level of student satisfaction can be found across all areas of the partnership.Dr Iain Morrison, dean of students, said: “This wonderful result has been achieved through cohesive, coordinated and collective efforts by many people across the partnership.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors.

If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"bressay ferry service suspended ","story":"\n\nThe incident occurred at around 11am after the vessel experienced an engine failure while approaching the berth.\n, took the boat under tow and brought her back to berth in Lerwick where the vehicles on board had to reverse off.

Now they are keeping their fingers-crossed that generous businesses and donors can complete the last piece of the jigsaw\nClub treasurer Yvonne Birnie has stressed that the additional court will be a venue for all kinds of activities and groups and not just for the use of its tennis members.\nShe said: \"We are so, so close to building this covered area which will be well used by the community in the winter months and the wet days in the summer.\n\"We have been sending round letters to local businesses asking for help with the shortfall and we have had great contributions from several of them. However, we are still short and this is a last-ditch plea for anyone out there to help us meet the target.\n\"Without being able to confirm this extra money to funders by Monday then the project will fall through \u0026ndash all of the funding that has been put together from several sources will be lost.\n\"This really is the last chance. We will not have another opportunity to source the majority of the funding that is now in place.\"\nMrs Birnie said that donations would only be drawn down if the target is reached and payment would not be required for a further month.\nThe covered court will be twice the size of a tennis court with the polymeric surface and players and other users protected by a stretched canopy.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nFriday 3 Aug 2018 7:37 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Sleat-and-Strath.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

This provided an excellent opportunity to grow our relations with the Chinese community and we continue to work hard to promote Mid and East Antrim as an attractive location for international investment.\n  \n“Council’s Chief Executive, Anne Donaghy, has also been in contact with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which is working to establish more Council partnerships, and we look forward to continuing this exciting work.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894412.jpg--.jpg?1533025551000\n","title":"wooden it be nice to have fairyland in your backyard","story":"  \nIF you drive down towards the Glens today, you\u0027re in for a big surprise!\n  \nFor, nestled among the swathes of green fields you’ll stumble upon a real life fairyland.\n  \nDriving through the winding roads of Newtowncrommelin, a little white washed cottage catches the eye and behind this cottage lies Littleworld - land of the little people!\n  \nStanding proudly is what is believed to be the largest fairy house in the world.\n  \nLovingly handcrafted from a Red Sequoia tree, the huge structure comes complete with a little rounded door and little quaint windows, and inside there’s room for four people.\n  \nThe brains behind this project is Sean McKeown - a former bricklayer and painter.\n  \nIt took three weeks with a chainsaw to painstakingly carve out the inside of this tree.\n  \nBut with a lot of determination, imagination - and of course, a little help from the fairies - his magical masterpiece came to life.\n  \n dropped into Littleworld last week where it was clear to see that Sean is passionate about his project.\n  \n He is building a reputation as ‘The Fairy Man’ as visitors from across the world flock to see this whimsical attraction.\n  \n Sean is no stranger to developing fairy trails with much of his work on display at Galgorm Fairy Trails.\n  \nHe has also completed work for trails in Scotland, Stormont and Malahide Castle and enjoys the awe and wonderment the public glean from his intricate creations.\n  \nSean has carved a giant’s hand into his garden and the story goes that it is the hand of Finn McCool’s cousin!\n  \nOne day he annoyed the fairies - who are quite secretive and like to be left alone - and so they buried him deep in the ground! \n  \nHe clutched at the earth trying to get out but the only thing that remains of him is his giant fingers!\n  \nSean welcomes tour groups as well as school children to Littleworld where he regales them with mystical tales of the elusive fairies.\n  \nHe is currently working on a development which will involve a tunnel from the main fairyhouse, covered in meadow mix to create what he describes as a kind of “Disneyworld underground!”\n  \nSean said: “I get up in the morning and I am eager to get started on a new creation. I’ve always had an imagination and this affords me the opportunity to let my imagination run wild!\n  \n“I am hoping to attract more schools to Littleworld as fairies and the trails are all about experiencing nature.\n  \n“Ipads and technology are great - but this is about getting children outdoors in the fresh air and learning about nature and their surroundings.”\n  \nSean said his family are every bit as intrigued as the public to see what he’s up to next and he laughed: “My grandson thinks his grandad’s nuts!”\n  \nSean stressed his home is open to everyone and said he often opens his curtains to see people taking pictures of his little cottage!\n  \nSean is happy to extend a warm Irish welcome to anyone who knocks on his door - even putting up a group of weary French travellers for the night!\n  \nSpeaking with Sean, his enthusiasm for his business is infectious.\n  \nHe is full of ideas, he is full of stories and he is keen to see the Glens of Antrim expand as a real tourist attraction.\n  \nIt is clear to see that each carefully sculpted design is a real labour of love, with tiny stepping stones, doors and windows housing the fairies.\n  \n\n  \nEach visitor to Littleworld will come away with their very own fairy and Sean is currently challenging those with fairies to see how far they can travel!\n  \nSo far, one intrepid little fairy has made the journey across the Atlantic to Pennsylvania, USA!\n  \nAnd nothing delights Sean more than to see the journeys these little people take as he encourages people to post pictures of the fairies’ adventures to his Littleworld facebook page.\n  \nVisitors shower their praise for Sean with one stating: “ The stunning workmanship that has been put into these houses is second to none. Everything is done to perfection and made with love.”\n  \nAnother said: “His fairy houses are fantasy made real!”\n  \nSean is hoping to get his business operational for Christmas - and what more magical place to be for the most magical time of the year!\n  \nSean concluded: “It really is the best job in the world!”\n  \nYou can visit Sean at Littleworld, 25 Old Cushendun Road, or pop on to his facebook page - Littleworld Newton-Crommelin. A website is being developed and will soon be available to make bookings - and you never know you might even spot a fairy!\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/wk28026-8492781.jpg","title":"65215  ","story":"    \nTHOUSANDS of mourners are expected to make the pilgrimage to Garryduff Presbyterian Church in Ballymoney on Wednesday to pay their respects to William Dunlop.\nFuneral arrangements have been put in place for the 32-year-oldmotorcyclist who tragically lost his life after an accident during a practice session for the Skerries 100 road races on Saturday, July 7.\nThe popular Ballymoney man was involved in an incident at the Sam\u0027s Tunnel section of the County Dublin circuit.\nThe Funeral Service in Garryduff Presbyterian Church will take place on Wednesday at 1pm followed by interment in the adjoining churchyard.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

John Kirkpatrick paid testament to William\u0027s character.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup tries to block northern ireland council flying pride flag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"parliament website lists ian paisley as independent","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"union jack a flag of convenience for parts of dup leadership says lord adonis","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

bad news for would-be millionaires in Northern Ireland is that it is the region of the UK with the least winners. \n\nThe province sits at the bottom of the table with 117 winners of £1 million or more and 748 of £500,000 or more.\n\nThis no doubt may have something to do with the population of Northern Ireland being much smaller than other regions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThe Midlands just edges out the South East as the home of winners of £50,000 or more – at 5,705 ahead of the South East’s 5,221.\n\nScotland is still home to the largest lottery win claimed in the UK – £161 million, won in 2011 by Colin and Chris Weir from Largs in North Ayrshire – and to 472 other winners of £1 million or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin and Chris Weir celebrating in 2011(Lynne

likely to win a major National Lottery prize, according to statistics most recently updated in May last year, are Cleveland (TS) and Romford (RM), closely followed by Warrington (WA), Liverpool (L), Newport (NP) and Newcastle (NE).\n\nThe postcodes are ranked by the number of major prizes of £50,000 or more won per head of adult population since the National Lottery began.\n\nThe TS postcode, which includes Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Stockton-on-Tees, has more winners per head than anywhere else in the country.\n\nThe statistics, which include both publicity and non-publicity winners,

about possible manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNelson Chamisa said police raided opposition headquarters in the capital and seized computers (Jerome Delay/AP)\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Mr Chamisa said police raided opposition headquarters in the capital and seized computers, while officers said 18 people in the offices were arrested.\n\nHe alleged police were looking for what he called evidence of vote-rigging, but said the evidence already had been moved to a “safe house”.\n\nBoth the opposition and ruling party had earlier on Thursday claimed victory in the presidential race, the first since the fall of long-time leader Robert Mugabe.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"zimbabwes mnangagwa wins first postmugabe election","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Mr Mnangagwa received 50.8% of the vote while main opposition challenger Nelson Chamisa received 44.3%.\n\nWhile election day was peaceful in a break from the past, deadly violence on Wednesday against people protesting alleged vote-rigging reminded many Zimbabweans of the decades of military-backed repression under Mr Mugabe.\n\nWestern election observers who were banned in previous votes have expressed concern at the military’s “excessive” force in the capital, Harare. Their assessments of the election are crucial to the lifting of international sanctions on a country whose economy collapsed years ago.\n\n\nThank you Zimbabwe!\n\nI am humbled to be elected President of the Second Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nThough we may have been divided at the polls, we are united in our dreams.\n\nThis is a new beginning. Let us join hands, in peace, unity \u0026 love, \u0026 together build a new Zimbabwe for all! \npic.twitter/FbdrixAktR\n\n— President of Zimbabwe (@edmnangagwa) \nAugust 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\nShortly before the election commission’s announcement, a man who said he was the chief agent with Mr Chamisa’s opposition alliance claimed that they had not signed the election results and rejected them. Police asked him to step aside.\n\nCommission chair Priscilla Chigumba urged the country to “move on” with the hopeful spirit of election day and beyond the “blemishes” of Wednesday’s chaos, saying: “May God bless this nation and its people.”\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the ruling party and the main opposition group both claimed victory, deepening a political crisis that was worsened by Wednesday’s violence in Harare as the military swept in with gunfire to disperse opposition supporters alleging vote-rigging.\n\nThe death toll rose to six, with 14 injured, police said, and 18 people were arrested at the offices of the main opposition party amid tensions over a vote that was supposed to restore trust in Zimbabwe after decades of Mr Mugabe’s rule.\n\nWhile Mr Mnangagwa and the ruling party accused the opposition of inciting the violence, the opposition, human rights activists and international election observers condemned the “excessive” force used against protesters and appealed to all sides to exercise restraint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZimbabwean’s main opposition candidate Nelson Chamisa (AP Photo/Jerome Delay)\n\n\n\n\nThe international election observers also urged the commission to reveal the presidential results as soon as possible, saying delays would increase speculation about vote-rigging.\n\nMr Mnangagwa called for an “independent investigation” into Wednesday’s violence, saying those responsible “should be identified and brought to justice”.\n\nMr Mnangagwa was a longtime Mugabe confidante before his firing in November led his allies in the military to step in and push Mr Mugabe to resign after 37 years in power. Thousands of jubilant Zimbabweans celebrated in the streets of Harare, greeting the military with selfies and cheers.\n\nSince taking office, the 75-year-old Mr Mnangagwa has tried to recast himself as a voice of reform, declaring that Zimbabwe was “open for business” and inviting long-banned Western election observers to observe Monday’s vote, which he pledged would be free and fair.\n"}]
