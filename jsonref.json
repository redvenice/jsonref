He has inspired and infuriated generations of listeners and we’ll miss him. He represents something increasingly rare.People who don’t listen much to the programme sometimes read stories about complaints over his interviewing style, and assume this is some musty old gammon, an upmarket patriarch. Not so: the essence of John Humphrys is a bounding, hybrid vigour.If the BBC was a dog show, its public-school Dimblebys, Vines and Edward Stourtons would be high-bred, languid Great Danes or well-trained gundogs (and Paxo a pedigree Alsatian of elegant appearance but uncertain temperament).Humphrys would be a scrappy, scruffy mongrel terrier. Off he’d go, chasing every rabbit, catching every ball, leaping on the grandest sofa with mud on his paws and a bark of amused defiance.Here is the news: John Humphrys to QUIT the Today programme...From rustling sweet wrappers in cinemas to those ‘sorry you...BBC\u0027s focus on \u0027erse\u0027 comedy is just \u0027PC panic\u0027 that...The vulnerable teenager abused and discarded by powerful men...Share this articleIt is quite wrong to identify him with what the BBC calls ‘a babble of poshness’ in its absurd new recruitment ad to attract journalists from erse backgrounds.He was born in Cardiff to a family that knew hunger one great-grandmother, he discovered, was in the workhouse. He left school at 15 despite a grammar-school scholarship and did paper rounds (his first pay packet in the Fifties was £1.17s.6d on the Penarth Times, less than he got from the paper round so he kept that going, too).John was the first reporter at the Aberfan disaster when 116 children and 28 adults died as a junior school was engulfed by a coal tip.The trouble with such ‘great moments’ in journalism, he reflected, is that they are also great tragedies: for all his toughness, there is deep and honest sentiment in him. He worked as a foreign correspondent, set up the BBC New York bureau — a boozy, raucous time by all accounts.On the road, he reported on everything from Britain’s dock strikes in the Seventies to Nixon’s resignation and the moment when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe.          On the road, he reported on everything from Britain’s dock strikes in the Seventies to Nixon’s resignation and the moment when Rhodesia became ZimbabweHe was diplomatic correspondent, then for a few years anchored the Nine O’Clock News at the point when newsreaders, for the first time on the BBC, doubled as writer-editors (in the cut-glass days of Angela Rippon, they didn’t).But his arrival on Today to join Brian Redhead sparked a love affair with the job: he revels in the sheer fun of being first up in the morning with a story to tell.He reads the papers with fierce attention and swallows complex briefs fast.Aggressive at times, contrary quite often, he is fuelled by the adrenaline of news and genuine interest. Inside him vibrates the inquisitive, argumentative, determined cub reporter he was, loving intellectual friction. There is nothing smug or entitled he does not trade in long, self-important complicated questions but often in alarmingly brusque simple ones.His stamina is amazing: I presented Today four days a week for three-and-a-half years up to 1981, and remember the 3.30am alarm clocks, the briefings read with bleary eyes, the empty stomach assaulted by too much coffee.But he thrives: in recent years I had to visit the Today studio for the live trail of Midweek, and it was always bouncier when John was on. He would take his eyes off the ubiquitous prompt-and-briefing screens to crack some joke during a tape, or shove me a flippant note during the sports news.After one particularly gruelling live political interview, the note told me how he was feeling: ‘Always terrified after all these years.’That is the essence of Humphrys: taking nothing for granted, including his own abilities.As for the money, he was much maligned during the row about the gender pay gap at the Beeb. Executives will confirm that he never asked for the absurd sums which the BBC at one point paid him — reportedly £600,000 a year.He spends millions on his Kitchen Table Charities Trust, supporting small causes including sanitation and dignity projects for teenage girls in sub-Saharan Africa.He willingly halved his salary when the BBC anxiety about pay began. But after former China editor Carrie Gracie returned to the BBC newsroom and justifiably complained about insulting inequalities in pay, some mean spirit leaked a tape of John teasing North America editor Jon Sopel.‘How much of your salary are you prepared to hand over to Carrie . . .’ he was recorded saying. ‘I’ve handed over more than you f***ing earn but I’m still left with more than anybody else . . .’There was confected outrage against him — the then Loneliness Minister, the ridiculous Tracey Crouch even refused to be interviewed by him about anything.But if you actually listen, it is clear that Humphrys is sending up and winding up his soberer colleague, pretending he would ask him about it on air while Sopel was reporting on Trump. It’s quite funny: newsroom banter. Women do that, too, you know.But in any case, money is not what drives Humphrys: the fun of the job does. He won’t much like it when he does retire.Curiosity, enjoyment and a bit of nerviness give him his edge. Live radio is both fun and alarming if you lack a carapace of smug over-confidence.If he has seemed belligerent at times, deploying his full armoury on too small a target, as a listener I generally put it down to a sort of overspill of frustration with the absurdity of the whole world: ‘Lord, what fools these mortals be!’As for his mild — and I suspect deliberately clowning — bafflement of popular culture, either you laugh with him and mutter, ‘Keep up, grandpa!’ or be po-facedly offended.I, too, have shouted at him for interrupting someone really harmless, and as Today’s editor, Sarah Sands, weakly murmured after one entertaining car-crash moment with former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman: ‘Fashion isn’t John’s area of expertise.’He had teased Shulman about unhealthy body shapes and uncomfortable shoes, and she lamented: ‘I was confronted by a grey-haired guy in chinos hectoring me on the business I had worked in for a quarter of a century and which he neither knew, nor cared, much about.’          That is the essence of Humphrys: taking nothing for granted, including his own abilitiesBut who could resist his blokey challenge to absurd fashion columns about the French tuck (leaving half your shirt hanging out like Meghan Markle). When men do it, they’re slobs, he said, but with women it’s fashion, adding: ‘As for ripped jeans. I rest my case.’Another pointless row came after he asked actor Rupert Everett whether he regretted, for career reasons, having come out as gay.There was prim fury all over Twitter, but Everett had talked about this before, and made it clear that, yes, it had damaged him. And he was on Today to discuss his film about Oscar Wilde’s disgrace.Would you prefer a veneer of pretend respect for everything, or a bit of grit? Is it not worth it for moments like Humphrys’ ferocious demolition over Jimmy Savile of BBC Director-General George Entwistle — Humphrys’ ultimate boss at the time?Or DUP politician Nelson McCausland’s comment that his was ‘a compassionate party’, only to have Humphrys respond: ‘Compassionate? I think if you were a gay person or a woman wanting an abortion . . .’Maybe our appreciation will grow with memory, and many of the charges against him weaken on examination: Former Home Office minister Hazel Blears was indeed interrupted several times in an interview about police intelligence failures, but reading the transcript you notice she simply isn’t answering a straight question.And misogynism? Nothing could be further from the truth. He cheered me on during my BBC years to the end, and long maintained that Today needs a woman editor.As for his most furious detractor, Tory minister Jonathan Aitken did accuse him of ‘poisoning the well of democratic debate’. But four years later was himself jailed for perverting the course of justice.No, on balance John Humphrys has been, for more than 30 years, a tonic — like a cold, clean, bracing morning dip. And we’re all the better for that."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/15/11/503234A700000578-0-image-m-26_1537005986869.jpg","title":"Minister NOT crack toxic leasehold deals trap families blames excited buyers","story":"    Heather Wheeler MP, Minister for Housing, speaking at the Housing, Communities and Local Government CommitteeSome double charges every decade, while other freeholds are sold on to third parties who only allow homeowners to buy them out for exorbitant fees.Ministers have pledged to outlaw the sale of newly built homes with leases following a public outcry. But Mrs Wheeler\u0027s comments suggest those already hit by the problem will be left to fend for themselves.Speaking at a Commons committee, Mrs Wheeler said legal advice showed legislation would be \u0027horrendously expensive\u0027, adding: \u0027I\u0027d much rather go down the voluntary route. There have been agreements between freeholders and leaseholders and clearly we want that momentum to carry on.\u0027The Mail has led the way in exposing the leasehold scandal, including where clauses make ground rents double every decade.The issue has been dubbed \u0027the PPI of the housebuilding industry\u0027 – a reference to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance by banks.     Joanne Darbyshire said she was mis-sold her home because of hidden and excessive ground rentsCampaigners say developers used the \u0027feudal\u0027 agreements to squeeze extra cash out of families desperate to get on the housing ladder – many with the support of the taxpayer through Help to Buy. Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign, said: \u0027Heather Wheeler\u0027s performance was absolutely appalling.\u0027Leaseholders are in uproar about this. When your life has been blighted by this scandal and you are still living this nightmare daily, and you hear what she is saying, it is just not acceptable.          Joanne Darbyshire (pictured) claims she was mis-sold her home in Bolton because of hidden ground rentsThey have since been given a quote of between £23,000 and £33,000 to buy their home in Lostock, Bolton, outright.They have been offered an RPI-linked ground rent contract by Taylor Wimpey but say this would still mean paying £10,000 to buy the freehold.Mrs Darbyshire, right, says: \u0027There\u0027s no end in sight. People say to me you should have read the small print but none of these things were in there.\u0027Andrea Harris bought a three-bedroom terraced house from Taylor Wimpey – but says she wasn\u0027t told about ground rent.The 39-year-old purchased the property for £160,000 with her former partner in 2008.          Andrea Harris (pictured) also claimed she was not told about the ground rent However, she was then hit with an annual ground rent bill of £200, which doubled to £400 last year. In another ten years it could double again to £800. Miss Harris, who lives in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, now says she cannot sell the house and cannot afford to pay down the mortgage or buy the freehold.She says she is stuck making mortgage interest payments on a home she fears she\u0027ll never be able to pass on to her daughter Gabriella, eight, pictured left with her mother.Miss Harris said: \u0027I wanted this to be a family home that I could pass on ... but now I will never be able to do that.\u0027The Government isn\u0027t doing anything to help people like me – we\u0027re still stuck with crippling ground rents every year.\u0027                                                    Home Secretary Sajid Javid vowed when he held the housing portfolio to outlaw the use of leaseholds on newly-built homes in December 2017, branding the practice \u0027feudal\u0027.But more than a year later, campaigners say those trapped in toxic contracts are no closer to escaping them.Despite many leaseholders claiming they were not made aware of the full terms of their contracts, and suggestions it was similar to the PPI scandal, Mrs Wheeler said she did not agree it was an example of mis-selling.The 59-year-old, who owns her constituency home in Burton-on-Trent outright according to the Land Registry, previously sparked controversy when she tweeted that the \u0027British Empire\u0027 came first with 396 medals in the Rio Olympics, referring to Britain and countries that were formerly its colonies.Mrs Wheeler told MPs the comparison to PPI was difficult \u0027because in effect with PPI you were sold something you really didn\u0027t need, whereas this is completely different\u0027. She added: \u0027There is a contract, there was legal advice but perhaps people are caught up in the moment because it is their first purchase and it is incredibly exciting.\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve been fleeced for years and it\u0027s come to an end\u0027:...Wimbledon tennis chiefs are on the brink of buying...Fleeced on their leases: The families being hit with soaring...Flat owner who had new kitchen and bathroom fitted has...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/01/4B97F2A900000578-0-image-m-87_1524789657174.jpg","title":"UN experts say North Korea shielding missiles airports","story":"    Hide and seek: Kim Jong-un\u0027s nuclear missile programme remains intact despite the deal signed with Donald Trump\u0027The Democratic People\u0027s Republic of Korea\u0027s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes remain intact,\u0027 said the report, using the official name for North Korea.\u0027The panel found that the DPRK is using civilian facilities, including airports for ballistic missile assembly and testing with the goal of effectively preventing \u0027decapitation\u0027 strikes.\u0027The Trump administration has led the drive at the United Nations to impose a series of tough economic sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear tests and missile launches in 2017.But North Korea has resorted to illegal transfers of oil, fuel and coal using a network of ships at sea to circumvent the UN-imposed measures aimed at depriving Pyongyang of revenue to build up its weapons programmes.\u0027These violations render the latest United Nations sanctions ineffective by flouting the caps on the DPRK\u0027s import of petroleum products and crude oil as well as the coal ban imposed in 2017,\u0027 said the report.          North Korea\u0027s nuclear and ballistic missiles have been hidden by airports and other facilities, UN experts have warned UN sanctions resolutions have set ceilings for North Korea of four million barrels of crude oil per year and 500,000 barrels of refined oil products.\u0027The panel found that DPRK ports and airports are used for rampant violations of the resolution ranging from illegal oil imports and coal exports to the smuggling of bulk cash by DPRK nationals,\u0027 said the report.North Korea continues to violate an arms embargo and attempted to supply light weapons to Syria, the Huthi rebels in Yemen, Libya and Sudan, it added.A bromance blossoms as Kim and Moon hold hands during...\u0027I want to be able to watch Iran\u0027: Trump says he\u0027s keeping...Trump boasts that the Taliban are only talking peace because...\u0027They said they were totally misquoted,\u0027 Trump brushes off...Share this article\u0027Financial sanctions remain some of the most poorly implemented and actively evaded measures of the sanctions regime,\u0027 said the panel.North Korean financial institutions operate in at least five countries, despite UN-imposed restrictions, while the country\u0027s diplomats help their country evade sanctions by controlling bank accounts in multiple countries.  The UN panel found that Pyongyang is using civilian facilities, including airports, for the assembly of ballistic missiles, like the Hwasong-14 pictured at its launch in July 2017The panel\u0027s findings were in line with US intelligence assessments that North Korea is unlikely to scrap its weapons programmes but may offer to scale back its activities to win sanctions relief.Last October dictator Kim Jong-un agreed to get rid of all the rogue state\u0027s nuclear weapons, according to a deal he signed at a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.The hermit kingdom pledged to abolish all nuclear materials and facilities to achieve \u0027complete\u0027 denuclearisation,  Moon Jae-in has claimed after the pair\u0027s meeting three months ago.Kim and US President Donald Trump pledged to work towards denuclearisation at their landmark summit in June last year in Singapore, but the agreement was short on specific details. After his third summit in Pyongyang, Moon said the North was ready to invite international experts to watch the dismantling of a key missile site and would close the main Yongbyon nuclear complex if Washington took reciprocal actions.          Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un shake hands at the start of their historic summit at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa Island, Singapore, in June last yearNorth Korea could have as many as 60 nuclear weapons, the South said after a summit earlier this month.According to South Korean government reports, North is believed to have produced 110 lbs of weaponised plutonium - enough for at least eight bombs. Last week, US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said North Korea\u0027s leaders see nuclear weapons capability as \u0027critical to regime survival.\u0027US special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun will hold talks in Pyongyang on Wednesday to press for progress and steps that could be touted as success during the upcoming summit, which is likely to take place in Vietnam."},{"url":null,"title":"YouTubers buy ticket Australia create Earth sandwich","story":"      Jay Swingler (pictured) was filmed placing another slice of bread in front of iconic Australian landmark the Sydney Opera House          British YouTubers Jay Swingler and Romell Henry placed a slice of bread in a London garden, documenting their efforts \u0027Only the dead should be buried\u0027: Daredevils slammed for...\u0027I don\u0027t care… It\u0027s not like I\u0027m a drink driver\u0027: YouTube...Share this articleIn the video, the pair film themselves making the loaf from scratch after buying a new bread machine.It also shows them booking expensive first-class return flights, which cost more than £14,000 ($25,000) in order to carry out the stunt.

forerunner of a US-led invasion and says he will therefore not let the shipment enter from Colombia          A wider view of the Tienditas Bridge on the border between the Colombian city of Cucuta and Tachira, Venezuela show where the blockage has been set upThis comes as Venezuelan army continues its blockage of a bridge on the border with Colombia ahead of an anticipated humanitarian aid dispatch. Maduro claims humanitarian aid is a forerunner of a US-led invasion, and defended his decision to order a barricade of the bridge by saying that \u0027no one will enter, not one invading soldier.\u0027 Opposition leader Juan Guaido, now recognised as interim president by the West and the US, claims that up to 300,000 people face death if the aid being blocked by Maduro\u0027s army is not delivered. The opposition-dominated National Assembly, led by presidential challenger Guaido, had warned the armed forces that blocking aid would mean crossing a \u0027red line\u0027.\u0027You

wasVenezuelan military officers used a tanker truck and huge shipping container to block access to the Tienditas bridge, which links Cucuta, Colombia to Urena, Venezuela.Franklyn Duarte, an opposition lawmaker from the border state of Tachira, told AFP that troops from the armed forces were blocking the crossing.The aid delivery was being coordinated by Guaido, who has declared himself interim president of the oil-rich country and now enjoys the backing of some 40 countries as Venezuela\u0027s legitimate leader.Maduro, 56, has repeatedly accused the United States of fomenting a coup. His blockage of food, medicine and necessities to hundreds of thousands of starving Venezuelans came as weapons were discovered in cargo which the government claims was sent from Florida. The weapons, including  19 rifles and high-calibre ammunition, were found at an airport in the city of Valencia, having been transported on an Airbus jet that flew in on Sunday, the Interior Ministry wrote on Twitter.It is not known who the intended recipient of the weapons was. The US, which has not ruled out a military intervention in crisis-wracked Venezuela, was the first to recognize him as acting president, followed by a dozen Latin American countries.In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Donald Trump reaffirmed US support for Guaido, saying \u0027we stand with the

He was boosted on Saturday by the defection of a top air force general.His fledgling alternative administration will hold talks in Washington February 14 on responding to \u0027the largest hemispheric humanitarian crisis in modern history.\u0027Maduro disclosed Monday that he sent Pope Francis a letter seeking help in mediating the country\u0027s crisis. The pope told journalists Tuesday that this would require agreement from both the government and the opposition.\u0027Getting close to both sides to enact the possibilities of dialogue. That\u0027s how diplomacy works,\u0027 the pope said on the plane bringing him back from the United Arab Emirates. Eurasia Group analysts say the humanitarian crisis \u0027represents a lose-lose gambit for Maduro\u0027 who will either have to allow the goods to enter the country, further bolstering Guaido, or force the military to block their entry, risking a backlash in the streets.Maduro, though, remains steadfast.          Supporters wave the Venezuelan flag as  Maduro speaks during a meeting with representatives of the transport sector in Caracas\u0027Venezuela doesn\u0027t have to beg to anyone,\u0027 he said. \u0027If they want to help, then end the blockade and the sanctions.\u0027Under Maduro\u0027s stewardship, oil-dependent Venezuela has plunged into an economic crisis, suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine.Eurasia said US oil sanctions are \u0027set to have a broad impact\u0027 with the government facing \u0027the prospect of running out of gasoline, which could serve as another social catalyst.\u0027 Guaido branded Maduro illegitimate over his reelection in May, which the opposition boycotted after several of its leaders were either jailed, barred or forced into exile.The US and EU dismissed the elections as a fraud.Maduro has flatly rejected demands for new elections, telling Spanish television he would not \u0027cave in to pressure.\u0027He has supported plans for a meeting of Latin American and EU states in a \u0027Contact Group\u0027 in Montevideo on Thursday, though.The United Nations said 40 people were killed in clashes with security forces in a week of protests last month, coinciding with Guaido\u0027s self-proclamation as acting leader.

Furious honey badger charges towards...Share this article\u0027Even more unusual is the fact this is a male leopard yet he was not posing any threat to the baby impala who was standing in front of it and they were both nuzzling\u0027.The video, posted on the YouTube page of Capture the Wild, was filmed from a safari truck driving through the Sabi Sands Game Reserve which adjoins the world famous Kruger National Park in north-east South Africa.Mr Muller can be heard saying:\u0027It is still alive, they are licking at each other. It is just born and the leopard is just licking at it\u0027.           All over: As soon as the baby impala realises the danger, it starts to run and the leopard gives chase          No chance: The baby leopard effectively sealed its own fate when it tried to outrun the predator in the Sabi Sands Game Reserve in north-east South Africa          Easy win: Video footage captured during a safari trip shows the leopard kicking the baby\u0027s legs out from under itHowever after a very long minute checking each other out the baby impala makes the fatal mistake of trying to run away which activates the leopards hunting instincts.The leopard immediately follows the baby impala and trips it up three times with its paw before the doomed antelope makes a brave but hopeless bolt for the bush.The leopard which can hit speeds of nearly 40mph is far too quick for the newly born and quickly pulls it down and grabs its neck in its jaws. The leopard then walks past their safari truck with the baby impala no more than an hour old hanging by its neck from his jaw to find a quiet place to feed.Mr Muller added: \u0027We were on an elephant drive when we stumbled on a female impala which had given birth in what I estimate to be the last hour and it was still wet.          Done dinner: The leopard captures the baby impala and carried it off by the neck\u0027Female impalas generally leave the herd for the birth and the mother and new born were alone and we watched for five minutes as the new born clumsily begin to stand.\u0027Then all of a sudden there was a commotion and Dewane, an old dominant male leopard, who must have been stalking the mum and baby emerged towards them both.\u0027The mother instinctively ran leaving Dewane alone with the baby and I began filming.\u0027I think the way Dewane behaved towards the baby at first in not killing it was caused by the confusion of the impala not running away and it supressed the trigger instinct.\u0027The leopard simply became curious about the new born impala and nuzzled up to it. They were licking each other. It is extremely rare but you know it will not end well.\u0027When the impala ran you know that it is going to die and you have mixed emotions witnessing it but it is an inevitable part of nature even if it is pretty emotional.\u0027The leopard killed the impala quickly and the circle of life continues\u0027 he said. Unbelievable!

She had spent time in the Middle East, researching a biography of Lady Hester Stanhope (she has also written a novel, and a biography of Rebecca West). Gibb had some idea, she thought, of what to expect. But she was not prepared for the degree to which a woman only made sense in that culture if she could give birth. Gibb describes the strategies she developed to explain, to deflect finally she meets Halima, seemingly the mother of one of her students, but, in fact, only a first wife: when she was unable to conceive, her husband married again, and all four family members lived together. Halima points at the dusty ground. “I am like that,” she says with breath-stopping bluntness, “the barren place where nothing grows. Ayesha is like the palm trees … See how the green parakeets congregate and sing and nest in her branches.”This is a book so much more powerful for Gibb having searched the world for childless voices. It tells the author’s own story, too, as one voice among many: her far from unusual history of undiagnosed endometriosis. “Some women just have bad periods,” as one doctor put it. These “periods” were in reality various organs bleeding in turn, causing so much internal damage that she occasionally collapsed from the pain. Gibb’s account is restrained, coloured with love and gratitude – for the husband who stands by her through her illness (she knows how many millions of men do not) for the fact that early menopause means “I have not had endometriosis for 10 years now and I know how fortunate that makes me”. But at the same time it takes years to come to terms with childlessness: “There is no sleep so deep I will not find you there,” she writes, drawing on Beckett’s Footfalls. “My unborn child, the one who will never be, finds me even in sleep.”In Ghana childless women can be called witches, or are believed to have been cursed by witches they can be sent to “witch camps”, where they are safe but exiled. Everywhere, childless women are abused (often after the first year of marriage, when the issue – always the woman’s – starts to become clear). Over and over again, they blame themselves shockingly often they choose not to continue living. During the Sri Lankan war the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam fielded combat units of suicide bombers of both sexes the women, called Black Tigresses, were often childless because, as one peace campaigner puts it, “acting as a human bomb is an understood and accepted offering for a woman who will never be a mother”. In the west, Gibb argues, the punishments include working pay (fathers in Britain earn a fifth more than childless men) longer hours, blatantly inequitable taxation and political discourse that ennobles “hard‑working families”.Gibb directs a rare outburst of fury at the TV journalist Victoria Derbyshire, who prefaced an interview about the three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi, who was found drowned on a Turkish beach, with the words: “If you’re a parent, you might find this upsetting.” What was the assumption, that if you had no child you were somehow “less caring, less kind, and consequently of less value”? In 2015 Pope Francis was only restating a common prejudice when he said in St Peter’s Square that “the choice to not have children is selfish”. The Yoruba stricture that only admits a woman to full adulthood when she has a child is just an overt codification of an internationally prevalent assumption, that the childless are in some fundamental way not properly grown up, without an equal stake or voice. When Andrea Leadsom, running against Theresa May for the Tory leadership, suggested she had “a very real stake” in the future of the country because she was a parent, Gibb found she was “untethered by something illogical, even cruel … and I am lessened in my own eyes”.The world has devised some patchwork solutions. In the Balkans there are the burrneshas, women who have forsworn sex and in return are allowed to live as men. Gibb discusses Catholic nuns, and the argument that they are spiritual mothers. There are the Kikuyu in Kenya, among more than 30 sub‑Saharan groups who officially acknowledge marriages in which two women form a family together: “You must make yourself a queen,” says one Kikuyu woman. And Gibb offers this book, too, as a small step forward, hoping that, in her acts of listening, fastidious exactitude and unflinching accounts of tragedy (it’s a hard book to read without crying at least once), she can make the case for empathy, imagination and respect as the most viable beginnings.• Aida Edemariam’s The Wife’s Tale is out in paperback (4th Estate).

Outside working hours, every pause seems almost reflexively to trigger a jolt of anxious guilt or shame that something – a laundry cycle, a tax return, a status update – remains undone.The effect of this permanent busyness is to leave us feeling that inactive states have no meaning or validity in themselves that they exist only to be filled in with some content. Inactivity increasingly exists for us as the negative of our “real” lives of activity and purpose.In my book Not Working, I try to counter this conception of human life by exploring various dimensions of inactivity. I don’t idealise non-work, which can signify depression and indifference as much as creativity, but I do argue that it’s an essential dimension of every human life, such that its loss impoverishes us imaginatively and emotionally.It’s surely no surprise that much of the inspiration for the book came from reading. I’m referring not only to the rich and varied literature on the subject, but equally to the act of reading itself. As anyone who makes a living from it will tell you, reading can be hard work. But turning away from the immediate demands of the “real” world to immerse oneself in a world made on the page – be it the speculative world of the philosopher or physicist, the reconstructed past of the historian, or the imaginary realms of the novelist or poet – is itself a refusal of the demand for useful productivity. It requires us to slow down, wait, be curious, avoid the headlong rush into practical action.Here, then, are the books I’ve found most helpful in exploring inactivity, idleness and aimlessness in all their wonderfully various forms.1. Rameau’s Nephew by Denis Diderot A kind of delirious inversion of a Platonic dialogue replacing Socrates the lover of wisdom guiding his awed pupil towards the Good with Rameau the unconscionable and entitled slob instructing the half-amused, half-disgusted Diderot in the ways of gluttony and freeloading. Diderot, editor of the epic Encyclopédie, was himself a paragon of almost unfeasible intellectual productivity and a passionate advocate for human reason. Yet one of his most brilliant and seductive creations is this shamelessly unreasonable waster and his compelling argument for making very little effort in life.2. Oblomov by Ivan GoncharovA pampered only child raised on an idyllic country estate, Oblomov is stuck with his aged, cantankerous manservant in a dusty St Petersburg apartment, unable to summon the will to get out of bed and face the ominous financial demands and administrative tasks proliferating around him. The rousing pep talks of his tireless, go-getting friend Stolz briefly propel him into life, but in the end Oblomov – whiny, self-pitying yet strangely lovable – can never resist the inexorable pull of inertia. No less than Lenin lamented the chronic malaise of “Oblomovitis” affecting the Russian people. Good for them, I say.3. The Portable Thoreau by Henry David ThoreauThis handy volume includes some of the best writings of the great American naturalist, essayist and political agitator. Walden, his record of a year-long experiment in living self-sufficiently, dares to imagine a life unencumbered by economic necessity and social obligation. Here and in great essays such as Walking and Life Without Principle, Thoreau enjoins us to the freedom of living aimlessly, guided by the lights of our own desires rather than the world’s life-denying imperative of “incessant business”. The real pleasure is to be found in Thoreau’s beautiful prose and singular voice – wry, often exasperated and just a little imperious.4. Beyond the Pleasure Principle by Sigmund FreudThis remains Freud’s most controversial work, a bold and often startling foray into speculative biology and the outer edges of the human psyche. Its central idea of a “death drive” continues to trouble its critics, as well as inspire artists, writers and philosophers. The death drive is not primarily, as is sometimes claimed, an innate destructiveness, but a resistance to the growth and expansion inherent to life. The scandalous suggestion is that behind the impulse to do, make and expand is an older and ultimately more powerful urge to lassitude and stasis. Which makes sense to me.5. The Decay of Lying and Other Essays by Oscar Wilde“To do nothing at all is the most difficult thing in the world.” The red thread running through this anthology of some of Wilde’s finest essays is his provocative disdain for action. In a surprising echo of Freud, he argues that it is always “ignorant of its direction”. We don’t know what we’re doing when we act and so are liable to make a mess of things despite our best intentions (Wilde is a brilliant companion for the Brexit age.) In The Soul of Man Under Socialism, he imagines us liberated by machines from the shackles of labour to realise our full creative possibilities. Unrealistic? Of course, but then the famous 1968 slogan, “Be realistic: demand the impossible!” could have been coined by Wilde, master of paradox.6. The Space of Literature by Maurice BlanchotThe best place to start with this enigmatic, forbidding but endlessly fascinating French philosopher and critic. Ostensibly a collection of essays on major modern writers, it’s really a sustained reflection on art as a kind of reserve of pure idleness. A prolific writer himself, Blanchot doesn’t deny that making art is hard work but it’s work that doesn’t intervene in the concrete world of historical action. In other words, art can do anything in its own world – bend and break time, space, physical reality – because it doesn’t really do anything in reality.7. A Short History of Decay by EM CioranA brilliant collection of aphorisms from the lyric philosopher of existential misery. For all his uncompromising pessimism and disgust, hope sneaks into his writing surreptitiously, through the wry humanity of his voice. Cioran takes a hammer to religious and political belief systems in the name of more than mere nihilism his primary concern is to protect a place for “doubt and sloth”’, for the “idlers and aesthetes” who “propose nothing”. It’s the spirit of the idler, after all, that stands between us and the terrible ravages of fanaticism.8. A Man Asleep by Georges PerecPerec’s early novella is a deeply unsettling portrait of a young man’s wish to sleep his life away. From the beginning, its narrator sinks inexorably into anonymity and indifference, becoming “a man of leisure, a sleepwalker, a mollusc”, concentrating all his efforts in the achievement of a state of immobility and silence. Perhaps that makes it sound dull and depressing but the disconcerting enigma of this book is how thrilling it is.9. Infinite Jest by David Foster WallaceReally? With a word count to rival War and Peace, not to mention a similar level of narrative convolution, this doorstopper may not be the first novel you associate with inactivity. But its proliferation of characters and stories all converge on the same motif: our culture’s drive to (in the words of the polemicist Neil Postman) “amuse us to death”. The titular film, circulating underground in a dystopian American future, does just that, inducing a pleasure in its viewer so extreme as to induce permanent catatonic bliss.10. My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa MoshfeghMoshfegh’s novel, published last year, reads a bit like a baroque rewriting of A Man Asleep. The unnamed narrator’s elaborate project to self-induce a year-long sleep with prescription drugs and withdraw from the vapid New York of money, bad art and worse parties takes us through various narrative detours – a needy friend, a hideous ex, a mad psychiatrist – on the way to oblivion. Few novels have conveyed so powerfully the urge, induced by our culture of permanent visibility and stimulation, to shut down.• Not Working: Why We Have to Stop by Josh Cohen is published by Granta, priced £14.99.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“Jesus, that was a dark and disturbing slice of French noir,” says Tom Mooney, who has been reading The Executioner Weeps by Frederic Dard:Daniel, a French artist, is on a break near Barcelona. Driving down a road one night, a young woman throws herself in front of his car in an apparent act of suicide. When he goes to the body, however, he realises she is still alive. Fearful of the consequences, he takes the girl back to his hotel. She awakes with severe amnesia, remembering nothing of her previous life. Daniel then becomes obsessed with her, instilling himself as her boyfriend and the central character in her new life. But, as he delves deeper into her forgotten past, he discovers the real, shocking reason she threw herself in front of his car.Grisly, grim and weaving from noir into horror, this is a very effective and highly creepy novel.Isabelle Leinster has been reading and “loving” Once Upon A River by Diane Setterfield:I have no connection to the River Thames but her description of the many stages of the river and the folk who live along its banks is captivating. The mystery of how a 4-year-old girl ended up in the river and was rescued and where she came from are central and I can’t wait to find out.“I saw somewhere that 2019 is the 50th anniversary of the first book in the Flashman series,” says RedmonT. “While I couldn’t care less about that, it did remind me how long it has been since I read them, so I’ve ed back in”:This morning, I finished the third in the series - Flash for Freedom - and am now about to start Flashman at the Charge. I think Royal Flash is by far the weakest of the series (though still brilliant) and Flashman and the Redskins the best. I urge you all to have a go at reading them if you haven’t already. As well as being extremely funny, they work as a highly entertaining history lesson - even down to the way people spoke in the mid-to-late nineteenth century2manyb00ks is enjoying The Lightning Men by Thomas Mullen, the second in the Darktown series:Crime fiction set in 1950 in Atlanta when African Americans have just joined the police force. The crime part is great but what is really interesting is how society is shifting and changing. The three main characters are well drawn and all making compromises between the law, their ethics and their families.Frontier by Can Xue has impressed Will1900:A vast, strangely ambiguous tale of people who find themselves in a dreamlike frontier town in China. Of all of her books, this one felt most like a collection of folk tales, run through with mysticism, and strange natural phenomena- for all its modernity it felt like discovering an ancient text.Yosserian has just finished Patrimony: A True Story, by Philip Roth:A memoir about his father, Herman Roth, and his death from a brain tumour. Roth has a straightforward way of telling the story of father and son, eschewing prose fireworks, as so far has all of his books I’ve read. It is poignant, and at times wryly funny. A commenter on Goodreads said that Roth showed how to be a good son. That despite Roth junior, or perhaps because of, being so keen to leave home and Roth senior, and establish his independence, he is able to loop back, and be there for his father later in life.Finally, a (beautifully written) confession by nosuchzone:I quite like being the last possible reader of a paperback - I bought the orange-banded Penguins that Margery Allingham wrote during wartime (it was a sudden interest) and, like the blitz-zones of London, Coventry, etc, they cracked at the spines, shedding pages, or clumps of them, as the reading progressed.

He’s also a Breton. So when he decided to leave his top ision team to join a small team based in Brittany for the 2018 season, most of his countrymen offered understanding Gallic nods. After all, cycling is in the blood of residents of this north-west region in France. Neighbouring Normandy isn’t far behind in its love of all things two-wheeled. And it’s little wonder – there are few areas better suited to exploration from the saddle.With hundreds of kilometres of voies vertes – greenways accessible only to those on two wheels, two feet, or a horse – there are plenty of options for families as well as Lycra-clad fanatics.Each of these routes is easily accessible from Cherbourg, Le Havre or Caen. So grab your bike, hop on the ferry, and get ready for some truly memorable cycling adventures.Cherbourg to Querqueville and back (nine miles14.5km)Best for: families looking for a safe and easy route to peddle.Highlights: stunning views out to sea.Start near La Cité de la Mer – Cherbourg’s maritime museum and well worth a visit – and take the cycle path alongside Boulevard de La Saline towards Querqueville. Enjoy the beach, and then head back the way you came.Ouistreham to Caen (10 miles16km)Best for: those who want to get on their bikes as soon as they get off the ferry.Highlights: the Musée Mémorial Pegasus commemorating the British soldiers of the 6th Airborne Division. Their capture of a bridge over the canal was a crucial strategic victory during the Normandy landings.This path is entirely along a signposted greenway, from Caen’s ferry port into the city itself, and will only take an hour or two to cover. It forms the opening portion of La Vélo Francette cycle route, which runs to La Rochelle.Caen to Bayeux via Juno beach and Arromanches (28.5 miles46km)Best for: the more confident cyclist, as much of the route is along shared roads.Highlights: arromanches 360° circular cinema, which tells the story of the Battle of Normandy.From Caen, take the cycle path north to Langrune-sur-Mer. Then head west along the coast towards Courseulles-sur-Mer, home to Juno beach on which Canadian forces landed during D-Day – a museum there commemorates their heroism. Then it’s the D112B south towards Crépon, then north towards Arromanches. From there, take the D87 to Bayeux – home to the famed 70 metre-long Bayeux Tapestry, and only seven miles away.Cherbourg to Carentan (34 miles55km)Best for: cyclists who are growing in confidence.Highlights: the wildlife-filled marshlands of the Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin.This is an established and well-signposted route, with no shortage of history along the way. It takes in the medieval cobbled town of La Haye-du-Puits and the châteaux ruins of Brix and Bricquebec.Ouistreham to Domfront (62 miles100km)Best for: confident cyclists, thanks to some steep sections.Highlights: the gorges of the Orne Valle, which offer multiple photo opportunities.This is the first full section of La Vélo Francette and offers its share of undulating terrain. From Caen it’s on to Thury-Harcourt, then the riverside village of Pont-d’Ouilly, Flers – home to a very pretty château – and finally on to historic Domfront, with its 11th-century castle.La Véloroute du Littoral de la Côte d’Albâtre: Le Havre to Le Tréport (about 100miles160km)Highlights: the stunning coastal views.This route follows the Alabaster Coast, with glorious views rewarding those confident enough to take on its undulations. It passes through Étretat – which provided inspiration for impressionist painters including Claude Monet – as well as Fécamp, home to a Benedictine abbey and a useful option for an overnight stay.Tour de Manche: Cherbourg to Roscoff (440miles708km)Best for: experienced riders who want a multi-stage adventure.Highlights: Mont St-Michel, Parc naturel regional des Marais du Cotentin et du Bessin and the waterfalls in Mortain are all glorious.You may not quite be ready for the Tour de France, but how about the Tour de Manche, a cycling adventure that links France and England? This 754mile1200km circular route includes parts of Dorset and Devon, or try the French section running from Cherbourg to Roscoff. It is split into stages – Cherbourg to Carentan is the first portion, and uses quiet roads and greenways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ac75f457503a87ad7074e8eaa2c2e0d74cb972c/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9005c36c281f0bd3f1514afc1e902cd","title":"the best food and where to find it in normandy and brittany","story":"Famed for their cider, cheese, seafood and charcuterie, Normandy and Brittany are two of France’s premier food regions. Foodies read on …MarketsAcross France, Normandy is esteemed for its abundance of quality produce and rich gastronomic history. Dozens of traditional markets showcase the best of these, with further specialist markets dedicated to fish, organic produce and local crafts. Whatever the day of the week, wherever you happen to be, you’ll never be far from one.Perhaps the most picturesque of these is to be found in the medieval “halles” in Dives-sur-Mer on a Monday. You can wander around the 14th-century half-timbered building, which is packed to bursting with stalls, and chat to dozens of local producers. Sundays in Trouville-sur-Mer are equally popular with locals and visitors looking for top-notch fresh bread, cheeses, meat and charcuterie – local farmers lay out their vegetables and homemade preserves, vinegar and pickles, too.In the surrounds of glamorous Deauville, regular gourmet food markets take place at Place du Marché (Tuesday, Friday, Saturday) and the abundant high-end restaurants and Parisian-style cafes are ripe for celeb-spotting during Deauville’s American film festival in September. If poisson is your passion, Trouville, the adjacent 17th-century port town, boasts a daily market on the quay with numerous terrace cafes and grills for feasting on seafood.Rouen and the Seine valley are renowned for the quality of their markets. For cheeses, fish and seafood, and local specialities such as pressed duck, check out Clos Saint-Marc (Saturday), Vieux-Marché (Sun-Fri and brocante or flea market on Saturday) and les Emmurées (Tuesday, Saturday) and the 250-stall Sotteville-les-Rouen (Thursday, Sunday).Regional specialities and where to sample themDairy herds were introduced to Normandy by the Vikings and the region has long produced world-class cheeses for the Paris market. You can buy camembert, Livarot, Pont-l’Evêque and Neufchâtel in shops and supermarkets, but to try small-batch artisan cheeses, head for the markets and specialist fromageries – notably in the Pays d’Auge and smaller Le Pays de Bray regions. At Isigny sur Mer, west of Caen, you can also enjoy a tour and tasting at Sainte Mére cheese factory.As you’d expect, the coastal towns and villages are awash with fabulous fish and seafood. Inland, look out for exceptional beef and veal, and the duck – canard de Rouen – appears on lots of menus.If you’ve a sweet tooth, don’t visit the region without trying a traditional tarte Normande, a rich shortcrust pastry tart filled with creamy egg custard and almonds, and topped with slices of caramelised apple. RestaurantsSmart, family-friendly eateries serving simple, seasonal produce are plentiful in Normandy. For fresh “surf and turf” with a sensational sea view, Hôtel des Isles in Barneville-Carteret, just south of Cherbourg, offers a land and sea starter buffet with seafood platters, grilled or plancha-seared fish and traditional stewed meats for main.If you’re after a traditional experience inland, try Brasserie Paul in Rouen where fresh regional specialities such as rabbit pâté, Normandy snails, local farm chicken and fine cheeses are on the menu.Rouen also offers stylish two-Michelin-starred dining at Gill – pigeon is a speciality – or the more affordable but still sleekly decorated sister restaurant, Gill Côté Bistro.DrinkingCalvados (apple brandies) and cider are the region’s two signature drinks. Three controlled appellations produce the former, one of which is Pays d’Auge, where copper alembic pot stills are used. On the 25-mile (40km) cider route east of Caen, you can visit more than 20 establishments producing one or both of these, as well as pommeau – made by mixing apple juice with brandy. Many of the distilleries and cidermakers occupy picture-postcard houses set amid apple orchards and lush pastures.MarketsFrom the bustling Sunday market at Carnac to Vannes’s fish market (four days a week, as well as a traditional market on Wednesdays) to the astonishing 20 neighbourhood markets that are spread around Rennes, Brittany is a region brimming with food and produce, crafts and culture. Whether you’re looking for crisp apples and freshly picked strawberries or more gastro items such as rare poultry and artisanal butters, you’ll find them on a stall – Breton chefs do their shopping here … and they know a thing or two.At charming Pontivy, by the river Blavet and the Nantes-to-Brest canal, you can drop in at the Monday market before exploring the medieval castle and the maze of winding streets. The town also has a thriving antiques trade and there are regular flea markets.Quaint Bécherel, between Saint-Malo and Rennes, has a buzzing Saturday food and household goods market and is also one of France’s best-loved book towns. There are more than a dozen bookshops, a book market on the first Sunday of the month and a lively schedule of literary events, including a fête du livre (book fair) every Easter.In the summer months, you can find night markets in Carnac and Quiberon, and enjoy classic Breton musical entertainment with bombarde (woodwind) players while you browse.Regional specialities and where to sample themIf you’re self-catering in Brittany you’re in luck. With 1,740 miles of coastline, you can pick up some of the best fish and shellfish in Europe. Brittany is the powerhouse of France’s oyster trade, providing one-third of the nation’s yield – Cancale is its capital. Look out, too, for delicious mussels, scallops, clams, lobster, and langoustines, as well as more exotic items such as organic abalones.Breton producers are very proud of their pork – saucissons of all kinds abound, while audouille – a sausage made from smoked chitterling – has its semi-official capital in Guéméné-sur-Scorff. Across the region, look out for local onions and organic honey.If you’re big on pastry, kouign amann – which translates as “butter cake” – is a Breton speciality. Created in 1860 in the town of Douarnenez, this gooey, layered confection is sold by weight in traditional patisseries the very definition of “naughty but nice”.RestaurantsIf ever you’re in need of a tasty snack between meals, a regional comfort food is the crepe, both the sweet kind and savoury galettes. They are served in restaurants and occasionally on the street. At the Creperie Ti Saozon, in Roscoff, chef Estelle Combot prepares sublime crepes with fish, as well as dessert crepes that get even the locals queuing around brunchtime.Seafood restaurants dot the coast. La Côte, close to Carnac’s famous menhirs, occupies a large, old house in a delightful setting, with a terrace overlooking a carp-filled pond. Try the squid with pig’s trotters or the lobster.L’Amphytrion in Lorient has two Michelin stars and a chic ambience. Acclaimed chef Jean-Paul Abadie creates fine art with spider crab, mackerel, sea urchins and local fish such as red mullet.DrinkingCider is the “wine” of Brittany. Cornouaille was the first French cider to be recognised with an appellation controlee label. Look out for the 10 AOC cider-makers and six non-AOC producers listed on the CIDREF website. Le Sistrot in Quimper stocks a wide range of craft and farm ciders.There’s also a long tradition of beer brewing in the region. Brasserie Lancelot was founded in 1990 and occupies the site of a gold mine in Roc-Saint-André, Morbihan. Seven unpasteurised beers are made here, each one named after a figure from Breton history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3075585869bb90cf569a4388fc10348b872f59ce/147_84_1757_1053/master/1757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aef9c696483c33cb068bf32dfd126ead","title":"statue margaret thatcher cue vandals","story":"Place an obstacle in the path and many people will seek to overcome it. Urban planners build footpaths, pedestrians forge their own desire lines. Hanging a “Do not climb” plaque is often a psychological incentive for people to clamber on to the forbidden edifice. This aspect of human nature should have occurred to the people behind the proposed installation of an enormous Margaret Thatcher statue in her home town, Grantham, in Lincolnshire. In order to prevent the statue being besieged by vandals, it will have to stand atop a three-metre (10ft) plinth.Creative critics of Thatcher’s legacy have already proposed workarounds: paintball target practice, hammer-throwing competitions, and the simple but trusty ladder. The depth of antipathy to the former prime minister means no matter what is built in her honour, it will draw vandals and dissenters. Knowing in advance that a statue commemorating her is likely to be defaced immediately, it is mystifying to insist on erecting it at all. Thatcher’s legacy remains with us today, and is still comfortably within living memory: that history, therefore, is still contested and fought over. Her fans and critics are embroiled in a battle to have their perspective recognised and recorded in history’s narrative.The inevitable vandalism will accurately reflect a toxic political legacy: the UK has long been cleaved by a social and class ide. Traditionally, the Conservatives have represented the interests of the ruling class and elite, and Labour the working class and more vulnerable. That two camps have such ergent views on the leader of one party is hardly a surprise. It is very likely that a statue of Tony Blair would also be immediately emblazoned with a spray-painted reference to war crimes for his role in the Iraq war. Freedom of expression isn’t always entirely polite, because feelings and emotions run deep, especially when people’s communities, livelihoods and loved ones have been jeopardised or harmed by the policies of these iniduals and their parties. Some councils operate a 10-year rule, to allow “passions to cool” before erecting a statue. Nonetheless, just this Monday Karl Marx’s memorial in Highgate cemetery was found vandalised.Perhaps statues have had their day. London in particular seems haunted by dark, metal figures of long-dead men, most with deep involvement in the bloody British colonial project, high-up roles in short wars, or simply the great fortune to be born into wealthy families. What do they teach us about history? Practically nothing. Barely anyone searches the background of a statue commemorating some man they’ve never heard of. These shadowy figures exist mostly to maintain the dominance of an inidual’s memory posthumously, or are erected in exchange for sizable bequests.Public sentiment around statues appears to be shifting. In 2018 a statue of Thatcher was rejected by Westminster council, despite being fitted with a hard-to-climb plinth and integral sockets for scaffolding to protect it during protests. The #RhodesMustFall movements in South Africa and Oxford, in the UK, forced some uncomfortable conversations about the degree to which colonial history is embedded in the architectural landscape of many institutions. Even when statues are not politically sensitive, they are not always welcome additions to the cultural landscape. The flat-out ridicule levelled at one of Cristiano Ronaldo, and another of Victoria Wood, shows the perils of trying to honour people in such a form: commemoration via statue can be high risk when capturing a likeness is the only point of the metal lump.Statues are only one way to tell us about history, and not even a good one. Murals, plaques marking important events, and public photographic exhibitions are more informative. History deserves to be in the public space and debated in the public realm. Growing up, I learned much about local history from murals commemorating the Chartist uprising and immediate murderous suppression of protestors in Newport, and a huge amount from almost every gable wall in Belfast. A statue of a prime minister has never taught me anything, bar the fact that too many of these people looked the same.If statues continue to play a part in public life, expect the public to engage with them, and not always with respect. In parliament, a bust of Oliver Cromwell was recently fitted with sensors after one or more MPs constantly turned it to face the wall in retaliation for his actions in Ireland. If Thatcher is hoisted atop a 10ft plinth, expect her to receive similar treatment. The will to vandalise her likeness is as much a part of the contestation of history as the right to leave her a bouquet of flowers.• Dawn Foster is a  columnist who writes on politics, social affairs and economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd453665de51381ba0da8b57a8a972803ff43237/0_91_5195_3118/master/5195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003b536eabaa29066fda7b1eb8b59a98","title":"the guardian view on brexit and ireland the forging of folly","story":"Brexit is about drawing lines on maps and hearts. In that respect it is at odds with the 1998 Good Friday agreement which sought to erase them. Key to ending the Troubles was the removal of the hard border between the north and south of Ireland. Theresa May’s problem is that she has committed to leaving the European Union while respecting the peace deal that depended on both London and Dublin being part of it. The agreement made less salient the questions of identity: under its provisions people in Northern Ireland could be, uncontroversially, citizens of Britain or Ireland. What did it matter if they were part of a club that allowed people to travel, work and reside anywhere? North-south institutions were set up to oversee common endeavours. The agreement was sold as a “stepping stone to a united Ireland” to republicans, while unionists held that it was “securing the union”. The symbolism was key: with a hard border you can see that the island is partitioned, without it you cannot.Aware of this, London and Dublin committed not to return to the days of border checkpoints, which would risk undermining the peace deal’s principles. Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement enshrines this in law in the form of an insurance policy: to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal, there would be a backstop arrangement to allow for frictionless trade. Fanatical rightwing anti-EU Tory MPs were not bothered about the peace process, or the aspirations of fellow subjects. Instead, they saw in the insurance policy a devious mechanism to force Britain to march in lockstep with EU regulations that hard Brexiters were desperate to get out of. To reverse her government’s historic Commons defeat, Mrs May voted to replace the backstop. She did so to win over the Democratic Unionist party, but her actions enraged businesses in Northern Ireland which had publicly backed her deal.In Belfast on Tuesday, the prime minister was back to the push-me-pull-you politics of Brexit. She signalled that, rather than the “alternative arrangements” to the backstop floated previously, she was edging towards an insurance policy that could either be time-limited or allow for a unilateral withdrawal. The prime minister may have said more than she intended, as a group of her MPs considering “alternative arrangements” were meeting in London as she spoke. Neither of Mrs May’s offers seem possible in a strictly legal sense, but both could be rendered in political terms. Almost everyone agrees that the backstop must be a temporary measure, but no one wants to say so in law. On such anvils, political follies can be forged. Mrs May’s problem stems from the fact that the only Northern Ireland party represented in the Commons is the DUP. The party’s role in itself undermines a core principle of the Good Friday agreement, that the position of the British government would be “neutral” – it had no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland and would accept the unification of Ireland by consent. The DUP-Conservative pact, a result of the 2017 election, calls this aspect into question. The DUP represents only a third of Northern Irish votes cast in 2017.• This article was amended on 6 February 2019 to change “The DUP represents only a third of votes cast in 2017” to “The DUP represents only a third of Northern Irish votes cast in 2017”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ade12fa2343560ae1185a2330a254d50f83018/0_18_5070_3044/master/5070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b74b4dbfe34d1a188ad03961d05b967","title":"eu far right steve bannon citizen debates","story":"The story of my life is, in some ways, the story of Europe. My father emigrated from Egypt to France in 1986, one month before I was born. My French mother fulfilled her dreams of becoming an English teacher after having grown up in the Calais region looking at the cliffs of Dover. Together they worked hard to give their children a bright future in a free, borderless, united Europe. I grew up with this dream, which has partly become a reality. But I’m not sure my own children will get to enjoy the privileges of belonging to the EU in the same way – if at all.So I decided to go on a debating tour of France, to better understand what makes us still believe in the strengths of the EU, as well as the fears some people have. I quit my job in Brussels at the European parliament to travel to small towns and villages in 30 of France’s départements and take part in discussions with local people about Europe, immigration, Brexit and Frexit. I’ve now held more than 60 such debates, ahead of the EU-wide elections due in May. Here are some of the lessons I’d like to share, and which must surely hold true elsewhere in Europe too.I once found myself listening to an angry man telling me how “African and Arab immigrants can’t integrate”.All the while, I thought of my Arab, Muslim, immigrant father who wakes up every day before I do, works six days a week saving children’s lives as a doctor, his accent an endearing reminder of Egypt. I sat there and listened to the man’s concerns and then respectfully confronted his arguments with facts such as there is no connection between race and crime. But the truth is, I was lucky enough that he’d shared his views in the first place. This at least allowed for a genuine exchange of ideas, and it made him feel listened to.Bridging the gap between EU institutions and citizens requires better work at a grassroots level. I know from working in the European parliament, at the heart of Europe’s democracy, how worried most people are about the rise of xenophobia and Euroscepticism, and how hesitant they are about addressing this head-on. But travelling to reach out to voters can contribute to shifting their mindsets. Shunning that effort and keeping to the “Brussels bubble” is a huge mistake because it allows the far right to monopolise public discourse, or set its terms.After David Cameron called for a referendum on EU membership, the Scottish MEP for whom I then worked, Alyn Smith, switched from his parliamentary work to travel across Scotland, listening and speaking to people from all backgrounds in dozens of events about the benefits of belonging to the EU. There has to be more of this kind of outreach across the continent.The European parliament has direct, tangible effects on our lives. It can weigh on financial markets, on climate change, on the tech giants. It is relevant in so many positive ways – not a hotbed of bureaucrats. Discussing its role with people in local communities can shift perceptions. During a debate in the region of Savoie, in the French Alps, one lady told me she had no interest whatsoever in the EU elections. I mentioned Europe’s role in defending minority and women rights, and it meant a lot to me that she left the meeting saying she’d cast a vote for her “children’s future”. Likewise, in discussions with supporters of the gilets jaunes movement, I saw how making the case for citizens’ empowerment could actually convince people to vote in the EU elections, not just stand in the cold at roundabouts complaining about “elites”.At the heart of the European project is an endeavour to build a better future for us all. If Islamophobia is on the rise, we should fight it with just as much energy as we do antisemitism, and vice versa. Indifference is a recipe for collective failure. If you’re a citizen of an EU country, get involved. Call your MEP, write a petition, support a citizens’ initiative, join a party or an NGO you believe in. Engage with your community, especially in the face of hardship. After the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, I organised a gathering around a group of Syrian refugee musicians who’d arrived in Europe on rafts. Together we founded Syrians Got Talent, who have since given 19 concerts across Europe. We were disparaged by Breitbart News, the far-right website set up by Donald Trump’s then presidential campaign strategist, Steve Bannon. We just went on, building trust between locals and refugees.The fight for a united and strong EU is a worthwhile one. Debating with people in small localities throughout France has reminded me – and hopefully others – that the power of the European project lies in its citizens, in transcending national borders so that we can live together. Now is the time to stand up to the anti-EU push Bannon has launched. This May, for the first time in its history, the European parliament risks becoming a fulcrum for the far right. The significance of this should not be underestimated.• Schams El Ghoneimi is a French-Egyptian pro-EU activist based in Paris he has worked for the European parliament and founded Syrians Got Talent, a Syrian refugee musical group"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b542e7713dcec1dad1aa276f1f130813cfb156/0_0_941_574/master/941.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c31321fe3d1a773afff203425b8477eb 465w","title":"skin deep why alexandria ocasio cortezs beauty regime split the internet","story":"Last week, towards the end of her first month in office, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted a five-page Instagram story on her skin routine and it split the internet.It wasn’t the use of retinol that sent critics into a spin. Ocasio-Cortez’s double cleansetonermoisturisesunscreenvitamin Cdo-not-sleep-in-your-makeup, six-step regime is not exactly anomalous for a 29-year-old woman with an income. Nor is it a surprise that a woman working in the public eye washes. After all, we live in a world in which communication is visual and where a woman in lipstick in a political space will still turn heads. (AOC should know: in June, during the New York primary campaign, she tweeted the shade of her Stila lipstick and there were similar repercussions.)What seemed to pique her detractors’ rage was that in spite of a record number of women serving in Congress, and in spite of AOC being a woman who took a man’s seat, the politician had dared to admit a base level of vanity. And she wore sunscreen. In contrast, last week, the New York Times finally rumbled Donald Trump for allegedly wearing fake tan and “a little powder which the president applies himself before television appearances” and no one batted an eyelid.But what the congresswoman’s post shows is how in the past two years the concept of skincare has changed beyond all recognition. Where once we were told to cleanse, tone and moisturise (and later discouraged from over-exfoliating), the kind of multi-step Korean-influenced beauty routine that Ocasio-Cortez subscribes to has taken on near-religious power. In fact, AOC’s “face layering” regime looks positively spartan in comparison to the laborious regime of about 10 different steps adopted by some women in South Korea and Japan. The industry exploded globally a couple of years ago, but it has already moved from novelty to backlash (last January, the Outline described it as “a con”, while in October women in South Korea destroyed their makeup as part of a movement called “escape the corset”). AOC’s endorsement simply shows it has gone mainstream, appearing as a regular topic in the New Yorker and Atlantic, well outside of the beauty blog bubble.Along the way it has also normalised some pretty weird vernacular, from snail slime and donkey masks to “mules” (people who are paid to bring things back from abroad) and “dupes” (products that mimic expensive products for half the price). And then there’s the money. Newish companies that specialise in multi-step products such as The Ordinary and Drunk Elephant have successfully rebranded “anti-ageing” products as “millennial” ones, and in turn, sent revenues hurtling towards the billions. According to Kotra, the South Korean government agency for trade promotion, $4,536,943 (£3.47m) worth of K-beauty products were legally exported to the US in 2018, up almost a million on the previous year. Who knows how much comes through more nefarious channels. Multi-step beauty is not simply an arm of the industry, it is its own economy.For many of us, the idea of AOC double cleansing is both fascinating and reassuring. Fascinating because in dark political times, there are few better balms than reading about the routine of a politician, and reassuring because it proves that AOC is one of us. Lisa Niven-Phillips, the beauty editor of Vogue, saw her endorsement as pivotal to her success as a politician: “The thing with AOC is that she doesn’t think it’s too trivial to talk about, which is honest – and promotes the idea that people can be multifaceted. I love the transparency that’s how she got millennials on board, isn’t it?”Niven-Phillips came across the regime in Seoul six years ago and has since upped her skincare count to six steps. Like AOC, she double cleanses (a thick one to take off makeup, less thick to actually wash) uses a vitamin C serum, a hydrating serum, a little moisturiser and, twice a week, an exfoliant. If going to a party, she uses a sheet mask: “They’re good for immediacy, rather than any long-term benefits,” she adds. And, for anyone asking, the whole thing takes five minutes, and means she wears less makeup as a result. “That was always the idea – to improve your skin first so you didn’t need to then cover it in makeup.”Anita Bhagwandas, the former beauty editor of Stylist, agrees. She has seven or eight steps – including the double cleanse – and more in the winter. “I always thought the multi-step regime was a myth,” she says. “Now it seems perfectly normal. I don’t know why there is so much fuss and mystery surrounding it.” The whole thing takes less than 10 minutes, and she, too, wears less makeup as a result. “The natural skin look on Instagram has definitely replaced the contouring one.”In truth, it is not solely about creams and oils. Skincare has always been about putting money on your face, but while a lot of it is probably snake oil and a financial drain, it is no coincidence “face layering” has risen in popularity with self-care, another catch-all phrase which has been buzzing around over the past few years. Its meaning has become amorphous – we now think of it as me-time, or candles in the bath – but it was originally a medical concept applied to mental and emotional health. At a certain point, it even became a political act, reclaiming health and wellness from the white patriarchy who kept it to themselves. The African American writer Audre Lorde described it in 1988 as “not self-indulgence” but “self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare”. That AOC is a woman, a millennial and also a socialist, has arguably redirected self-care back in that direction.So maybe it is no coincidence that self-care mushroomed in the wake of the US election and the EU referendum. According to Slate, in 2016 Americans Googled the word self-care twice as often as they ever had before. Skincare and self-care are not the same – but there is an overlap. Niven-Phillips, Bhagwandas and I can all vouch for that. Layering six creams is clearly about cocooning your skin, but also yourself. The beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton, a follower of the multi-step regime whose Google doc of routine products led to her becoming a contributor to New York magazine, agrees. “I’m always taken aback by the assumption that skincare is something that’s in service to a person other than yourself.”So whether a 10-step regime actually works is besides the point. “I don’t think skincare needs to be excessively complicated with a large number of steps, nor do I think it needs to be expensive,” says Dr Anjali Mahto, a consultant dermatologist. Sure, there is some science to it “and we can all benefit from the basics of cleansing and moisturising, but many of the ingredients in high-street or drug-store skincare products are exactly the same as in luxury brands”. Her own routine includes the famous double cleanse – “I remove the day and all of my makeup with a micellar water, followed by an AHABHA foaming cleanser” – but she agrees it is as much about “the whole experience – choosing the product, its smell, texture, packaging and feeling of wellbeing it can create (even if it’s for a short period of time)”.In many ways, skincare in 2019 is not solely about vanity and the reversal of time. It is also about female anxiety and the pressure to care but pretend you don’t. While perfect skin does not exist, the pursuit of it does and for some women, talking about that can be empowering. As Naomi Wolf outlines in The Beauty Myth, “women can tend to resent each other if they look too ‘good’ and dismiss one another if they look too ‘bad’”. As AOC can attest, you’re damned if you double cleanse and lazy if you don’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e985ab8a9b9ea96b782b5f8bd0426319fb9afa66/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7bd32302dbd74cceeeb4e9cc1447c95","title":"spot on how to wear leopard print to work if youre a man","story":"Keith Richards and Richey Edwards may have made animal print look effortless - but how does it translate to the daily grind? Two  writers find outIs there a time and place for men to wear leopard print? I have always thought so – and that time and place is if you are Richey Edwards in the Manic Street Preachers circa 1993. Outside of that context, leopard print is intimidating. It is a statement of the kind most men get self-conscious about. Yes, it looks great on Keith Richards, but it also looks faintly ridiculous when you are mooching around the tea point at the .There were, inevitably, some funny looks when I wore it for a day at work. But was that the print? Or because I was wearing a blousey number with half my chest on show in the middle of winter? It’s hard to say. But after half an hour, I started to relax into it. And then I noticed all the women in the office effortlessly wearing their animal-print skirts, scarves and dresses. Surely us guys should get to enjoy it, too, without freaking out?I decide that I would definitely give leopard print another go. I could imagine wearing it as a coat lining, or on a slightly more suitably tailored shirt … maybe even on a luxurious sweater. It might be a little while before I treat my colleagues to a second look, though. Tim JonzeThere was a moment in January, about halfway through the Versace menswear show, when a model emerged in a larger-than-life leopard-print coat complete with a coordinating hairdo. Yes, that’s right. Leopard hair. Later, on her Instagram feed, Donatella Versace posted a shot of herself and said model with the caption “the hair-coat match was everything”.Despite many of the recent autumn shows being tales of sedate elegance where suits were front and centre, animal patterns, in particular leopard, offered a necessary bite. Raf Simons showed an almost floor-length coat of leopard in a ballroom in Paris. At Marni, leopard appeared on loosely shaped trousers as coats, trims, hats and shirt hems peeked out from beneath knitted layers. Hedi Slimane’s debut men’s collection for Celine also included a leopard coat, while a selection of footwear featured this splashy pattern.As someone who has never entertained leopard, and pretty much lives in jeans, it threw me.Of course, the idea of men wearing leopard print is not unheard of. But, like many things in men’s fashion that deviate from the conservative, it still has the potential to raise eyebrows. Yes, we have all seen Rod Stewart, Brian Eno and Bryan Ferry working leopard print, while images by Jesse Frohman of Kurt Cobain in a leopard coat, jeans, trapper hat and white sunglasses prove that leopard and denim are excellent bedfellows. But still ...Regardless of what you think, it’s happening. At Asos, there are 143 items listed (you will need to mentally prepare yourself for the sight of leopard briefs). Zara’s classic leopard shirt would work over a white T-shirt or under a grey V-neck knit, untucked, a tad grungy. Or perhaps a muted leopard Our Legacy cardigan, thrown over a denim shirt, is another easy way in. See also All Saints, known for indie lead-singer tendencies, whose animal-print offerings include a simple leopard T-shirt.I am definitely intrigued. And I definitely want to try that Simons coat on with some urgency. Whether that means I am sold remains to be seen. But if the likes of Timothée Chalamet and Michael B Jordan can wear designer harnesses on the red carpet, why not leopard print? Roll on Oscar night. Chalamet in Raf Simons leopard? Oh, go on then.

Yasmin Khan’s new cookbook, Zaitoun: Recipes From the Palestinian Kitchen, begins by transporting the reader to the Tel Aviv airport interrogation rooms where Khan, a Briton of Iranian-Pakistani heritage, was questioned for several hours after flying into Israel.“I just decided I needed to tell the truth,” Khan says about her cookbook’s introduction. “I thought it was important for me to start the book with that because we do live in context while Israeli food is booming, this other side isn’t represented.”Zaitoun, which was published yesterday in the US, is the newest of a recent crop of Palestinian cookbooks attempting to remedy that, including the London-based Palestinian chef Joudie Kalla’s 2016 Palestine on a Plate and The Palestinian Table, a 2017 volume from Reem Kassis, a Philadelphia-based Palestinian cookbook author. It reads as much as the story of the Palestinian people as their food, interweaving the anecdotes of home cooks and professional chefs with more than 80 recipes.The book’s chapters are organized by course, interspersed with stories about Palestinian culture. In the first chapter, Khan explores mezze, the vivid, often plant-based dishes associated with the Galilee it includes three recipes for hummus, a rich shakshuka, various flatbreads, and a salad that teams salty halloumi with orange, dates and pomegranate seeds. From the West Bank, Khan showcases gutsy stews, breads, and meat dishes influenced by both Bedouin and Jordanian cooking the main courses chapter includes a recipe for mussakhan, a concoction of roast chicken seasoned with sumac and served with caramelized onions over taboon flatbread, one of the national dishes of Palestine. The food of Gaza, which Khan couldn’t visit due to the blockade that cuts it off from the rest of Palestine, is meanwhile bright with fresh dill, green chilies and garlic, all of which find happy expression in a spicy shrimp and tomato stew recipe.But for all of its vibrancy, Gazan food is also in danger of extinction: the blockade, as Khan writes, has plunged the region into food poverty and is eradicating its once-thriving fishing industry.Writing about Gazan cooking was just one of the challenges specific to writing about food in a place of conflict it is impossible to talk about Palestinian cuisine, Khan learned, without acknowledging the effects of the Israeli occupation. As one woman angrily told her: “We are not clowns in a circus for you to come and watch and make research notes about and then make your name from writing down our suffering.”“It was just really hard,” Khan, 37, says of figuring out how to strike a balance between depicting Palestinian food and the realities informing it. “I had this idea of, OK, I’m going to go write a cookbook and describe the situation, but it had been five years since I’d been and had forgotten the intensity and the trauma.”After her first research trip in 2016, Khan came back “completely unsure if I could do the book”, she admits with the thoughtful candor that characterizes her writing. “I didn’t know how I could accurately represent the really painful situations I’d witnessed. Writing a cookbook felt so trite.”But not long into the almost year-and-a-half-long process of researching and writing Zaitoun, Khan realized that she could use the book as a window into what she had seen. “I felt it was quite important to include these challenging voices,” she says. “It was very important to me to have Palestinians in their own voices sharing how their lives are, but it was challenging.”Khan covered similarly daunting territory with her first cookbook, The Saffron Tales. Published in 2016, it is a vibrant compilation of recipes and stories from another widely misunderstood place: Iran, the country where Khan’s mother grew up and many of her relatives still live. “I came to realize after the success of The Saffron Tales that there was a powerful role that food could play in exploring countries in the Middle East,” Khan says. “And I also think I stepped into more what I think is now my mission of challenging stereotypes of the Middle East.”It’s a mission that Khan has on some level been preparing for her entire life. Born in London, she was just three months old when her mother, who was working on her PhD in nutrition, took her to Iran to conduct field research. Then the Iran-Iraq war happened, and the borders closed. She and her mother stayed in Iran for a few years, before reuniting with her father in the UK. The family settled in Birmingham when Khan was six.At various points during the eight-year war, Khan returned to Iran with her mother despite the tumult there. “It was a very intense time, but we kept going back,” she says. She had close family members who were jailed or executed, and remembers sneaking snacks to her imprisoned uncle on Nowruz and then milking cows on her grandparents’ rice farm.“A psychologist probably wouldn’t take much to realize that my childhood, and seeing the backdrop of Iran and the horrors unfolding there led me to do a law degree with a view to being a human rights lawyer,” Khan says with a laugh. She became a human rights campaigner for a decade, eventually succumbing to career fatigue in 2013. As she pondered what to do next, she got the idea to write what would become The Saffron Tales, funding her first research trip to Iran through a successful Kickstarter campaign. “There was a huge gap in the market for Iranian cookbooks,” she says. “But more than that, there were no nuanced depictions of Iran other than what you’d see in the news.”As The Saffron Tales earned critical acclaim, Khan quickly came upon the idea for her follow-up. During her last few years in the non-profit sector, she had traveled throughout Israel and the West Bank as part of her NGO work on Israeli-Palestinian relations – “It probably caused my burnout,” she says wryly. But the food and flavors were familiar to her, and Khan saw an opportunity to explore another place that, like Iran, “is often narrowly seen through a political prism”.Khan’s heritage and human rights work have earned her the respect of a number of Palestinian chefs, many of whom have had to endure their share of stereotypes, even as they have watched attitudes towards Palestinians begin to shift over the years. In 1998, when Rawia Bishara opened Tanoreen, her Middle Eastern restaurant in Brooklyn, “there was this overwhelming idea that all Palestinians are terrorists and they carry the guns”, says Bishara, who immigrated to the US from Nazareth in 1974. When she told her early customers she was from Palestine, many of them thought she was from Pakistan. “Every time I said ‘Palestine’, they said, ‘Pakistan’,” she recalls.“I think talking about the conflict is not a bad thing,” Assil says of Khan’s decision to juxtapose it with beautiful photos of delicious food. “When you talk about the conflict you talk about the resilience of people. I’m speaking as a Palestinian now – when we talk about any subject related to our culture or upbringing, for better or worse the war and all these things are so normalized.”Khan, she adds, “is going in there and keeping people’s memories fresh and alive, and talking about the origin and evolution of the food is part of that. We don’t have to shy away from politics. As a reader, you’re partaking in that by buying the book and cooking that food.”Khan herself has been pleasantly surprised by the book’s reception in the UK, just as she was by The Saffron Tale’s. “A few people have written saying they’ve been moved to tears by the book, which I think is unusual for a cookbook,” she says. “That’s one of the things I’m most proud of.”Last September, Khan posted photos to Instagram from another place shaped by conflict: a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. When asked if her visit had anything to do with an upcoming project, she demurs. “I can’t really talk about my next book publicly yet, but you can take from that what you want,” she says. “But I think going forward I’m really committed to continuing to do what I can to use the power of story and cookery to shine a light on places of conflict.”Serves 4 as part of a spread8oz (250g) halloumi cheese1 orange1 tbsp  olive oil or any neutral oil (optional)2oz (50g) medjool dates, pitted and finely sliced2 tbsp  pomegranate seeds2 tbsp  extra virgin olive oil1 tbsp  unsweetened pomegranate molassesSmall handful of mint leaves, finely choppedSlice the halloumi into 14 in, 1cm-thick slices.Remove the segments from the orange: slice the top and bottom off the fruit, cutting deep enough that you see a wheel of orange flesh on both sides.

But having seen his players progress all the way from beating their fellow National League side Braintree Town in the fourth qualifying round back in October to beating Sheffield United in round three, Currie could still afford to smile at the final whistle after a spirited performance from his team that could easily have yielded another shock.“They’re disappointed but when we look at it in a few days they will realise what they have achieved,” said the former midfielder. “If we had got our goal at 2-0 it could have been a different story. But I’m immensely proud of how they performed.”After a brilliant free kick from Dan Sparkes had forced a replay in front of a record crowd at the Hive two weekends ago, Barnet were attempting to go further in this competition than they have ever been against a side who are more than 70 places above them in the league pyramid.In protest against Brentford’s decision to only allow 1,600 visiting supporters – 300 fewer than the maximum permitted – Kleanthous watched the game in the club bar nine miles away because he “didn’t feel comfortable sitting with the prawn sandwich brigade” when so many fans had missed out on such an important occasion.With swathes of red seats in the main stand remaining unoccupied as the match kicked off, it seemed a shame a compromise couldn’t have been reached by two sides who also share a nickname. Yet the group of supporters stationed behind Barnet’s goalkeeper, Mark Cousins, for the first half more than made up for it in terms of atmosphere.Even the opening goal after seven minutes from Sergi Canós didn’t seem to dampen their enthusiasm, with the Spaniard confidently tucking home Benrahma’s cutback following an innovative corner routine for his third goal in as many matches.Brentford have been revitalised in recent weeks under the head coach Thomas Franks, having not lost in 10 matches since mid-December – a run that has lifted them well away from the bottom three in the Championship. A talented side packed with players who are comfortable on the ball, they will move to a new 17,250-capacity stadium up the road at the end of next season and could be real contenders to reach the top flight for the first time since before the second world war if they continue their upward trajectory. The only issue for their chairman Matthew Benham will be retaining his best players, with Chris Mepham having become the latest to leave last month for Bournemouth.Neal Maupay – the former France Under-21 who ended up in west London after a spell at Saint-Etienne – could be the next to fly the nest, while Algeria international Benrahma, a fellow graduate from Nice’s academy, also looks good enough to play at a higher level.His pinpoint delivery from a free-kick allowed Julian Jeanvier to volley home the second and it suddenly felt a long way back for Currie’s team. But if Brentford thought their opponents would simply roll over in the second half, they were mistaken. Within two minutes of the restart, a near 22-man brawl ensued that threatened to spill into the stands after Barnet’s Medy Elito slid in recklessly on Canós before falling to the ground when his opponent squared up to him.Both escaped with bookings but the bad feeling lingered throughout the second half. Sparkes came off the bench to curl a free kick just over from almost the same position as his equaliser in the first match before Craig Robson’s header struck the woodwork from a free-kick.Another flowing move eventually saw Maupay score his 20th goal of the season to put the tie beyond Barnet before David Tutonda’s consolation ensured their supporters could make the short journey home with their heads held high. “It’s 30 years since we have been in a quarter-final so it would be nice to do that again,” said Franks. Playing like this, Brentford will be a match for anyone.Second-half goals from Nahki Wells and Matt Smith proved the difference as QPR made it through to the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time in 22 years with a 2-0 win at the expense of Portsmouth at Loftus Road.In a quiet first period, Darnell Furlong’s header against the bar from Luke Freeman’s centre was the pick of the chances. Extra time looked a distinct possibility heading into the break, but Wells, QPR’s top-scorer, broke the deadlock with 20 minutes left, capitalising on chaos at a corner to bundle in from a yard out.The result was then made safe seven minutes later as the talismanic Freeman delivered a sumptuous free-kick which Smith powered home to set up a home tie against Watford on 15 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/388243441ab552556e558a21bf8c0f27e123243d/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcc0e0e1424546e88b26d7cc1c215a32","title":"the joy of six football title run ins","story":"A full-tilt Liverpool charge, Napoli’s epic collapse, missing boots, broken Hearts and Cantona’s economical brilliance featureHooliganism, Heysel and the Bradford fire had left English football on the brink of oblivion in 1985. On-field action desperately needed to take centre stage again and Ron Atkinson’s Manchester United came waltzing out from behind the curtain to hog the spotlight, winning 10 on the bounce and opening up a 13-point lead over runaway reigning champions, Everton. “It’s all yours, Ron!” screamed one headline in November. It was a leap to imagine that by April “Atkinson Out” banners would be on display at Old Trafford after a side light on physicality crumbled, losing 10 games.With Gary Lineker on his way to scoring 40 goals in a season, Everton found their groove and by the end of February they were three clear of United and eight ahead of transitional Liverpool, who they beat 2-0 at Anfield. But Liverpool went berserk after that loss, winning 10 from 11 in a full-tilt title charge before the finale. Everton, meanwhile, were left cursing the mysterious disappearance of their striker’s footwear in a 1-0 defeat at Oxford on 30 April. “I had a pair of lucky boots … they weren’t in the skip that night,” Lineker said in 2008. “I don’t know why. I wore a new pair and had one or two half-chances which went begging.” West Ham and Everton both stayed in contention until the last day, when they played each other at Goodison, but Kenny Dalglish’s solitary goal at Chelsea made Everton’s 3-1 win meaningless. To add salt to the Toffees’ wounds, Liverpool sealed the Double against them in the FA Cup.The 85-86 season in Scotland wasn’t half bad either with Celtic, Hearts, Dundee United and Aberdeen involved in a rollicking finish. Hearts were surprise guests in the lead group, mind, having been 200-1 outsiders and losing five of their first eight. But with Craig Levein a rock at the back and John Robertson firing up front, Alex MacDonald’s side set off on an astonishing seven-month unbeaten run. Tynecastle was buzzing. Hearts hadn’t won the league since 1960. Like Leicester in 2015, they were the neutrals’ favourite and passed each test along the way too, beating all three title rivals in their backyards.With rotation still years away, Hearts were blowing bubbles as they rounded the final bend with a 1-0 home win over bottom-of-the-table Clydebank. But despite Celtic having gone on a seven-match winning run, a draw at Dundee would end Hearts’ 26-year wait for the title. The problem was, the squad had been hit by a virus, Levein was missing, and they had little left in the tank. It was 0-0 at half-time and Hearts still had a loose grip on the pot. But news filtered through on the radio that Celtic were 4-0 up against St Mirren, meaning that if Hearts conceded, the title would go to Parkhead on goal difference. Hearts held their nerve at Dens Park until the 83rd minute. Then up popped Albert Kidd, the substitute striker who had not scored all season, with a stab of the boot that was a dagger to the Hearts. The cruel Kidd did it again six minutes later too. Hearts are still broken to this day.When José Mourinho guided Real Madrid to 92 points in his first season only to finish second, he must have wondered what he had gotten himself into. With Inter he had proven he had the beating of Barcelona on the one-off occasion, but staying the distance with Pep Guardiola’s relentlessly brilliant side was another thing altogether. So, while the Treble with Inter is understandably held up as his crowning achievement, the solitary league title he won at Madrid should be right up there alongside it. Madrid had won 15 games on the spin and were top going into the first clásico at the Bernabéu. They were played off the park in a 3-1 defeat. Brilliant Barça were now level on points. Did Mourinho’s players still feel inferior? Perhaps, but he didn’t. Where others saw his team as being tactically and technically lacking against one of the greatest ever club sides, he saw only misfortune. “No one can see it was anything other than luck,” he mused.Madrid went off on a Cristiano Ronaldo-inspired dazzling run, setting a new standard for relentless excellence in Spain. They did not lose again in La Liga before the second clásico 18 games later. And they did not lose there either, the king of the stepover, Ronaldo, stepping around Victor Valdés to seal a 2-1 victory. Four wins later Mourinho’s side were crowned champions on a record 100 points, having scored a record 121 goals, 71 of which came in their last 23 games.Alan Hansen’s “you won’t win anything with kids” line and Kevin Keegan’s “I will love it if we beat them!” rant are two enduring memories from this pulsating season. Keegan’s tirade is still viewed millions of times over as a meme to signify a meltdown. But Eric Cantona’s solitary goals in 1-0 wins for Manchester United just as accurately explain why the momentum in the title race so thrillingly switched from Tyneside to Manchester. On 20 January 1996 Peter Beardsley lashed home a volley to secure a 2-1 win over Bolton and take Newcastle 12 points clear of United. A day later Cantona, who had recently returned from his nine-month ban for impersonating Bruce Lee, lashed the ball past West Ham’s Ludek Miklosko to kickstart United’s chase. Solitary goals by Cantona won five games during the season by the beginning of April previously swashbuckling Newcastle were ragged and rattled after Cantona did the 1-0 trick three times in little over a month, including an incredibly damaging result at St James’s Park on 4 March that closed the gap to one point.The race now resembled the T-1000 chasing the Anthill mob. That 4-3 defeat at Anfield left Newcastle psychologically jiggered and five days later they lost at champions Blackburn, who had been rubbish for most of the season. And even though United suffered a grey shirt-inspired wobble in a 3-1 defeat at Southampton, Cantona’s economical brilliance ensured Newcastle were shot by the time Keegan started yelping into the microphone at Elland Road. The “Entertainers” finished the season unable to entertain, drawing their final two games 1-1 while ruthlessly efficient United walloped Nottingham Forest 5-0 and Middlesbrough 3-0. Cantona did his 1-0 act once more to good effect, securing the Double against Liverpool at Wembley.Napoli’s extraordinary meltdown to hand the title they won the previous season to Milan is still the source of much debate. Did dark forces have a hand in it? Diego Maradona’s having none of it and sums it up succinctly – and entertainingly – in his autobiography:Michael Thomas at Anfield in 1989 Andy Cole’s miss at West Ham in 1995 Bayern-Schalke and those four minutes in May 2001 Agüeroooooooooo for Manchester City in 2012 all wonderful examples of last-day drama but here’s a frantic finish you might not know about. Fifteen years ago, in Norway, fingernails were chewed in their thousands. Rosenborg had won the title 12 seasons in a row but Valerenga had got themselves back in the race with a 4-1 away win against the champions and kept pace until the final day. With both teams on 45 points and +15 goal difference, Rosenborg faced Lyn and Valerenga played Stabæk, both winnable home matches.A game of nerve-shredding title-tennis ensued as Valerenga led 1-0 before Rosenborg scored twice and then conceded. But Frode Johnsen popped up for the champions to give them a 3-1 lead – and the virtual title again – in the 70th minute before Valerenga’s Erik Hagen and Daniel Fredheim Holm scored in the 81st and 83rd minutes. They led 3-0. The bunting was being readied in Oslo … until Johnsen struck in the 89th minute to level the goal difference at +18. Crucially, though, Rosenborg had scored 12 more than the pretenders to their throne. The game ended in Trondheim but Rosenberg’s players could not yet toast another success – they had to huddle around a pitch-side screen to watch events in Oslo, where there were six minutes to play. They stared, mouths agape, as Valerenga’s Morten Berre went clean through, but the winger fluffed his lines and sidefooted the ball straight at Stabæk keeper Jon Knudsen. Cue bedlam at Rosenberg, who were champions again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fcdb570bd0a5fa785354a127e45c2d821542da6/0_140_5320_3192/master/5320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d2ffc10fe80ec6bc4d05502ba01034d","title":"what are the lowest xg scoring football matches in history expected goals the knowledge football","story":"Plus: repeated penalty awards, keepers kissing the post and lengthy absences. Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“I noticed the expected goals score for Cardiff v Huddersfield was 0.12 v 0.39. Is it the lowest-xG-scoring game ever?” asks Phil Dodds. “Is 0.12 the lowest inidual xG recorded?”“0.12 wasn’t even the lowest xG score recorded in that round of games,” writes Paul Fulcher (look here for an explanation of xG). “Wolves clocked up a score of 0.10 just two days later in their 3-0 (or in xG terms 3.12-0.10) defeat against Manchester City. Burnley managed 0.11 in September’s win at Cardiff when Burnley actually scored twice.”Laurie Shaw picks up the baton. “Looking through the major European leagues since 2014-15, La Liga holds the record. On 23 May 2015 (the last day of the season) Granada v Atlético Madrid finished 0.08 v 0.07 in xG (and 0-0 in actual goals, unsurprisingly). There were only five shots in the game, and just one on target. For the second part of the question, several teams have managed to register exactly 0 xG in a match, including at least one Premier League team. Swansea City failed to manage a single shot on goal in their league match last season at Huddersfield.”Was it a long-range chance or an absolute sitter?Did the player have just the keeper to beat?Was it a cross, a long ball, a through-ball, a cut-back?Was it a tight angle or did the player have both sides of the goal to aim at?Did the chance fall at the player\u0027s feet or was it a header?This helps determine whether the player would have been under pressureThis helps determine how prepared the player would be before taking the shotThere’s more, as Andrew Beasley explains. “It’s hard to have a definitive answer on this, as different xG models give out different scores,” he explains. “However, FiveThirtyEight have a spreadsheet you can download with more than 10,000 matches on it, so that’s the best place to start. They have Cardiff v Huddersfield as 0.16 v 0.47. There have been 25 matches with a total of lower than 0.63, but only seven lower than 0.51 as per the original question. The lowest they have is 0.33: Temperley v San Martín de San Juan in the Argentinian Primera Division in November 2017. The home side won 1-0, and despite scoring in the fourth minute, the visitors seemingly couldn’t offer up much of a response.“They also have plenty of examples of an inidual team having less than 0.12 xG – 24 home teams and 106 away sides have managed it. According to their data, there have been six teams that had 0 shots, so obviously 0 xG.”“Have there been any recorded instances of a penalty being awarded straight after a penalty is saved?” asks Danny Treanor.Yes, Danny. “Go in to five minutes in this video and you will find two penalties for Dunfermline within about 10 seconds of each other against Ayr United in 2016,” mails Kenny McLeod. “Both for Kallum Higginbotham … and both saved.” It finished 1-1.There is also the case of Heurelho Gomes during Tottenham’s 1-1 draw against Blackpool in 2011. Paul Doyle takes up the story:The Brazilian seemed to have gone a small way towards atoning for the many costly mistakes that he has committed this season by performing a superb save from a Charlie Adam penalty in the 75th minute. However, he immediately negated that feat.When Blackpool sent the ball back into the area less than a minute after his save, the keeper failed to cut out the cross and then barged into Gary Taylor-Fletcher while giddily attempting to retrieve the ball. ‘Everybody lost their cool when we saved the penalty and everyone got too excited,’ Harry Redknapp said. DJ Campbell tried to persuade Adam to relinquish spot-kick duty but the Scot stepped up and sent Gomes the wrong way.And Douglas Jones recalls the Championship meeting between Scunthorpe and Middlesbrough in August 2009. “Joe Murphy saved a penalty from Adam Johnson, only to foul Johnson as both were attempting to reach the loose ball,” he mails. “Johnson scored from the resulting second penalty.”“I swear I remember a story about Gianluca Pagliuca kissing a post after someone hit it in a penalty shootout,” tweets GTPLiquid. “Am I dreaming?

Indeed, Overmars had played his last professional game on 30 June 2004 before returning to action with Go Ahead Eagles in their game against Fortuna Sittard on 15 August 2008: an absence of three years, 10 months and 15 days.However, Michael Haughey could top Mr Topping. “I would guess the longest time out of the first team would be those players who careers ned either side of the second world war,” he mailed. “From September 1939 till the resumption of FA Cup matches in the 1945-46 season or even longer if their demob was held up until 1947.”• For thousands more questions and answers look through our archive.“Tottenham have currently played 29 consecutive Premier League games without drawing one,” notes Wouter van Dael. “What is the longest ever such league run?”“Allan Nyom spent six years on loan from Udinese at Granada between 2009 and 2015,” writes Jonathan Gallagher. “I know that both clubs had the same owners, but surely that must be the longest loan spell in history?

Ag McKeith, whose daughter May is among the defendants, said she had not slept until 4am because of her own worry about the prospect of her daughter being sent to jail.Dozens of supporters packed the court before proceedings began, with so many wanting to attend that a list of names had to be drawn up to ensure that family members were guaranteed seats.Liberty, the human rights organisation, wrote to Morgan on Tuesday, urging him to “carefully consider issues of proportionality” when deciding on the sentences.“It will come as no surprise to the court that Liberty supports and campaigns for the right to peaceful protest,” the letter, signed by Corey Stoughton, Liberty’s acting director, said.“Where protesters break the law, but do not commit violent acts, we suggest care should be taken in order to ensure that their rights at common law and under articles 10 and 11 or the European convention on human rights (ECHR) are not breached.”Article 10 of the ECHR guarantees freedom of expression, including peaceful protests and demonstrations, while article 11 covers freedom of assembly and freedom of association.Stoughton said: “The excessive charges brought in this case were an attack on the right to protest that threatens activists, campaigners and anyone who cares about the need for dissent.“Whatever the judge decides, this case has already broken our long tradition of honouring and respecting peaceful protest and civil disobedience as necessary tools for defending our values and challenging abuses of power.”Most of those due to be flown on the Stansted flight have since been removed from the country, however 11 remain, with two granted leave to remain and one a resident’s card. Eight have ongoing cases with the Home Office, according to End Deportations, the activist group to which the Stansted 15 belong.A spokesman for End Deportations said: “Whatever the sentences handed down by Judge Christopher Morgan, the terror convictions have profound implications for the lives of the Stansted 15, severely restricting their ability to work, travel and take part in everyday life.“The convictions themselves are the first use of controversial terror legislation passed in the aftermath of the Lockerbie bombing against peaceful protesters and, whatever happens with the sentencing, they have profound implications for the right to peaceful protest in the UK, and for democracy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012c0f604a9b73c7eb06d18ed1f74f2f3527b604/0_3368_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c3d5761975cdaf8d7f36de6542b5ea","title":"pope francis offered 1m charity donation to go vegan for lent","story":"Campaign targets pope because of his environmental leadership and influence over 1.2bn CatholicsEnvironmental campaigners have issued a challenge to Pope Francis: go vegan for Lent and receive $1m for the charity of his choice.The purpose of the Million Dollar Vegan campaign, led by 12-year-old Genesis Butler, is to encourage people to eat less meat and dairy in order to fight climate change. Global warming cannot be beaten without huge cuts in meat eating in rich nations, research shows, while reducing consumption of animal products also tackles pollution and the destruction of forests and wildlife.Butler, from Long Beach, California, has been vegan since the age of six and has staged many protests against animal cruelty. She said there were many reasons for eating a plant-based diet.“There is an animal side, a health side and an environmental side,” she told the . “If I tell people about the damage that the animal agriculture industry is doing to the planet, then some of them want to go vegan. I also tell them about health and how when you go vegan it can help prevent cancer, heart, disease and diabetes, or how animals have to die or suffer.”The campaign is backed by celebrities including Paul McCartney, the actor Mena Suvari, the musician Moby and naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham. Young environmental protesters are becoming increasingly high profile, with Greta Thunberg’s school strikes for climate inspiring tens of thousands of other students to follow suit.In her message to Pope Francis, Butler says: “In your encyclical letter, Laudato si’, you stated that every effort to protect and improve our world will involve changes in lifestyle, production, and consumption. I agree with all my heart and seek your support in tackling one of the largest underlying causes of the problems we face: animal agriculture.”Matthew Glover, CEO of Million Dollar Vegan and who co-founded the Veganuary campaign, said the Pope had been selected for his environmental leadership and influence, particularly in South America, where great forests continue to be cut down.“We are launching this deliberately bold, audacious campaign to jolt our world leaders from their complacency,” Glover said. “We are thankful that Pope Francis has spoken out and that is why we are humbly asking him to try vegan for Lent, and set an example of how each of us can align our principles of caring and compassion with our actions.”The $1m has been donated by the Blue Horizon International Foundation, the charitable arm of the Blue Horizon Corporation, which invests in companies producing plant-based foods and aims to “accelerate the removal of animals from the global food chain”.Lent is a period of about 40 days that ends just before Easter and during which many Christians practise abstinence of some kind. It reflects the Bible story of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert and in 2019 runs from 6 March to 18 April. The Vatican had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.Daniel Hale, at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “Pope Francis has been the standout world leader on climate change this decade. Like all Christians, the Holy Father will make his own choices about how to give, act and pray this Lent.“It’s a period of reflection for all Catholics and a chance for us to respond to the Pope’s call for us to live a simpler and more sustainable lifestyle in various ways,” he said. “For some, that will mean cutting down on meat, while others are switching to renewable energy or campaigning for action to reduce emissions.”Butler’s activism began early. “When I was about to turn four I asked my mom about where we got our chicken nuggets from, because I would always eat them,” she said. “I was devastated. I told her that I never wanted to eat meat again. But I still love chicken nuggets – the vegan version – and I love vegan mac’n’cheese.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cc8c29d02110128fea6ca3d6b431ecf690d78c4/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83a38a3ff546c81eb7e16c70d062617","title":"chinese lunar new year 2019 in pictures","story":"To welcome the year of the pig more than a billion people across the world have begun celebrating.

That’s what I’m assuming, but I haven’t fixed a date,” the broadcaster told the Daily Mail. He said he had previously believed he would carry on doing the job “either until they threw me out or had enough of me, or that I’d got bored of it or stopped enjoying it, but none of those things have happened”.He added: “I still enjoy it enormously. I know that sounds ridiculous. There are mornings in mid-February when you don’t want to get up at half past three. But, equally, there are other things I want to do with my life, and one has to make the decision sooner or later.”The presenter’s supposedly imminent retirement has been the subject of media speculation for more than a decade. Much of this has been stoked by Humphrys himself, who would give interviews predicting his own departure before going on to sign a contract extension.This time it appears he really is on the way to the exit, with the Today programme editor, Sarah Sands, saying: “Enjoy John’s lap of honour this year. Totally uninterested in his own publicity. A king of broadcasting.”If the 75-year-old does depart after almost a third a of century with the same programme then it would end a high-profile and often controversial stint on the airwaves, during which he shaped the reporting of British politics. His aggressive interview style on the programme won both fans and detractors, with his political stance coming under particular scrutiny following the Brexit referendum.Humphrys, who as a young journalist reported on the 1966 Aberfan mining disaster, later joined the BBC where he worked as a foreign correspondent before becoming lead presenter on the Nine O’Clock News. He then transferred to the Today programme in 1987, where he has covered the administrations of six different prime ministers for the Radio 4 show.In recent years, he has been writing a book on his times with the programme entitled The Today Files, and could find it hard to promote the inside story of the programme while still appearing on the airwaves.Last year, he was at the centre of an equal pay row after a recording leaked of him making off-air comments about the BBC’s gender pay gap, following the resignation of the BBC China editor, Carrie Gracie, in protest at inequality at the corporation.BBC pay disclosure figures revealed that in 2017 Humphrys received between £600,000 and £649,999 from the corporation for his work on the Today programme and presenting the quiz show Mastermind. Following an outcry he agreed to take a substantial pay cut, with his combined salary set to fall below £300,000 by next year.The pay disclosure caused ructions within the Today presenters, with Humphrys’ longtime colleague Sarah Montague leaving the programme after discovering she was paid substantially less than her on-air colleagues.Humphrys’ departure would open up a presenting slot on the programme alongside fellow hosts Nick Robinson, Mishal Husain, Martha Kearney, and Justin Webb. The appointment could be one of the first decisions for the new Radio 4 controller.Sands has previously described Humphrys as a “listeners’ champion”, and said “he will know when it feels right” to leave.“He’s extremely curious, he’s extremely engaged, fantastically interested in new subjects and new people and real people. The overall purpose in him is pursuit of truth,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb003449974c2bea9e293fbc994304171a9b5f3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb692b4f53b33461372df03017561f32","title":"pop 2 0 how globalised music created a new kind of star","story":"English is no longer the lingua franca of pop music, and its alpha stars – Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga – are an endangered speciesHere were two acts who had vaulted western pop’s language barrier: BTS are currently the world’s biggest boyband Ozuna sings and raps, tackles reggaeton, bachata, Latin trap and plain old pop with equal ease, and was YouTube’s most streamed artist in the world in 2018. Numbers two and three in YouTube’s list were J Balvin and Bad Bunny, two more singer-rappers who primarily perform in Spanish. And, incidentally, eight of the 10 most viewed songs of 2018 were by Spanish-speaking acts.What Caramanica noticed was a fundamental change to the idea that English is pop’s lingua franca. This development has been accompanied by a remarkable shift in the pop-star system itself. While bilingual artists surge into charts and playlists, joining the American rappers who have profoundly reshaped popular music in the last 20 years (the five most listened-to tracks on Spotify in 2018 were by US hip-hop acts), it’s a different story for the stars who emerged during the era we might call Pop 1.0. “The massive pop stars of yesteryear – Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake – are fading from the public consciousness,” wrote New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich in a review of a Taylor Swift concert film, premiered by Netflix on New Year’s Eve.Though the review is broadly sympathetic toward Swift, Petrusich suggests that despite the singer’s continuing immense popularity as a live act, she’s pushing an aesthetic that is outdated. Moreover, Petrusich seems to imply, so are the other superstars – Perry, Justin Bieber, Britney Spears, Madonna – who stage similarly alpha tours.These “massive pop stars of yesteryear” adhere to a model established in the early 80s. The industry infrastructure – radio, MTV, record shops, press, awards ceremonies – created an unprecedented level of fame for the top artists, especially the trinity of Madonna, Prince and Michael Jackson. They were the unassailable pantechnicons around whom the idea of pop stardom revolved, establishing the template for Mariah Carey, Timberlake, Spears and Jennifer Lopez – right up to today’s Perry, Swift, Bieber and Lady Gaga. The latter might be the final Pop 1.0 star to have owned the zeitgeist while at her peak, and it says much about her prescience today that she has dissociated from the aloof figure she cut in her imperial phase.The music was vocally driven, melody prevailing over beats, verses almost always leading to choruses. It could be pensive or euphoric it might toy with exotica or exhibit social awareness it was open to advances in technology (Carey’s wholly traditional-sounding All I Want for Christmas Is You, for instance, was made entirely with computers – sleigh bells and all). The main thing, whether it was a frothy Madonna bop, an oily Prince sex romp or Gaga making like a shard of Auto-Tuned ice, was that the artist’s presence was all over it. You knew who you were listening to: the song was in the service of the singer – not, as is often the case today with fluid genres such as trap, the other way around.As we approach the end of the decade, streaming, which skews heavily toward hip-hop, is the most popular way of hearing music. The average 12-year-old has never known genre boundaries and is likely to be listening to everyone from Cardi B to BTS to platinum-selling American singer Becky G, who has only returned to singing in English after three years of exclusively Spanish releases. Against that, the once omnipresent 1.0 acts represent a mindset that feels outmoded. A bit hubristic and mainly white, that mentality is battling the fluidity of the new guard. Led by rappers and global acts, the 2.0 cohort are oblivious to genre rules: they pop up on each other’s records, singing in Spanish or Korean or French, and they speak directly to fans via social media. Balvin, Drake, BTS and fellow K-pop hunks Monsta X, Cardi B, the currently ubiquitous Post Malone, Bad Bunny – all have their own styles, yet are adaptable they’re enormously popular, but by the rules of the old music business, ungovernable. The old riot grrrl slogan, “This is happening without your permission”, feels apt.While they’re as ambitious as any old-guard star (“we want everybody to love the album, even though they don’t understand what I’m saying,” Balvin said (in English) last year), they’re achieving their aims by being relatable. To audiences whose entry-level pop star was Cardi B or Drake, artists are supposed to be relatable, and to meet them halfway by exposing their lives on Instagram and putting out new music as it’s ready rather than sticking to rigid release schedules. The artificial starfan distinctions that made Madonna and Jackson feel unreachable no longer exist.Non-anglophone artists can thrive in this ecosystem. I’ve seen it for myself: in 2018, I reviewed London shows by Balvin, pop-reggaeton golden boy Maluma, Monsta X and BTS. The venues heaved with excited young Londoners, who sang along, lofted flags and generally did their nut over being in the same room as their heroes – all of which is par for the course at pop shows. What was different was that almost none of the songs were in English, and most of the fans couldn’t understand the lyrics. And here was the thing: that was absolutely fine, posing no barrier to loving the music. If anything captured this remarkable new order, it was my friend’s BTS-stanning 14-year-old daughter, who spent the show singing every song. After discovering the group via social media a couple of years earlier, she decided to learn Korean and had now mastered enough to understand the songs. Having a grasp of the language is also useful for following K-pop bands on social media, where fresh content is uploaded hourly, much of it solely in Korean.The more switched-on 1.0 stars have been clambering over each other to collaborate with the 2.0s: Bieber shoehorned his way on to the Despacito remix (though the Luis Fonsi-Daddy Yankee original is vastly more popular on YouTube, with 6bn streams compared to the Bieber version’s 600m). Perry got trap superstars Migos aboard her current album and Lopez collaborated with Bad Bunny on her 2018 single Te Guste. And you can bet that Madonna’s new album, due this year, will acknowledge 2.0.Spare a thought for the old guard. How could traditional pop superstars not feel they were singularly special when they’ve spent their careers being treated like emperors? Each new album or tour was the subject of a campaign planned a year in advance, and no promotional gesture was too grandiose. Jackson, to name one glorious example, set out on his 1996 HIStory tour with a nine-metre statue of himself. On the first date, in Prague, it was displayed on a plinth formerly occupied by the Stalin monument.Compare that to Drake, arguably the Jacko of today in terms of stature and influence: his 2016 single One Dance arrived without an official video and still spent 10 weeks at the top of the US chart, and 15 weeks at No 1 in the UK. Meanwhile, ever since Beyoncé’s surprise 2013 LP, rap and R\u0026ampB artists have turned the album-release playbook on its head by putting out albums whenever they decide it’s time, even if it means doing so with no warning other than a few judicious leaks. The “surprise” release is now so common that it’s becoming less useful as a strategy, but maybe that doesn’t matter: whenever an album emerges, fans will come, or they won’t.The 1.0 stars often outperform the newer ones on the live circuit, where the hubbub about streaming figures and globalism means relatively little. Swift’s 2018 tour was the second highest grossing in the US last year, taking $315m. First place went to her friend Ed Sheeran, on $429m. It’s worth noting that Sheeran is unusual in having staked places in both the 1.0 and 2.0 camps. His traditional songcraft marks him as old school, but long-term alliances with rappers and Afrobeat stars such as Fuse ODG suggest that he could survive any 1.0 clearout.But the live industry might as well be another galaxy: included in 2018’s 10 top grossers are country singer Kenny Chesney, the Rolling Stones and a Journey-Def Leppard double-header, none of whom stream particularly well or pretend to be any cooler than they are. A flourishing gig market is one of the only reliable holdovers from the golden past. Artists have taken advantage of this market by bundling a copy of their new album with every ticket – not as an inducement to buy tickets, which will be snapped up regardless, but to help their new album achieve a better chart position.So which of the “massive stars of yesteryear” will stick it out? Most likely, it will be the adaptable ones – artists who don’t just piggyback on to prevailing styles but have an affinity with them. Sheeran is probably safe, as is Grande, whose move toward trap and R\u0026ampB has been seamless and convincing. The sense that the 1.0 era is over is solidified by the lack of superstars-in-waiting. Bebe Rexha, Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello and Dua Lipa, as fine as their efforts might be, aren’t cut from the same lordly cloth as their forebears. The cultural environment in which they find themselves militates against pop gods – just imagine if Michael Jackson had turned up with that statue now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f84e733526d67ba0ae91daa75d92f76e25032c/0_153_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a383a839d61adf38b632ac036a5c4c50","title":"is climate change way worse than we realise today in focus podcast","story":"David Wallace-Wells, the author of new book The Uninhabitable Earth, depicts a world ravaged by climate chaos.

Donald Tusk. Both Tusk and Juncker have been adamant that the withdrawal agreement will not be reopened.Number 10 sources suggested they did not expect a warm reception, but that it would signal the start of a new diplomatic process, involving proposals on the backstop worked on by MPs and ministers.Earlier on Tuesday, May told her cabinet she would not countenance any delay to the UK’s exit on 29 March, a message to ministers such as Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid who have suggested at least some delay might now be inevitable. Ministers who are more pessimistic about the prospects of the UK leaving on time with a deal held their tongues in the meeting after May’s warning.“She was pretty clear she had no time for anyone calling for it to be extended,” one cabinet source said.However, senior government sources increasingly believe the impasse may not be resolved until March, given no full EU council summit is due until late that month. That may ultimately become an excuse, some believe, for the prime minister to delay the UK’s exit in order to finalise any compromise.In cabinet, ministers including Amber Rudd and Michael Gove are understood to have underlined how they did not believe the UK public had fully comprehended the severe damage no deal would do.May did not set out explicitly to her cabinet the changes she would seek when she meets EU leaders.However, speaking in Belfast, May said she knew there were anxieties in Northern Ireland about replacing the backstop arrangement and said there would always be an insurance option to prevent a hard border contained within the withdrawal agreement.“I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future,” she said.“There is no suggestion that we are not going to ensure that in the future there is provision for this – it has been called an insurance policy, the backstop – that ensures that if the future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, there will be arrangements in place to ensure that we deliver no hard border.”Earlier in her speech, May also sounded a note of caution about the alternative arrangements that some MPs have been working on to replace the backstop. She said a seamless border was “the cornerstone around which the community in Northern Ireland has come together to deliver peace and prosperity”.“I will not do anything to put that at risk,” she said. “So while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.”Tory MPs from a number of different Brexit factions are working on a proposal for alternative technological arrangements to the backstop, known as the Malthouse compromise after the housing minister, Kit Malthouse, who brought the groups together.Members of the European Research Group, which is made up of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, agreed to back a compromise amendment last week on changes to the backstop after assurances from May that it would mean reopening the withdrawal agreement.Downing Street would not say if work by the Brexit secretary Steve Barclay, who is working with Conservative backbenchers on the Malthouse compromise, would conclude by the end of Wednesday.The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, is also drawing up a proposal on legally binding limits to the backstop.At her speech in Belfast, May said she would never allow a hard border to be erected on the island of Ireland.“Northern Ireland does not have to rely on the Irish government or the European Union to prevent a return to borders of the past,” she said at a speech in Belfast. “The UK government will not let that happen. I will not let that happen.”May said she understood that the “prospect of changing the backstop and reopening the withdrawal agreement creates real anxiety” in Northern Ireland but it was necessary to get the deal through the Commons.The audience of Northern Ireland business owners and executives gave lukewarm applause to her speech. Several said they were frustrated that her plan to avoid a hard border and disruption to trade remained unclear.Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said he hoped a meeting with May after her speech would clarify how she intended to reconcile promises on the backstop with avoiding a hard border.“You’re talking about the disintegration of the supply chain. Northern Ireland is in the eye of the storm,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efa4ac3943ec0d6ebb1714f6486608c35012552c/624_63_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da9069481f7ea854a5946bee9b229811","title":"chris grayling not welcome in calais says ports chairman","story":"Jean-Marc Puissesseau reportedly accuses transport secretary of disrespectThe transport secretary, Chris Grayling, is no longer welcome in Calais, according to the port’s chairman, who has been angered by British plans to ert some sea traffic in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Jean-Marc Puissesseau reportedly accused the UK cabinet minister of behaving in a “completely disrespectful” manner on Tuesday.“It is not fair at all, it is completely disrespectful. I don’t want to see him again,” Puissesseau told the Daily .The UK government has awarded contracts to three firms as it seeks to bypass congestion it predicts will mount up in Calais as a result of extra customs checks, which ministers believe will need to be carried out following a no-deal Brexit.Without contingency plans, the government fears deliveries of food and medicine could be delayed.Puissesseau has previously insisted no such disruption is likely because Calais has been planning for a no-deal Brexit for a year. In January, he told the BBC: “It’s wrong, it’s not true that there will not be more delay … The only thing we will be asking of the driver is that they have their customs declarations, but we will not stop and ask more than we are doing today.”And, speaking to the  on Tuesday, he added: “We didn’t ask for Brexit, but we have spent the money for traffic to flow regularly.”Puissesseau has not been the only one to express displeasure at the UK government’s plans. Jacques Gounon, the chief executive of Eurotunnel’s parent company, has said the awarding of the ferry operator contracts was “distortionary and anti-competitive” and would be a “unilateral breach not only of the concession agreement with Eurotunnel, but more widely of existing competition and state aid law”.It has been reported that the government plans to pay a law firm £800,000 for advice in anticipation of a legal action brought by the company.Reacting to Puissesseau’s comments on Tuesday, the Labour MP and supporter of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, Virendra Sharma, said: “Surely this is peak Chris Grayling, only this time he’s gone international. All he needs to do now is release a statement blaming everyone else and his predictable path of chaos will be complete.”A Department for Transport spokesman said: “While the transport secretary strongly supports work across government with the EU to ensure a deal is reached, he will also continue to lead the DfT to ensure all contingencies are prepared for concerning Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/683b7869efba34d04aef91ee29206764542adc0e/0_388_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcad02b45a94fac5ff2018b87b9cd32b","title":"uk can avoid no deal brexit recession says economic forecaster","story":"Blow to economy could be softened with planning from government and EU, claims the NIESRBritain could avoid slumping into a recession in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit, according to one of Britain’s leading economics forecasters.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the blow to the economy from a disorderly departure from the EU could be softened by contingency plans being put in place by the government and by Brussels. Ministers could also reduce the impact with tax cuts and additional public spending, further limiting the damage.Britain’s oldest independent economics research institute – in forecasts likely to embolden Brexit supporters urging Theresa May to pursue a “managed no-deal” – said that economic growth would come close to zero in the first two years after a no-deal Brexit. However, it would avoid the recession that has been forecast by some experts.Although warning that every Brexit outcome would still be worse for the UK economy than remaining in the EU, it said there was sufficient headroom for the government to stabilise the economy in the short term.“Were the UK to exit the EU without a deal in March, we would expect a sharper slowdown in economic activity than in the central case,” NIESR said in a report published on Wednesday, adding: “How much the economy responds would depend on the extent to which policy steps in and eases the transition.”The report comes after the Bank of England warned that Britain could plunge straight into a recession worse than the one that immediately followed the financial crisis 10 years ago, a scenario which has been used by the prime minister as a warning to MPs to vote for her EU withdrawal agreement to avoid inflicting significant damage on the economy.While some measures have been proposed by both Britain and the EU to offset the impact of a no-deal scenario, many analysts warn that time is running out and that they may not be agreed upon in time.However, offering a possible route-map for a no-deal scenario, the NIESR analysis said that additional support could be put in place by ministers and the Bank of England to curb the short-term impact to the economy.Such interventions would, however, come with a cost. The NIESR report said unfurling such a package could add as much as £60bn to government borrowing by 2023-24. It also warned that inflation could accelerate, eroding real wages and acting as a brake on the economy in future.Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomics at NIESR, said: “All this is not to say there will not be long-term economic costs. Those costs remain intact. These are just mitigating measures.“Whilst it does make headlines or sensational news to suggest the economy will go into recession or not, I don’t think economists have the tools to be that precise. The big picture is I think there really will be a material slowdown,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd0475b90e9e6142d89a1e670a5fbc0158ac954d/777_11_3454_2072/master/3454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48ff016f7952e70192709610b3c8e21e","title":"brexit latest news developments pmqs theresa may faces further backlash after backstop comments in belfast speech politics live","story":"Comments come as David Lidington and Emily Thornberry deputise for party leaders at PMQsJim McMahon, the Labour MP, says the government has committed to setting up a fund to pay for children’s funeral. But it has not actually been set up yet. Thousans of families have had to pay for funerals since the announcement without help.Lidington says the government will stop parents having to pay for these funerals. But it is looking into how best this can be delivered. He says he will put McMahon’s point to the ministers in charge.Jack Brereton, a Conservative, commends the police and the fire service for their response to the fire in Stafford this week.Lidington says all MPs will feel enormous sympathy for the horror the family have suffered.PMQs - Snap verdict: That wasn’t a particularly memorable PMQs, but it was more focused and less shouty than the usual MayCorbyn encounter, and Emily Thornberry, who had the upper hand, will notch it up as a success. She is an accomplished despatch box performer and in the past, when standing it an PMQs, she has often played it for laughs. Today she started with with a very good joke, but after that stuck very firmly to policy, largely eschewing party political sloganising. Her tone was appropriate given the seriousness of the crisis facing the country and, although her questions did not elicit any new information, the response they got did illustrate the weaknesses in the the government’s stance. She also seemed to commit Labour to wanting a temporary extension of article 50 more firmly than any other frontbencher has, as far as I’m aware. She was probably right when she said that Lidington understands the minutiae of Brexit better than any of his colleagues (he was Europe minister for years, and also served a long stint as shadow Northern Ireland secretary). Lidington made some reasonable points about the flaws in Labour’s own Brexit policy, but at no point did he really go for the jugular. It meant that he never got off the defensive, but, on the plus side, his demeanour, too, matched the occasion. At least he was taking it all seriously.Thornberry says she would be happy to hold a seminar on the problems with May’s plan at another time. She says a customs union is the only viable solution. So why is the government so dead-set against it.Lidington says the Labour plan for a customs union would not fully address the border problems in Ireland. Thornberry has said she would be happy with a Norway option. But that would involve free movement. Does Thornberry support Norway, or the Labour manifesto, which ruled out free movement.Thornberry says Lidington probably understands these issues better than anyone else in government. But even he cannot give answers. She will give him one more chance is there a better plan than this, or will he let parliament take charge?Lidington says May will report back to parliament. The two-year deadline stems from EU legislation. And from article 50. Thornberry voted for article 50, he says. He says perhaps this was a vote where Thornberry was present but not involved. If Thornberry wants to avoid no deal, she should vote for a deal, he says.Thornberry says the sensible, cautious thing to do would be to seek a temporary extension of article 50.Lidington asks Thornberry to explain Labour policy.Thornberry says there is no way that the UK can avoid a border in Ireland after Brexit without a full customs union, or a backstop, or a technological solution. Which plan is the government pushing?Lidington says Labour wants a customs union, so businesses can export without tariffs or checks. But that is what the PM’s plan proposes. So what part of her deal does Labour object to?Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary who is standing in for Jeremy Corbyn, starts by saying it is good to be up against the person dubbed the effective deputy PM again. This must the the only time the words effective and prime minister appear in the same sentence.She asks when the vote on the deal will take place.Lidington says Theresa May said the meaningful vote would come back as soon as possible. If that does not happen by next Wednesday, there will be a debate and vote next Thursday.Thornberry says May said she would get a significant and legally-binding change to the withdrawal agreement. What will happen if towards 29 March that has not been achieved.Lidington says May is going to Brussels tomorrow.He says, if MPs want to avoid no deal, they must vote for a deal.Andrew Bridgen, the Tory Brexiter, starts by saying he was pleased to watch the video of Jeremy Corbyn condemning the EU when he was a backbencher. Will the government rule out a second referendum.Lidington says a second referendum would suggest the government got it wrong.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister who is standing in for Theresa May at PMQs, starts by welcoming the news that the Nato summit is coming to the UK in December.Here are the main points from Donald Tusk’s statement to journalists.People all over the continent, and in Ireland, hoped that the UK would change its mind about Brexit.Tusk said he too hoped the UK would decide to stay in the EU.But the facts are unmistakeable. At the moment the pro-Brexit stance of the UK prime minister, and the leader of the opposition, rules out this question.Today there is no political force, and no effective leadership, for remain.I say this without satisfaction, but you can’t argue with the facts.I hope that tomorrow we will hear from prime minister May a realistic suggestion on how to end the impasse in which the process of the orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU has found itself following the latest votes in the House of Commons.The EU is first and foremost a peace project,” he said. “We will not gamble with peace or put a sell-by date on reconciliation. This is why we insist on the backstop.Just in case anyone did not get the message, Donald Tusk, the European council president, has been tweeted.Tusk says he hopes Theresa May will come to Brussels with a “realistic suggestion” tomorrow.He says the withdrawal agreement is not open to renegotiation.He says the EU has been preparing for the “possible fiasco” that might happen if the UK leaves without a deal.And he ends by saying those who promoted Brexit without a plan for leaving deserve “a special place in hell”.Donald Tusk, president of the European council, is speaking in Brussels now.He says he would like the UK to remain in the EU. But Theresa May is committed to leave, he says. And he says there is no effective leadership for remain.He says the EU is preparing for a no-deal Brexit.Critics of Theresa May’s Brexit deal have published proposals for a future free trade agreement between the EU and UK which they claim will deliver the “most advanced and liberalising” conditions ever seen. As the Press Association reports, the document - part of a sequence of reports released under the slogan A Better Deal - proposes zero tariffs and no restrictions in quantity for trade in goods and agricultural and food products and “maximum liberalisation” for services. It proposes “state of the art” highly facilitated customs clearance arrangements between the EU and UK. On the movement of labour, it calls for easier access to temporary business visas, while on the movement of capital it proposes free flows between the EU and UK. The two sides would be barred from erecting technical barriers to trade or using standards as a means of making trade more difficult. And the two sides would have to commit not to use subsidies or state aid to distort markets. Written by international trade policy experts Shanker Singham and Robert MacLean, the document states that its proposals would preserve the UK’s ability to strike trade deals around the world and make changes to its own domestic relations, the Press Association reports.Speaking ahead of the report’s launch in Westminster this morning, Esther McVey, the Brexiter former work and pensions secretary, said:Brexit was about taking back control over our trade policy. Ninety per cent of global economic growth will come from outside the EU in the years ahead and the EU now accounts for less than half of the UK’s overall trade.So we must develop a trading relationship with the EU that makes doing business with our closest trading partners possible, without hindering our ability to develop new trading relationships with non-EU countries. This proposal paves the way to a better future and a more global Britain.The prime minister must introduce direct rule government for Northern Ireland if no Brexit deal can be agreed, the Ulster Unionist party has said. UUP leader Robin Swann made the call as he arrived to meet Theresa May at Stormont. He said:We are not far from March 29, we as a party don’t see a no deal as a positive situation or something that suits Northern Ireland or the UK.We have asked her to look for an extension of article 50. If she is not prepared to do that, and we are at a situation where the executive and the Assembly isn’t up and running again, she has to put something in place. She has to put direct rule in place come March 30 because Northern Ireland needs political leadership and it needs political direction. As the Press Associatoin reports, after his meeting, Swann claimed May appeared reluctant to talk about efforts to restore power sharing. He said:The conversation we were having with the prime minister was initially about Brexit, we had to drag her to a place were we actually started to talk about how we get these institutions back up and running.The Labour MP Chris Leslie asks Fox if he can say the government is ruling out removing all tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. A HuffPost story yesterday said this was being considered.Fox says the government has not decided what it’s policy would be in these circumstances.He says he personally has never advocated full liberalisation. But it would not just be a decision for him, he says. It would be a collective decision.Leslie suggests the people working in an industry like ceramics, which would suffer hugely if tariff reduction allowed in cheap ceramic imports, will be worried that Fox has not ruled out universal tariff reduction.Fox says this would be a collective decision. But he says the government is very aware of the harm a decision like that could cause.At the international trade committee Nigel Evans, a Tory Brexiter, asked Fox if he thought May was “wedded” to the backstop. The reports from yesterday’s speech implied she is, he said. But Evans said a lot of Brexiters “would just like to bin it”.Fox said it was important to differentiate between the concept and the mechanism. May was committed to the concept of ensuring that there will be no hard border in Ireland, Fox said. But she was not committed to a “particular mechanism” for achieving that.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has just started giving evidence to the Commons international trade committee.As the ’s Jack Maidment reports, Fox started by saying a Brexit deal was closer than ever.MPs proposing the so-called Malthouse compromise, which would offer the EU a choice of options to get round Conservative objections to the Irish backstop, have insisted Theresa May still takes their idea seriously, despite seeming to rule it out in a speech in Belfast on Tuesday.The idea, named after named after housing minister Kit Malthouse, groups together Tories from both Brexit wings of the party. It proposes to offer the EU two option. Plan A proposes an extended transition period which would remove the backstop in place of as-yet undetermined technological checks if this fails, plan B would also extend the transition arrangement to allow for a managed no deal.A series of supportive MPs have been meeting Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay this week as a so-called alternative arrangements working group.In her speech, May stressed that the UK could not leave the UK without a backstop, the insurance policy intended to avoid a hard Irish border if no permanent solution can be found.But one MP from the group said they felt this had been overblown:The thing about the PM is that, as ever, she’ll stick to the same line until something else is firmly on the table. What the working group is doing now is looking at the workability of what has been proposed. I strongly suspect she hasn’t had formal advice on that, so the words don’t preclude alternative arrangements. It’s a question of what those alternative arrangements are.Another MP from the group said they felt it was possible May could still present their idea to Brussels:We’ve had very good engagement from the government. We’ve had a series of working parties. I think the idea is that by the end of today there’s a sense of this being, hopefully, a realistic option that the prime minister can then consider as she looks for options to take to Europe.There is, however, not complete unity on the way forward. One MP from the group said they would be fine with the Malthouse plan being taken to Brussels as part of a “menu” of options, such as a change to the backstop, for example to time-limit it.But another argued that the entire backstop was “structurally wrong”, adding:So to accept it with a time limit, or some exit mechanism, whatever it might end up looking like, is still a very difficult thing to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69194dd7d10e86f0a1c2d48f365efef63c61a5a/299_604_3845_2308/master/3845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a02b3473bc0c33bff7f03d5c04775da","title":"judges reject bias claim jewish housing association agudas israel","story":"Agudas Israel within its rights because Orthodox Jews have different needs, court rulesA row about allocation of scarce housing could be heading for the court of appeal after judges rejected a claim that a housing association broke equality laws with its policy of providing homes only to Orthodox Jews.The Agudas Israel Housing Association, in Stamford Hill, east London, was accused by lawyers acting for a single mother of four of allowing Orthodox Jewish families to “jump the queue”.The woman, who is not being named and is not Jewish, had seen a property listed on Hackney council’s housing system which stated: “Consideration only to the Orthodox Jewish community.”The woman was near the top of the council’s housing priority system and had been living with her children, two of whom are autistic, in temporary accommodation for 16 months, because their previous home was ruled unsafe.Her solicitor, Rebekah Carrier, had claimed that the housing association’s policy “smacked of ‘no blacks, no dogs, no Irish’,” a reference to signs pinned up by some landlords decades ago.“It was quite shocking to see it being offered not on the basis of need but on the basis of religion,” Carrier said. Hackney has a social housing waiting list of around 13,000 households.But the mother’s application for judicial review of the policy was dismissed in the high court, which ruled that the charity is within its rights to take positive action in favour of Orthodox Jews because they have different needs – in terms of following a way of life that requires them to live close by each other – and are themselves disadvantaged, in terms of suffering antisemitism generally and in the housing market, and in terms of overcrowding rates in Stamford Hill, which are more than double the rest of the borough.Lord Justice Lindblom and Sir Kenneth Parker ruled in favour of the charity and cited exemptions to the 2010 Equalities Act, which prevents discrimination based on religion or race, for charities in cases where discrimination allows an organisation to prevent or compensate for a disadvantage linked to a protected characteristic such as religion, but not colour.Applicants for one of the Orthodox Jewish charity’s 90 homes have to say whether they are strictly orthodox, in terms of observing the sabbath and strict dietary laws, as well as stating under the “ethnic origin” heading whether they are Ashkenazi or Sephardi. The waiting list for the homes includes more than 1,000 Orthodox families, and when it made new homes available last February up to 369 households bid for each property.The judges said the housing association was enabling Orthodox Jews to avoid disadvantage and meet their needs, including solving overcrowding which is a major problem in the area, which is Europe’s largest Haredi community. Haredi Jews tend to have more children than the average.They quoted Rabbi Abraham Pinter, a leading figure in Stamford Hill, who told the court: “Being part of a community, both physically and spiritually, is a prerequisite of fulfilling the life of an Orthodox Jew.” They also cited antisemitic threats and violence, quoting one tenant describing their terror when “one night two men came to our door and threw stones at our front door and windows”.Elliot Lister, solicitor for the housing association, said: “The court has endorsed the critical work of a charity established to fight antisemitism and discrimination in the face of allegation that it itself discriminates. The Jewish community, and even more so the obviously Orthodox Jewish community, faces an ongoing battle against antisemitism, recognised by their Lordships as widespread and increasing and overt.”Ita Cymerman-Symons, chief executive of the housing association, said: “I firmly believe that our work contributes to alleviating in our small way a national housing crisis, freeing up other social housing for others. We do not take properties from others, but we lessen the queue for other properties.”Carrier said: “My clients are disappointed in the judgment and it is our intention to appeal to the court of appeal. “Hackney has a housing allocation scheme that is designed to give the scarce resources of Stamford Hill to those in the greatest need. Orthodox Jews will be among them. But if somebody else, like my client who is struggling with disabled children and living where they are not safe, then they shouldn’t be queue-jumped on the basis of the religion. This isn’t about antisemitism. This is about a fair system for allocating housing. There are lots of BME and faith-based housing associations and they do not apply this strict criteria.”She said the judgment, if it stands, would have wider implications for the provision of services by charities in other sectors as well.Christopher Baker and Rea Murray, who appeared as counsel for the charity, said: “It will have particular significance for many organisations looking to undertake forms of positive action, and for charities seeking to restrict the benefits they provide, in favour of only certain limited descriptions of people with protected characteristics.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d92639fee97068d7232079ce8aa629cae4a891/157_194_2107_1264/master/2107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e19d51970337142bf51565bd44f60091","title":"thousands of six nations tickets touted on viagogo investigation reveals","story":"More than a thousand tickets for the Six Nations have appeared for sale on the controversial website Viagogo for a combined £370,000, according to  analysis that illustrates the grip wielded by ticket touts over in-demand events.Details of the scale at which Six Nations tickets are being touted prompted concern from the digital minister, Margot James, and condemnation from rugby governing bodies, who warned that Viagogo’s customers risk being refused entry at the turnstile. examined 1,155 tickets with a “Trader” label advertised on Viagogo for the Six Nations and found they were being listed for £369,526, including VAT, delivery costs and booking fees, collected by the website.The true amount of tickets controlled by touts is likely to be much higher, given that the ’s analysis covered only two days of Viagogo listings.These tickets, two-thirds of which were in the hands of just five traders, are listed despite the risk that buyers will be turned away at the door.James said the ’s findings were very concerning. “Fans should be able to attend major sporting events at a fair price,” she said.She pointed out that Viagogo was the subject of a court order by the Competition and Markets Authority, which has taken action against the company over alleged breaches of consumer law. “Viagogo must now make any necessary changes without delay and I expect the CMA to take further action if they fail to do so,” she said.The CMA has already warned that it has “serious concerns” about Viagogo’s compliance with the terms of the court order. And listings for Six Nations games raise fresh doubts about whether the company is abiding by its terms.The trader with the highest combined ticket worth was listed as Enda Stanley who had 173 tickets for sale with a total asking price of £79,719 (including booking fees and delivery).While the CMA’s court order calls for traders’ full contact information to be advertised, entries for Stanley’s tickets simply listed his details as “Dublin”.The highest number of tickets for sale by an inidual trader was under the name of an Eileen Green, who listed 290 tickets with a combined price of £64,704.Another prolific seller, a company called Tick Tock Ltd that listed its address as Panama City, had 100 tickets the combined cost of which stood at £45,981. Another trader, Candy \u0026amp Co, gave a postbox address in Texas, while a fifth, Tyne and Wear Ltd, is based in Newcastle.The most expensive tickets, for sale by a trader listed as “harry tout” carried a total cost of £4,772 for two seats in the fourth row with a view of the tryline for the sold-out match between Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield on 9 February.The tickets were marked as “Resale not allowed”.Despite the CMA’s court order, which demands that traders give their genuine contact details, the address for “harry tout” was given as the Scottish newspaper the Daily Record, which has campaigned virulently against ticket touting. The Daily Record said it had no involvement with the listing.None of the traders could be reached for comment.A spokesman for the Rugby Football Union said the use of secondary market websites to resell tickets is prohibited by the RFU’s ticket terms and conditions and that ticket holders known to have breached the terms and conditions would be refused entry.“Where tickets are resold on secondary market websites – especially at inflated prices – it is not just the genuine fans, but the wider game, whom suffer.”The Irish Rugby Football Union urged fans not to buy resold tickets, which they said might be cancelled. The Welsh Rugby Union also warned fans against buying from ticket resale companies, warning that buyers risked ejection from the ground.This stance does not appear to dissuade traders. Touts have 194 tickets for sale for Scotland vIreland alone with a combined ticket price of £57,758 which, if sold, will prove the most lucrative game of the tournament for traders.Traders are selling 223 tickets for sale for the Scotland v Wales match on 9 March with a combined value of £49,318.When contacted, Viagogo said it was “perfectly legal” to resell tickets and that any bought through its website were valid and should not result in fans being turned away.A spokesperson said: “Event organisers sometimes make claims that they will deny entry to people who have purchased resold tickets. These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal.“Therefore, as with all tickets on our platform, Viagogo customers should feel confident that they will gain entry to the event, and that is why we back every ticket with the Viagogo guarantee.”Under the terms of the CMA’s court order secured against the company, Viagogo has been obliged to publish not just names of touts but also more detailed information about what consumers are buying, such as seat number at the venue.But the  found dozens of cases that did not display the seat number.Tom Watson, the shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport and deputy Labour leader, said it was “disgraceful to see that ticket touts on Viagogo are still ripping off rugby fans”.“Viagogo has been told time and again that it needs to clean up its act. They are flagrantly disobeying the law and even ignoring a court order. It’s unacceptable that consumers may not be able to see basic details about their tickets, like the seller’s name and the seat number. Secondary ticketing platforms have been taking advantage of loyal fans for far too long. This has got to change.”In late January the CMA, which had given Viagogo until mid-January to overhaul its business practices, said the changes made by Viagogo after the court order were “insufficient”.Viagogo, in turn, issued a statement which simply said: “We are compliant.” analysed all listings for Six Nations tickets listed on the Viagogo website which carried a “Trader” logo on two consecutive days.The analysis covers 1,007 unique tickets on sale on the Viagogo website on Wednesday 30 January plus 148 unique tickets which subsequently came up for sale on Thursday 31 January. Checks were carried out to ensure no duplicate tickets were recorded by manually checking the ticket details, price and trader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f601f3865a5dfcbb6b31e74085fba43b977686ee/0_354_4674_2805/master/4674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40a3cdf5d9f05bfd62e231ce537f8f39","title":"gerry cranham simply the best in pictures","story":"Over the course of a career which ned half a century, photographer Gerry Cranham led the field of sports photography, defining how we understand this genre today.

Our writer pops byOn Oslo’s Victoria Terrasse there’s a white door marked 108. Behind it was once an office in the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but before that, late in the 19th century, these rooms were occupied by a figure who has done more for Norway’s reputation abroad than all of its foreign ministers put together.This was the apartment of Henrik Ibsen, generally regarded as the second-greatest playwright ever, and the second most-performed dramatist in the world. In both these criteria he is bested only by Shakespeare.Ibsen’s living quarters have now become a significant venue in his thriving theatrical afterlife. For a week in January, two of Norway’s leading classical actors – Kåre Conradi and Pia Tjelta – were rehearsing here with a cast of Norwegian and UK-based actors for a bilingual production of Ibsen’s 1888 play The Lady from the Sea, which premieres this week in London.This cross-country staging is produced by the Norwegian Ibsen Company, founded by Conradi. The actor got government permission to rehearse The Lady from the Sea in the dramatist’s old flat, and hopes in the future to stage productions in its rooms, and a courtyard below. The company also hopes to tour Ibsen around the world, much like the Royal Shakespeare Company, with this London run a declaration of intent.“Ibsen is Norwegian by birth but in spirit international,” says Conradi, showing me around the rooms. What was once the Ibsens’ kitchen is now a government broom cupboard.The dramatist lived above Victoria Terrasse from 1891-95, a period that represents much of his creative life in Norway. Ibsen had left his homeland in 1864, disgusted by its politics and cultural conservatism. He exiled himself for 27 years to Italy and Germany, during which his dim view of Norwegian taste seemed to be confirmed when Ghosts, which dared to use inherited venereal disease as a metaphor for the damage families inflict, was rubbished on publication. His plays appeared in book form first and were not performed in Oslo until years later.“When he finally came home, it was to this flat,” says Conradi. His reception from Norwegians, he adds, was “so ecstatic that he wrote a poem that includes the line, ‘Perhaps I should have come sooner.’”In Oslo, Conradi has the level of fame and admiration Ralph Fiennes might have in Britain. Conradi also gets stopped and selfied by tourists, since he starred in the Netflix Viking drama Norsemen, and played Jens Smit, a Dutch PR visionary, in W1A.At the the read-through in Ibsen’s old living rooms, Conradi, Tjelta and another Norwegian actor, Øystein Røger, sit alongside four British performers. The Norwegian director, Marit Moum Aune, has boldly cast young performers with minimal stage experience.Molly Windsor won a Bafta for Three Girls, about the Rotherham grooming scandal Edward Ashley is soon to appear with Timothée Chalamet in The King and Marina Bye has featured in movies including Breathe. Even the most theatre-experienced, Adrian Rawlins, has recently spent most of his time on screen, including playing Harry Potter’s father, James.The Lady from the Sea dramatises the marriage between Dr Wangel, a widowed GP, and Ellida, reluctant stepmother to Hilde and Bolette, daughters from his first marriage. In this production the Wangels – played by Rawlins, Windsor and Bye – are expats from England, drawn to the north-west coast of Norway by the doctor’s relationship with Ellida, the part taken by Tjelta.Ashley plays Lyngstrand, a local artist. Conradi is Arnholm, Bolette’s former tutor, who visits the troubled family, with Røger as the Stranger, a sailor and fugitive from justice, who may have been Ellida’s lover. The play is about the carnage caused by partings. Ellida is haunted by a lost child, a lost lover and her stepdaughters’ lost mother, and is forced to decide between two versions of her life.In this dual-language production, the Wangels mainly speak English to each other, while Ellida talks Norwegian to Arnholm. In London, the Norwegian will be subtitled on the rear wall. For realism, the anglophone members of the Wangel family have to be able to speak the native language to locals, and to Ellida. Because the Stranger appears only late in the play, Røger has been using rehearsal breaks to tutor the visitors.“They record me, and then go away to practise,” he says. “I show them how you form your mouth to get the Norwegian sounds, which are different.” The letter O, which has four differently accented versions in Norwegian, is generally longer and rounder than the English equivalent.In return, because the Stranger is said have spent a lot of time sailing transatlantic routes, Bye, who has an American mother, has been teaching Røger US vowels. Rawlins and Tjelta have also worked on the way in which bilingual partners switch languages. “Mixed-nationality couples,” says Tjelta, “will change in the middle of a sentence, or suddenly use single words from the other language.”One of the Oslo rehearsal days ends early, so that the cast and production team can take a late-afternoon ferry around four nearby islands. This is not recreation but research: true to its title, the work had a water birth.Michael Meyer, the influential English translator and biographer, explains in a preface to his version of The Lady from the Sea that when living in Italy Ibsen used to complain that the Mediterranean was not a “real sea”, pining for Norwegian harbours, lakes and fjords. In 1885, two decades into his exile, he came home for a brief holiday, seeking the sort of Norwegian water he remembered from a childhood in seaside Skien.The writer travelled to Molde, a town on Norway’s north-west coast (whose football club has just lent its manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjær, to Manchester United). Ibsen reportedly spent much of his time in Molde staring lovingly at fjords and out at the crashing Atlantic waves. Locals told him stories of a woman persuaded by a charismatic sailor to leave her husband, and of a husband, presumed drowned, who returned years later to find his wife remarried. From those anecdotes – and the surroundings – the playwright seems to have begun to conceive a drama about people confined and defined by the sea.Two years later, during another seaside break in the Danish resort of Sæby, on the Jutland coast, the 59-year-old Ibsen developed one of the crushes on much younger women that marked his later years. He formed an intense friendship with Engelke Wulff, a 19-year-old, whose dreams of escaping the small town for large achievements elsewhere seem clearly to have helped him develop Hilde and Bolette Wangel, the yearning teenage sisters in The Lady from the Sea.Another source was Agnete og Havmanden, an 18th-century Danish folk-ballad about a wife who is seduced by a merman, with whom she has a sub-aquatic family, and forced to choose between her wet and dry lives.I had hoped that one of the Norwegian members of the company might sing me Agnete’s song on the ferry, but none knew it. As we stand on the deck to watch the spectacular russet sunset, mummifying my face with a scarf to protect against the freezing sea fret, I remember that Tennessee Williams, whose plays were set in the American south, once told a London cast that his work made sense only if the cast and audience understood the effect on the characters of the searing daily heat. When an English actress asked Williams why the women were so “languid”, he explained that, in that climate, it could sometimes be a struggle to breathe or move.Contrastingly, it struck me on the ferry deck that the plays of Ibsen are clarified by an understanding of how dark and cold it is in Norway most of the time, and especially in the north of the country, where The Lady from the Sea takes place.Gesturing at the Oslo dusk, Røger tells me: “If we were in the north now, this is as light as it would ever get during the day. You can see a little light from the sun but you can’t see the sun.”Back on land, we walk through Oslo, past the National Theatre. Above its door are carved in stone the names of the first three dramatists staged there during the gala opening week in 1899: Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, Ludvig Holberg and Ibsen. Although they were seen at the time as a theatrical holy trinity, two of them are rarely performed in Norway now, while the play that represented Ibsen at the premiere – An Enemy of the People – seems, in its depiction of an expert clashing with populist opinion, to become ever more politically topical. And revived in this London production 130 years after its opening night in Denmark, The Lady from the Sea still feels timely in its presentation of women’s choices.“Someone once asked me, ‘So you’re an Ibsen expert?’” says Aune, who has directed most of the major plays, and is about to revive her ballet of Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler in Oslo. “And I said, ‘No, I’m Ibsen-experienced.’ I don’t think you can ever become an expert on him. There’s so much to find.”• The Lady from the Sea is at Print Room at the Coronet, London, 8 February–9 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6880cf98ba8378b7010ede11e9ab764781bac778/0_121_5078_3048/master/5078.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67f62692a3fff1d9b374a71060a70391","title":"noughts and crosses review malorie blackman novel derby theatre sabrina mahfouz","story":"Derby theatreSabrina Mahfouz has impressively distilled the inspired novel about a world where the power rests with the black populationAt the heart of Malorie Blackman’s young adult novel is an inspired idea, all the more radical for its simplicity: imagine if the power in the world rested not with the white population but with the black.In any other writer’s hands, a story of segregation, insurrection and political violence would be called dystopian here, it is a whisker away from real life. The only difference is the people who can’t get plasters to match their skin colour are white.In its tale of oppression and rebellion, the book evokes the struggles of the ANC and the American civil rights movement. In its portrait of everyday discrimination, it speaks of the here and now. Insert your own Liam Neeson reference here.Put this Romeo and Juliet story on stage, as director Esther Richardson has done in a gripping adaptation for Pilot Theatre, and there’s no escaping the inversion. Here are the wealthy Hadley family of elite “Crosses,” spreading over the full width of the stage with the entitlement their blackness affords them. And here are the poor McGregors, officially “noughts,” colloquially “blankers”, cramped on top of each other, their pale faces denying them not just opportunity but physical space. This is also a story about class – and the damage deprivation does to mental wellbeing.Sabrina Mahfouz’s adaptation skips briskly through the book, streamlining and eliding where necessary but staying close to the blueprint.It’s an impressive distillation, although it does compound Blackman’s tendency to underplay the emotional fallout of the events. You can understand intellectually why Billy Harris’s Callum turns from aspirational student to bitter freedom fighter, but he is given little chance to reflect on it. He seems unknowable as a result.There’s a sense too of the real action happening not with the teenagers but in the world of Chris Jack’s Kamal Hadley, a manipulative politician seen mainly as an enigmatic father figure.Still, Heather Agyepong’s Sephy is more than equal to carrying the play’s emotional weight.

We wonder if the joke is on us when we arrive at the Castle Inn in West Lulworth because the door marked “hotel entrance” is locked. So we trundle our bags into the pub, which is heaving with happy customers on a Saturday afternoon. Eventually, we manage to tell the barmaid we’re here to check in and are steered away towards a tiny reception desk.Not the slick welcome of a smart hotel, then, but the Castle Inn – once a free house known for muddy dogs and real cider – is now steering a tricky course between country pub and boutique hotel.“Pub \u0026amp rooms” is the modest declaration on the outside wall, and it is hard to imagine a more inviting pub. A long, low thatched building, more than 400 years old but freshly whitewashed, with woodwork in duck-egg blue, it sits plum in the middle of the village, at the foot of historic Bindon Hill. Generations of farmers, fishermen and smugglers have sunk flagons of cider here over the centuries but customers these days are mainly day trippers going to Lulworth Cove, half a mile away.It is this market that Bristol-based Butcombe Brewery had in mind when it took over. A refurb finished last year included smartening up the 12 bedrooms and, to some local dismay, knocking together the ground floor’s dark bars and snugs to make a continuous bar-dining area with plenty of nooks and alcoves.We have no complaints: returning near dark after a walk round the cove, we settle with drinks and nibbles in one of two alcoves that are so snug you have to lift a hinged flap on the table to slot yourself in. I have a view through an arch to the main bar area, all handsome golden retrievers and moppets rosy-cheeked after a run on the beach. The ceilings are as low as ever, and Mind Your Head signs abound.Upstairs, things are more boutique hotel, with rooms named after local beauty spots. Ours is decorated in grey and dark greeny-blue with lots of reclaimed wood – design feature du jour – on walls and in the sleek, compact bathroom. (Can there be enough old floorboards in the country to satisfy interior designers. Are they secretly distressing new planks to meet demand?)We like the big bed, cute two-seater sofa in the bay and fresh milk in a fridge up the corridor. Some features seem to be whimsy for its own sake, though – the desk lamp is a grey ceramic puppy – and the metal cog light fittings are a bit industrial chic for this country setting.At dinner, it’s back to pub mode. Drinkers stand chatting by the bar, people are playing cards, and there’s no table service. You order drinks and food at a busy counter, collecting cutlery and napkins as you go. The old pub was known for welcoming man’s best friend and that hasn’t changed (six bedrooms are dog-friendly). I’m quite happy when a neighbouring table’s black retriever settles at my feet, though some might prefer a canine-free dining experience.The grub is high-end pubby: burgers, fish and chips, steak and “flatbread” pizzas. Starters of ham hock terrine studded with peas (£8) and potted chalk stream trout (£7.50) are imaginatively garnished with pickled bits and bobs, and husband’s main of Brixham Bay mussels with coconut milk (£12) is fresh and tasty. But a portion of sticky toffee pudding (£6) is served too tepid to melt the scoop of ice-cream on top.There’s plenty of heat upstairs, though! The inn’s thatched roof sits like a luxuriant monobrow over the first floor windows and we come to understand the advantages of this quaint feature. Central heating plus that thick hat of straw make the room so toasty we have to open windows to the January night.At breakfast there’s a return to trendy hotel territory. As well as the full English, there are two fishy and three veggie choices. I eschew the millennials’ favourite of avocado toast and go for excellent black bean hash with peppers, onions, spinach and poached eggs. An establishment with a split personality, then: chic rooms and on-trend breakfast but the offhand (though friendly) service of a busy pub.However, it’s a good-humoured, affordable bolthole in a gorgeous village walking distance from iconic coastal spots: the Cove is 15 minutes, Durdle Door about 45.

We know what happened to the stars, but what about Fun Bobby, Jack Geller and the other characters?In May 1994, a then-unknown actor called Jennifer Aniston ran into a studio set made up to look like a Manhattan coffee house, and flopped on to a sofa. She wore a white wedding dress, her hair was wet from the rain, and she had just run out on her wedding. Around her, a group of relatively unknown actors – Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox – gawped. And so began the first episode of a sitcom about six friends, written by New York City playwrights David Crane and Marta Kauffman.Twenty-five years on, Friends is still one of the most successful television shows of all time. After it arrived on Netflix on New Year’s Day 2018, it became the most-streamed show on the internet. And, despite the fact that the final episode was broadcast in May 2004, long before the vast majority of them were born, it is the favourite TV programme of the UK’s five- to 16-year-olds.The show’s stars are now exceedingly famous and obscenely rich. By the final series, they were each being paid $1m an episode, making Aniston, Cox and Kudrow the highest-paid female TV actors of all time.But before Friends became a cultural phenomenon, before the “Which friend are you?” quizzes, the layered haircuts and the cries of: “We were on a break!” – and before the show became a trusted companion on hungover days spent in bed – Friends was just another television pilot being tested for NBC executives in the hope of being picked up.May 4, 1994: the Friends pilot is filmed on the Warner Bros lot in Burbank, California. In it, five friends – Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Chandler Bing, Joey Tribbiani and Monica’s brother, Ross – are hanging out at their favourite coffee house when Rachel Green runs in. Ross has just separated from his wife, Carol, who has gone off with another woman. And Rachel has just stood up her fiance, Barry, at the altar and is in need of a place to stay. By the end of the episode, Rachel has moved in with Monica and started working at the coffee house.Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber, Rachel’s orthodontist ex-fiance): It sounds a little egomaniacal to say that I’m the reason the show exists. But when you look at the pilot, with Rachel dumping me at the altar and coming in to meet everybody, that moment was the impetus for the show.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller, Ross’s and Monica’s mother): I knew Jennifer Aniston would be a huge success from the moment I saw her in rehearsals. But I didn’t know that the show would be. I’ve done so many pilots I thought were good that didn’t work, and so many that I thought were bad that did work. I just knew I was witnessing a really special actor at work.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Back in the day, there used to be something called pilot season. Everyone wanted to test their pilots to see how audiences reacted to them. Actors would fly in from Chicago or New York and live in LA for the three months of pilot season, and audition every day, just hoping to get into one of those shows that would get picked up and made into a series. I got the script for Friends in the middle of the season. The second I read it, I called my agent and said: “We have to make this happen.”Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby, Monica’s on-off boyfriend in seasons one and two): I was so young and full of myself, and I’d just done a pilot for Fox’s new medical show. I thought I was the coolest person in the world. I was at home, and my agent said: “Hey, do you want to go and audition for this new show?” It was a really small part, so, of course, I’m whining like a little actor. But something inside me told me, just do it. So I went in and cried in front of Marta Kauffman, and she was like: “Great!”Directing the pilot is James Burrows, co-creator of Cheers.Elliott Gould (Jack Geller, Ross and Monica’s father): I wanted to work for Jim. I’d heard a lot about him: that he knew what he was doing, and he was smart. And he understood what was funny. At one point, I actually called casting because there were some people who said: “No, no, no. Friends is not enough money for you.” But I wanted to work and meet new people.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Burrows was instrumental in creating the atmosphere of Friends. He took the six leads to Vegas before they started working, and they all had a good time together. That was probably very helpful in cementing a sweetness about them.Casting for Friends takes months, and executive producers Kauffman and Crane, and fellow producer Kevin S Bright, see hundreds of hopefuls.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): I was brought in to audition for Ross and Chandler. I went back multiple times, and then they realised Ross was the role for me. I got down to the very end, and was testing for the show. At the last minute, they said: “We’re bringing in one more guy to read.” That guy turned out to be David Schwimmer.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger, the building superintendent): I knew Matt Perry socially a bit, years before. When he was a kid, he used to come into the Formosa bar on Santa Monica, which was a famous Hollywood hangout. I was a patron, and we’d chat. He was a really precocious kid – but very interesting. He’d done lots of pilots already, and was on the cusp of becoming a star.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo, Rachel’s Italian boyfriend in season one): They were all very normal. All of them had a great human side. They were very humble – and really trained. They’d spent years trying to get the right jobs.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): At the beginning of Friends, Matt LeBlanc was anxious. Every time he did something, he would look for approval to the director, the producers or the writers if they were around. There would be a look of: “Am I doing this right?” He ended up being amazing. He was so perfect as Joey. He slowly built that character into a wonderful, real person.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): Those kids were just ready to pop they were all good enough to have their own shows. And the casting people somehow put them together at the time, and they were all just ready to have something wonderful happen – and it did.After the pilot is taped, NBC orders a further 12 episodes.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): When I taped my first episode, no one had seen it on TV yet. While we were filming, they announced the show had been commissioned for 12 episodes. Jennifer Aniston basically cried in my lap because nothing like that had ever happened to her before.Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles, Monica and Rachel’s irritable downstairs neighbour): I was there before it all started. I got there early and was watching rehearsals, and the show hadn’t been on the air yet, but I remember thinking: “These young actors are really talented.”Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): There was this excitement. There was no ego on set. People had a sense of how good the project was.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): My son was born on 10 September 1994. The next day, my agent called and said: “Friends has come back around again they’ve let go of Anita Barone and would like you to take over the part tomorrow.” I said: “Wow, I’m kind of sore! I don’t think so.” But my agent said: “Jane, this is a huge offer. They’ve said they’ll go easy on you, and you can bring your nanny.” I said: “I don’t have a nanny! I’ve got my mom.” “So bring your mom!” So I sat down and nursed my son, and watched the pilot episode. And the moment I saw David Schwimmer do the longest take ever, I was hooked. I knew I had to work with him.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was starstruck by David Schwimmer. Of course, the girls were incredible and you sort of fell in love with them. But David was the one I desperately wanted to like me and he was the one most not interested in meeting anyone.Mitchell Whitfield (Barry Farber): Towards the end of the first season, I started getting people saying: “Oh, you’re that jerk on Friends.” That’s when I thought: “This thing is definitely starting to take off.”Friends airs on 22 September 1994. The initial critical response is lukewarm, but viewers like the show, and ratings are solid. By the end of the 1994-1995 season, Friends is the eighth most-watched show on air.Larry Hankin (Mr Heckles): I went home, and the show didn’t air for months, so I forgot about it. And then it came out, and it was a hit.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): They weren’t stars when it all started. They were becoming very popular, and probably working on their contracts, but it wasn’t like you were walking into a room full of superstars. That came a bit later.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I taped the first season, and there was a comic warming up the studio audience, and the energy was good. By the time we filmed the second year, it was like a circus. I remember metal detectors. The studio was packed with people. That was around the time that the Rolling Stone cover came out with all six of them – May 1995.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): In season two, there was a change in everything. You’d notice it in the cars they would drive, or they’d talk about buying this or that. There was wealth coming in.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): Because I was part of the early days, they weren’t so private around me. But other guest stars would complain about how they didn’t have access to this or that area. They had to clamp down on security and be much tighter about who went up into the dressing rooms, and that kind of thing.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): You know, someone’s life changes when they get a big paycheck. The money starts rolling in, and you’re obliged to spend it. They would be recognised and followed, and there would be paparazzi. It wasn’t easy for them to just have a coffee at the corner any more. But as people? They didn’t change. Not with me.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): The first season, they had a show that was doing pretty well on the air, and it looked like they were going to do more, but they weren’t the Beatles. And then they came back the second year, and they were the Beatles.By season three, the cast have made the decision to negotiate their contracts as a group, even though this means some members will take a pay cut. They continue negotiating as a group for the show’s entire run.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): As a group, they decided it was time to get more of a share of the profits. It was quite a risk. They were putting it all on the line.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green, Rachel’s mother): It’s unusual to do contracts together, and I think they set a standard for a lot of other shows to follow. When the network is negotiating against you, one at a time, things can become adversarial. But they all realised, to their benefit, that it took every single one of them to make the show that good.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I was on the lot this one time. I’d just had lunch. And I came around the corner, and I see Jen, Lisa and Courteney. It had just rained, which is a rarity in LA, right? And they’re splashing in this puddle outside the sound stage. I was so struck by it because there was no one else around, and they were just falling around laughing with one another. That was the lightning in the bottle because they captured that joy of being friends, and that playfulness, and it was magic. The love this group had for one other was extraordinary.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): They were a united group. They would watch each other’s work. If someone had a scene they weren’t in, the others would watch it and laugh. It’s very unusual to be so supportive of each other on set.Paget Brewster (Kathy, Joey and then Chandler’s girlfriend in season four): They would make fun of each other. If someone made a joke and it didn’t work, they’d all turn on the person and be like: “You blew it, Lisa!” They would bust each other’s balls. And they started adding this thing into the script that they did to each other in real life: one of them would be talking, and they’d all pretend to fall asleep.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): You’d do a pass of a scene. If the audience didn’t laugh, we’d huddle together and Matthew Perry would say: “What if we tried this?” And Matt LeBlanc would say: “Yeah!” And we’d break again and do the scene. It was like being at a football game.Paget Brewster (Kathy): Matthew Perry always had to have the last bit. If it was the end of the scene, he would consistently pitch something. They’d make fun of him for literally always wanting to have the last laugh.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Everything begins and ends with the writing. David and Marta didn’t write every show – they hired a lot of good writers – but they had the final say, and they had impeccable taste.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens, Ross’s girlfriend in season six. She was one of his students, and Bruce Willis played her father): We’re in the cabin in one episode, and Ross and I are making out on the couch. He says: “I can’t stop thinking about your dad.” The writers stopped and said: “After he says that, why don’t you say: ‘Whatever works for you?’” We added the joke in at the last minute, and it was so funny. They could just come up with stuff like that on the spot.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): David and Marta would come down from the office to watch the run-throughs, which was terrifying. They’d sit in a row of chairs, with the writers and NBC executives. And you could see they were thinking, and they’d give comments and then go back upstairs and change it all. David and Marta were the giant stars of the writing team.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): There was one joke we kept changing. We couldn’t get it right. It was the episode where Susan and I are celebrating our anniversary, and Ross comes over at an inopportune moment, and I had to telegraph to him that it isn’t a good time. So I removed a little pube from my tongue. That was the only time I pitched something that was really outrageous, and it actually got on air.With Friends’ increased popularity comes intense media scrutiny. But on set it’s business as usual.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler, Joey and then Ross’s girlfriend): I remember walking into Monica’s apartment, and looking out of the window to see if I could see Ugly Naked Guy, but of course it’s just a hallway back there.Paget Brewster (Kathy): I was terrified of those guys. I hid in my room because they were so famous. It was the biggest show in the country.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): It was a very intimidating set to walk into. I think the cast had had some pretty notable experiences with guest actors coming in and struggling because of the pressure of having to be funny on the Friends set.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): It’s not always easy to walk into a show that has already been established and where everyone has their characters, and they’re a tight-knit family. Sometimes, it’s not roomy enough for a new person to come in. But they made it very roomy.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): I got called in to do a “chemistry read” with David Schwimmer. It was terrifying because the producers told me to come in looking “as hot as possible”. I didn’t know what to do with that information. It sent me into a tailspin. I stayed up all night trying to figure out what to wear … Now that I’m older, I wouldn’t be happy getting that message.By the time Friends wraps its final season in 2004, the lead actors have become some of the highest-paid TV stars of all time, earning $1m an episode.Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): My wife, she cringes a little bit because if I had ended up getting the part of Ross, I’d have made tens of millions of dollars. But I never think about that.Jane Sibbett (Carol Willick): I’m quite content. Obviously, I didn’t get paid the million-dollar paycheck, but I’ve had the best of Friends. I was able to raise my children and I got offered some really sweet projects.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I have a little bit of regret I feel like I could have capitalised more on the success of the show. I was having a orce, and was distracted by my personal life. I didn’t get a publicist, which I should have done.Mike Hagerty (Mr Treeger): People have a tendency to pigeonhole you a little bit, but it’s always good to have something that people can recognise you from.In the two and a half decades since Friends first aired, the show has been continually rerun. In recent years, critics have re-evaluated the show’s legacy, identifying problematic storylines and criticising Friends for its lack of ersity.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): Today, one of the six would have to be black, of course.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): My character wasn’t written on the page to be a woman of colour, and I auditioned against a lot of other women of different ethnic backgrounds, so I like to think they picked me because I was the right person for the role. But I knew it was something new for the show, and it was really important because, the fact of the matter was, it was a show set in Manhattan that was almost entirely Caucasian. It was an unrealistic representation of what the real world looked like.Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): There was one scene where I was getting a massage, and I had to be this greasy guy who was touching Phoebe’s ass. I had a problem with how it portrayed me, as if guys from Italy are like that. What they wanted me to do was quite disrespectful. But I remember we were able to find a compromise, so I felt comfortable.Paget Brewster (Kathy): It’s so bizarre to compare the show at that time to what’s happening now on social media. No one can do anything right, ever. That’s basically where we are. Everything is people being questioned or attacked. Yeah, if you look at the world today, and you look at Friends, you go: “Oh, wow, there were gay jokes and they don’t have friends of colour.” But that’s what it was then.In 2018, Netflix acquired the rights to Friends in a $100m deal. Thanks to streaming, the show has become known to a new, younger audience.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): As an actor, you want to be a part of something: your work will be here when you’re gone. And you get an insight into that when a show that is 25 years old gets reissued on Netflix, and a whole new audience discovers it.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): My 12-year-old niece just asked me for a T-shirt with “Central Perk” on it. That’s so bizarre to me. She wasn’t even alive when I worked on the show.Christina Pickles (Judy Geller): Kids come up to me and recite the script.Paget Brewster (Kathy): People in their 20s recognise my voice. They turn around in supermarkets and say: “You’re Kathy!”Mitchell Whitfield (Dr Barry Farber): “Dude, what was it like? You got to kiss Jennifer Aniston!”Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I met Taylor Swift, and she said: “I know you! I’m a Friends freak! You’re Mr Geller.”Cosimo Fusco (Paolo): I can work in the most exquisite film, but the minute people find out I was Paolo, they’re like: “Oh my God!”Now, 25 years since the show first aired, Friends is the most-streamed show in the UK, and perhaps even the most beloved TV show of all time.Paget Brewster (Kathy): A show like Friends was one in a million. Normally a pilot doesn’t go, or it goes and you shoot three episodes, or you make a year and it’s gone.Aisha Tyler (Dr Charlie Wheeler): There have been other shows that have advanced that concept of friends as chosen family, but Friends was just a perfect encapsulation of that idea.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): They’re independent, their parents aren’t telling them what to do, they’re making their own decisions, they’re making their own mistakes – and they’re succeeding at it! That’s aspirational for young people to see.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): Television was a very different thing back then. I don’t know if there will ever be another show as successful as Friends. I feel like there’s too much content out there now, and too much variety.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): I was so young. I was 27. I don’t remember feeling young then, but now it’s like looking back in time. But I love looking back at it. It’s a good memory, and it’s a reminder that time is passing. Not a lot of people get to look at where they were half their lifetime ago.Alexandra Holden (Elizabeth Stevens): It feels like a different life. When I watch Friends now, I think: “Was I really there? Did that really happen? Was I really part of this thing that’s become such a huge influence all these years later?” It’s kind of surreal.Marlo Thomas (Sandra Green): Everything you do is part of the tapestry of your career, and your life. Every little thread gets pulled in some way. And the Sandra Green thread is certainly a colour in my tapestry that people remember and have some affection for, as do I.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): When someone comes up to you and says: “Hey, you were good on Friends,” it connects you with them in a way. You were part of a thing that meant something to them, and that means something to me. It makes you feel like: “Maybe you didn’t really waste your life.”Elliott Gould (Jack Geller): I saw Matt LeBlanc at the studio recently, and we embraced. Without being pretentious, we’re all a part of each other.Vincent Ventresca (Fun Bobby): Things don’t change as much as you think they do. What’s important to us: friendship, family, community and laughing at silly situations. That’s what Friends is all about. And that’s timeless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d04dc2f525ee0dc094903543914b65cb3f3f9c/0_254_7598_4559/master/7598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23dd84e66b43b5adcec047031968619a","title":"the new and improved das boot now with added women","story":"The submarine epic was never begging to be remade. But this sequel is just as compelling, just as claustrophobic ... and has some much-needed moments on dry landPlunderers of TV past will always run into opposition. Never go back, some say, and you can see the argument. Rifling through television’s ever-growing canon will always leave you open to accusations of grave-robbing, sacrilege or being too lazy to come up with your own ideas. Not that this has ever stopped the industry from remixing the classics. The aim is to engage a new audience with a known winner while keeping fans of the original onboard. The launch of Das Boot this week comes with equal parts fear and excitement it will float or sink on its ability to resurrect the spirit of the original while showing us something we haven’t seen before. This is no easy task.Fortunately, they nail it. Andreas Prochaska’s eight-part series is a classy revisiting of the Das Boot universe that retains the claustrophobic doom of Wolfgang Petersen’s classic film while weaving in enough new threads to give it its own identity. Most British viewers first encountered Das Boot when the TV miniseries aired in 1985. Its impact was profound. We’d seen second world war stories from the German point of view before, but rarely at such close quarters, with so much tension and such devastating results. We learn the stakes early on. The opening slate tells us: “The battle for control of the Atlantic is turning against the Germans … 40,000 German sailors served on U-boats during the second world war … 30,000 never returned.” Right from the off, we know the U-boat is a tomb.Expect more of that bleak foreboding in the modern Das Boot, which is technically a sequel, taking place nine months after the original, on a new U-boat with a fresh crew. The underwater scenes retain the hypnotic rhythm of the movie’s sound design – alien but compelling. The action, when it comes, is fraught and desperate, but much worse is the waiting. Knowing the enemy is out there as you sit submerged and trapped, outmanned and outgunned with nothing but your terrified comrades and sense of mortality for company is a circumstance to chill the heartiest of souls. The Germans don’t know it yet, but the Enigma code has been cracked, making them fish in a barrel for the allied fleet. The hunger, squalor and enforced intimacy of submarine life add another dead weight of pressure to the already fragile psyche.But the sequel spends a lot of time on dry land, too. Translator Simone Strasser (the brilliant Vicky Krieps), sister of the U-boat’s radio operator, Frank, gets tangled up with a French Resistance cell led by an American woman Carla Monroe (deftly played by Lizzy Caplan). As Frank faces underwater death daily, Simone is barely more comfortable knowing that her new acquaintances are her passport to incarceration, torture and death. An underground trade in morphine only complicates matters. Simone would like to do the right thing, but this is not a world that rewards virtue. No one said war was a laugh riot.Simone and Carla are the extra dimension Das Boot needs. While forgetting what made the original great is always a danger with reboots, equally fatal is the failure to offer anything new. As grim and fatalistic as it is, Das Boot never seemed a story that begged to be remade, but the doomed submarine with its walking dead crew is a powerful premise that can still tell us something about humanity in extremis in general, and the futility of war in particular. That every life-and-death incident on the sub ripples out to affect the lives of those on land means there’s plenty of human interest, too. It has already impressed enough to secure itself a second season. Maybe there are even more stories to emerge from the murky depths. A Das Boot franchise? There have been far worse crimes.Das Boot starts on Sky Atlantic on 6 February at 9pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6437f28b79eb79956936c8e9cf133a4fca22851/75_0_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6191b15da7dbc820e603cf8073037835","title":"exercise health move all day standing desk","story":"If you want to dedicate yourself to a lifetime of good habits, don’t start at the gym. Start at the officeA few years ago, James Levine, a doctor of endo­crinology at the Mayo Clinic, sparked a radical change in America’s office furniture. His research had inspired a pile of viral stories cataloging the negative effects of sitting at a desk: leg muscles shut down, blood pressure increases, good cholesterol plummets, your children starve. OK, I made up that last one, but the real takeaway was no less dire. “Excessive sitting is a lethal activity,” Levine, who has studied sedentary behavior for nearly 20 years and is the most widely quoted expert on the topic, told the New York Times in 2011. And the solution – at least the one people heard – was to start standing.Cue the office makeovers. Over the next several years, workers all across America embraced stand-up desks. At Outside’s headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, our building manager furiously reconfigured work spaces. Desks were removed from their shelving brackets, raised a foot and a half, and remounted. Walking the hallways, I’d do double takes every time I realized that another editor had taken a stand against sitting. Close to half our offices were eventually con­verted. Good science had spurred a small change that was dramatically improving our health. We were literally rising from the dead!Or were we? The stand-up revolution was followed by another wave of stories reporting that being on your feet in the same place all day has its own downsides, including increased risk of cardiovascular problems. What’s more, at least at Outside, few people’s habits really changed. This morning, I took a tour around our building to assess our commitment to stand-up desks. In 14 of the converted spaces, editors were either hunched over on stools or perched on chairs that they had elevated to meet the new level. They were still sitting, only higher. In a half-dozen other cases, people had simply lowered their desks back to their old positions.When I called Levine and told him what had happened at Outside, he let out the sigh of a man who’d heard all this before. “It’s not the furniture that makes the difference, it’s the behavior,” he said. “The desk without the behavior doesn’t help you.”In other words, we missed the larger point that Levine and his colleagues were trying to convey. The solution to sitting isn’t to stand, though it helps. In fact, according to the findings of a 2015 consensus panel on the topic, we need to be on our feet two to four hours while at work. But the real solution is to move. All day. The stillness is what’s killing us. We should be pacing the hallways and climbing stairs and squatting and lunging and stretching.Now that requires a radical change, one exponentially more difficult than putting your desk on stilts. But aiming for more movement might also be the most important habit you adopt from an issue of Outside packed with 72 pages of fitness advice. This is especially true if, like me, you exercise vigorously each day and therefore consider yourself healthy. Researchers have shattered that idea. I might run for an hour every weekday morning, but studies show that if I then go to work and sit at my desk for epic stretches, which I do, I am no more immune to the side effects of sedentary living than the prototypical couch potato.When I accepted this scary conclusion, I realized how difficult moving really is. I’m not like my ancestors who worked on a farm where motion was an all-day requirement. My job seems specifically designed to keep me wasting away in a chair. A phone and a computer allow me to communicate and conduct business with nearly any writer on earth without leaving a two-foot radius.Still, I was determined to be the guy who changed his behavior. (Writing this article was a great motivator.) It didn’t go so well at first. I arrived at work determined to move more, but once I sat at my desk, old habits glued me to the computer and I forgot all about my intentions. So I placed a sticky note on my office door that said FARTHER, a little prompt reminding me to use the facility most distant from me every time I needed a drink of water or bathroom break. I also connected my computer to the printer downstairs and across the building. And rather than sending ­e-mails or using the phone, I tried to go directly to colleagues’ offices.Once I had those tricks nailed, I got some digital help. There are dozens of fitness wearables that can remind you to move, from the basic step counter to the fully loaded Apple Watch. Instead, I went with a free phone app called Move. It buzzes every 45 minutes and assigns me a random exercise: say, 20 body-weight squats or 15 push-ups. These alerts initially drove me crazy. (Again?!) And their commands can be cloyingly phrased: “It’s time to move it, move it.” But eventually I welcomed the interruptions. I noticed that I felt refreshed when I returned to my desk, like I’d rebooted my clogged circuitry.And the embarrassment? I haven’t exactly been a bold office revolutionary. Instead, I’ve meekly learned to be a stealth mover. Now I either find ways to look like I’m doing something perfectly normal or I make sure I don’t get caught. I do push-ups with an ear cocked toward the door, listening for approaching footsteps. I do wall sits in a corner that no one can see from the hallway. While I’m on the phone, I pace as if I’m carefully deliberating vital magazine business. At my desk, I do inconspicuous yoga poses with names like seated eagle and hip opener. I do laps around the building carrying papers to look as if I’m going somewhere, when all I’m really doing is walking in a large, 223-step circle back to my office. (If you want the full log from a recent day, see “Self Pro Motion”, below.)Am I happier? Less stressed? More productive? Any con­clu­sions I draw from my exper­iment would be based on anec­dotal evidence, the enemy of real research. But here’s what’s certain: if I continue to squeeze in an extra hour or two of movement each day, I’ll be significantly healthier in the long run. That’s the takeaway Levine and his colleagues need us to hear.If you want to dedicate yourself to a lifetime of good habits, don’t start at the gym.

If you stay in this position, your life will be a misery,’” it said.The consultants, who focused on Amnesty’s international secretariat, based in London, found it to be largely operating in a “state of emergency” following a restructuring process to decentralise and move staff closer to the ground in places of civil unrest and conflict.Many staff at Amnesty described their employment as a vocation or life cause and said there had a “significant risk of experiencing secondary stress or vicarious trauma” due to the nature of the work.But, the report found, the “lion’s share” of wellbeing issues were not isolated to exposure to trauma or suffering. Instead, the adversarial culture, failures in management and pressures of workload were among the most significant contributors to wellbeing issues.“Amnesty International had a reputation for doing great work but being a hard place to work. Across many interviews the word ‘toxic’ was used to describe the Amnesty work culture as far back as the 1990s. So were the phrases ‘adversarial’, ‘lack of trust’ and ‘bullying’.”Staff reported multiple accounts of discrimination on the basis of race and gender and which women, staff of colour and LGBTQI employees were targeted or treated unfairly.“Given Amnesty’s status and mission – to protect and promote human rights – the number of accounts the assessment team received of ‘bullying’,‘racism’, and ‘sexism’ is disconcerting,” it said. The reviewers provided Amnesty’s secretary general with a private report on allegations of abuse of power, discrimination and unfair treatment, which merit further investigation.They found multiple instances of alleged favouritism or nepotism in hiring and cases where “it appears that positions or iniduals may have been made redundant without due process”.One of the issues facing the organisation was a “martyrdom culture”, in which staff would sacrifice their own wellbeing by taking on huge workloads – a clear “recipe for overload and burnout”. The restructuring had “taken a considerable toll” on staff wellbeing, it said.“Amnesty cannot effectively strive to make the world a better place while perpetuating an organisational culture deeply marked by secrecy, mistrust, nepotism and other forms of power abuse.”Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty’s secretary-general, said the review was a difficult and profoundly troubling read. In a statement (pdf), he said he would bring forward a reform plan by the end of March.Amnesty’s work culture problems were first revealed in May last year, when the Times reported that Gaëtan Mootoo had killed himself after complaining of stress and overwork. Six weeks later, Rosalind McGregor, 28, an intern in Amnesty’s Geneva’s office, killed herself at her family home in Surrey.One staff member told the review that the organisation’s response to Mootoo’s death “upset many of us a lot”. “The way they announced it, the way they tried to cover up.”His death was followed by several reviews. One, conducted by James Laddie QC, found that “a serious failure of management” had contributed to Mootoo’s death.A separate inquiry into McGregor’s death concluded that she had been distressed for “personal reasons” and that Amnesty bore no responsibility for her death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f612fb2648462f31eb254b74b8eab25459ead43/0_97_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c1bbba5301a75c791021becf244e6df","title":"italys deputy pm luigi di maio meets senior gilets jaunes figure","story":"Five Star Movement leader’s meeting in Paris is likely to increase tensions with France Luigi Di Maio, the Italian deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), has met a senior figure from the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement – a meeting likely to increase tensions between Italy and France.Di Maio and Alessandro Di Battista, a prominent M5S member, met Christophe Chalençon, as well as candidates that the protest movement has put forward for the European elections in May, on the outskirts of Paris on Tuesday. Posting a photo of the group on Facebook, Di Maio described it as a “beautiful” meeting.“The wind of change has crossed the Alps. I repeat. The wind of change has crossed the Alps,” he wrote.Di Maio had previously expressed his admiration for the gilets jaunes, who have been holding at-times violent anti-government protests each week across France for the past few months. He urged the movement not to “give up” and said the demonstrations reminded him of the spirit that gave birth to the M5S in 2009.On Tuesday he said the two groups shared “many common positions and values that focus on the battles for citizens, social rights, direct democracy and the environment”.Chalençon said that while both sides “practically agree on everything” there is no talk yet about whether they would form an alliance for the elections to the European parliament. Italian media reported that Ingrid Levavasseur, who heads the gilets jaunes’ list of 10 candidates for the elections, will meet M5S officials again in Rome next week.The meeting follows a series of verbal attacks from Di Maio and his co-deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, on the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in recent weeks and is also seen as an additional tactic by the M5S to regain some of the popularity lost to Salvini’s far-right League since the coalition government came to power last June.“M5S is weak right now,” said Massimiliano Panarari, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “They are losing traction in their traditionally antagonistic contingencies and they need to find every antagonistic issue to demonstrate that they are strong. Macron is also the perfect target for populist movements.”Panarari added that the meeting with the gilets jaunes was also a way to tell Italian voters that the M5S still has its “anti-establishment soul” as well as to attract similar groups with whom they might be able to build a coalition after the EU elections.M5S launched its European election campaign in January, with Di Maio and Di Battista travelling to the European parliament in Strasbourg and denouncing the institution as a “waste of money”. At the time, Di Maio said he was preparing an election manifesto with other European populist groups.Opinion polls in France have suggested that the main impact of one or more gilets jaunes candidates standing in the European elections would be to reduce support for the far-right of Marine Le Pen and the far left, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon.“A gilets jaunes party would likely mobilise people who do not usually vote, but also take votes from the National Rally and France Unbowed,” Emmanuel Rivière of pollsters Kantar Public France told Le Monde. “Paradoxically, the principal beneficiary would be the party of the president.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3184486453202a4724643187ef6478676f258b5e/0_204_4674_2804/master/4674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ab2742110cda0eb717fe8001ce187e","title":"venezuela faes special forces nicolas maduro barrios","story":"Activists suspect Nicolás Maduro has tasked Faes with pacifying the city’s barrios in bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of ChavismoA flickering candle and 19 rose petals – one for every year he lived – adorn a shrine in what used to be the home of Alixon Pisani.“We love you,” reads a note beside a black and white photograph of the recently killed teen.It was 10pm on the night of 22 January when friends arrived outside with the news that Pisani was dead gunned down as he demonstrated against Nicolás Maduro’s teetering regime in Catia, a traditionally working-class area of western Caracas.“He was still just a boy,” said the woman who raised him, his aunt, Nivea Pisani.“They are murderers … demons,” she said of her nephew’s killers. “He just went out to protest because we are going hungry. How many more will die if we carry on like this?”Pisani, an unemployed 45-year-old, is still waiting for an official explanation about who shot her nephew and why. His death certificate states he died from a firearm injury but offers no hint of the weapon used – or the motive.But she believes his killers were from Faes, a shadowy and fearsome special forces unit activists suspect Maduro has tasked with pacifying the city’s impoverished redbrick barrios in a bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of Chavismo.“The poor areas are where most people live – and since we don’t support them any more I guess they want to kill us all,” said Pisani, who says witnesses told her Faes agents arrived at the protest shortly before her nephew was shot in the arm and chest.Hugo Chávez first took office in January 1999 – just a few months before Alixon Pisani was born – vowing to blaze a Boilvarian trail for Venezuela’s long-forgotten poor.In his first post-election speech, the comandante promised he would not rest while there were still children in the streets and families going hungry. “Today a new battle starts for the salvation of Venezuela,” Chávez said.In the early years of Chavismo, its leader won global accolades and a cult following for his crusade to help Venezuela’s poor. Social projects known as misiones brought healthcare and education to millions of disenfranchised citizens.But two decades after Chávez’s rise to power, Venezuela is on its knees, and many who were once loyalists have lost faith in his successor. And, increasingly, they are taking to the streets to demand change.“We’ve never had protests here in Catia – this is new,” said Pisani, attributing the shift to the country’s economic and social collapse under Chávez’s heir.“Before, I’d open my fridge and see ham, cheese, eggs, meat, chicken. These days there’s nothing but water – and sometimes we don’t even have that. It’s insanity – we never thought we’d be living like this,” she said.The day he died, Alixon Pisani – who worked in a local bakery – had gone out to protest the “beggary” into which their oil-rich nation has been plunged. “It’s as if there is no government in this country,” Pisani complained. “How can you not go out to protest?”Across town, in a sprawling eastern neighbourhood called José Félix Ribas, Venezuela’s special forces have also made their deadly presence felt in an apparent bid to crush dissent.“It’s the first time they’ve attacked with so much force,” said one local woman, too scared to be named, as she and other residents described a series of war-like operations in the days after opposition leader Juan Guaidó sparked the current political crisis by declaring himself Venezuela’s rightful president on 23 January.A second woman recalled balaclava-wearing, rifle-toting troops swarming into the labyrinthine community like an army of “little black ants”, kicking down doors and shooting.“We heard the bangs: tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka. It was horrible,” said the woman, whose home was stormed.“Even the Chavistas around here don’t agree with Nicolás Maduro,” said her 18-year-old son, who described narrowly escaping death during one operation, sprinting over rooftops and down alleys as the agents opened fire.The teenager, who now sleeps in another part of Caracas for fear of being killed, agreed the repression was designed to dissuade the urban poor from leaving their hilltop homes to join the revolt. “If the barrio goes down it will be like a nuclear bomb.”Things were not always thus, a group of locals explained as they sat around a wooden table in a kitchen equipped with nothing but a broken stove and an almost bare pantry.“Chávez would go into the barrios, into any house, and whichever house Chávez went into they’d say: ‘Have a little cup of coffee, my presidente,’” said the 18-year-old. “They adored him him. They loved him.”And what if Maduro came calling today?“I’d hit him with a chair,” he replied.“We’d keep him here for a week eating what we have to eat – lentils and beans – to see if he liked it,” his mother chuckled sarcastically.“Without any salt,” chipped in a third woman.Faes – the special action force – has earned notoriety since the uprising against Maduro began last month. Graffiti artists have daubed Caracas’ walls with messages denouncing its operatives as “murderers of the people”.But little is known about the elite group’s inner workings or even who exactly commands it. In a recent report, the Venezuelan human rights group Provea said Faes was created by Maduro in 2017 to fight “organized crime and terrorism” and was part of Venezuela’s national police force, although some stories in state-run media outlets describe it as being under the command of the Venezuelan military. By last year it boasted almost 1,300 agents.In a recent post on its Instagram account the group said its role was to “guarantee security, tranquility and peace” for all Venezuelans.But activists say it has taken on an explicitly political role since the most severe challenge to Maduro’s rule erupted last month.In one Instagram video, a Faes commander urges troops to show “absolute loyalty to Maduro” given the “extremely difficult moments” his administration was facing. “As soldiers who are faithful to the revolution, let’s go for it, let’s really go for it – without hesitation,” he says.Provea’s coordinator, Rafael Uzcátegui, said: “What the government is trying to do is contain the discontent, to contain the anger – not by addressing the citizens’ concerns but by instilling terror and fear.”Uzcátegui said his group had counted 43 killings linked to the protests. It had not been possible to identify the perpetrators of each death but he believed Faes was the number one culprit, followed by the pro-government paramilitary groups known as colectivos. Faes’ role appeared to be “neutralizing the greatest possible number of people”, not bringing criminals to justice.Asked about alleged Faes killings on Venezuelan television last week, the attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said the criminal responsibility for such acts was “inidual. Those who commit violations ... will be prosecuted, whichever part of the police they are from.”On Monday, as she prepared for the last of nine evenings of mourning, Pisani said she felt uneasy about the prospect of foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro, but was adamant he had to step down.“I want him to go. He must realize this country is a disaster,” she said.Most of all, though, she wanted answers about the masked gunmen who had condemned her nephew to an unmarked concrete grave.“Why did they kill him? What for?” she asked. “His life had hardly even begun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9330e99791c0078469593cd4e8ac8c1fb370b1d8/0_701_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23c0a23532093e5b832c3a95cfff2e17","title":"working usb stick found in leopard seals year old frozen faeces","story":"New Zealand puts out call to find owner of memory stick spotted in frozen poo sample A functioning USB stick has been found in the scat of a rare Antarctic leopard seal, prompting New Zealand’s national science body to launch a hunt for the owner.Volunteers at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) recovered the device while examining the animal’s frozen faeces – which had been sitting in a freezer for over a year.It revealed a video shot by a kayaker paddling around Porpoise Bay in the Caitlins at the bottom of the South Island. The kayaker is not visible, but the tip of their blue kayak is, as well as footage of leopard seals playing in the cold coastal waters, including a mother and its pup.Leopard seal scat is valuable to scientists because it holds a wealth of information about what the Antarctic predators eat, their general health and how long they have been in New Zealand waters.Around the country, volunteers comb the coastline collecting it for marine biologists, in a bid to learn more about the rare animals, which usually live and hunt in packs in Antarctic waters, but are increasingly heading north to New Zealand, puzzling experts.New Zealanders are also requested to report all sightings of the animals, document their location with videos and photographs, and call a dedicated leopard seal hotline.“It is very worrying that these amazing Antarctic animals have plastic like this inside them,” said Jodie Warren, a volunteer who was working in the lab of marine biologist Dr Krista Hupman when she recovered the USB stick.Warren left the stick to dry for weeks, curious to see if any data could be recovered.The research team are keen to find the owner of the USB stick – and recruit the keen seal watcher to their volunteer army combing the beaches for “golden” poo.A spokesperson for Niwa said there are been “no serious leads yet” on finding the owner, but it would keep trying."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

File photograph: Hannah McKayAs the countdown clock continues to tick down to the UK’s departure from the European Union with no agreement in place, the chances of Brexit being delayed to buy Britain more time have increased.There are a number of options that London could pick from to avoid the heavy economic cost that would come from crashing out of the EU without a deal, though none is straightforward.Delaying BrexitUnder Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - an EU member state’s exit mechanism from the bloc - the UK could seek an extension to the process for a specified period of time but only if each and every one of the other 27 EU member states agrees at the European Council, the group of EU heads of state and government. It is possible that member states might allow an extension but only for a short period of time and in exceptional circumstances, for example, to allow both sides time to make better preparations for a no-deal scenario. The European elections on May 23rd complicate any timeline and MPs must vote to change the “exit day” in the UK’s withdrawal act, which may also spell trouble. The EU is unlikely to allow the UK to delay Brexit for an unspecified period to permit continuing political uncertainty around unspecified alternative arrangements to the contentious backstop to avoid a hard Irish border.Cancelling BrexitThe UK can cancel Brexit unilaterally, without seeking the permission of the other 27 EU member states, according to a ruling of the European Court of Justice last year. If this happened, the UK’s relationship with the EU would remain on the same terms, as it was prior to the Article 50 process. The revocation must take place before the March 29th exit date, must be “unequivocal and unconditional.” In other words, the UK must make it clear it wishes to retain EU membership. Under the ruling, the UK must meet its own constitutional requirements and follow a democratic process. This has been interpreted that the UK would need an act of parliament to revoke Article 50 which could throw up political and even legal challenges given the likely opposition from pro-Brexit MPs. Cancelling Brexit seems the least likely option given that both the two main parties at Westminster have ruled out reversing the UK’s vote to leave the EU.Postponing BrexitThere is nothing, at least no official obstacle, to stop the UK using the revocation of Article 50 to cancel Brexit and then reapplying to leave again at a later date. There is, however, the European Court of Justice’s ruling that revocation must be “unequivocal and unconditional.” This makes it clear that the UK can only revoke to remain, not to buy more time in order to leave on more favourable terms or to avoid a no-deal scenario. The court’s advocate general said prior to the court ruling that revocation could not be an “abusive process” and that it must be done in good faith but there is nothing to stop the UK from deciding to leave at a later date. This tactic would not win the UK many friends in Europe and the EU may be able to veto any revocation if it believes the UK is only playing for time. The court could also render the application to leave void if it believes Britain is revoking with the intention to extend rather than to stay.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoynePA Wire.Theresa May’s speech in Belfast on Tuesday will not have reassured those in Northern Ireland who are angry over last week’s apparent abandonment of the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with the European Union. But it marked an important shift in Britain’s official position on the backstop as she prepares to meet Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk in Brussels on Thursday.The amendment tabled by Conservative backbencher Graham Brady and backed by a majority of MPs last week called for “the Northern Ireland backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”. But the prime minister said in Belfast that “it would mean replacing the backstop with another arrangement which avoids a hard border or making legally binding changes to the backstop to introduce a time limit or create an exit mechanism”.Answering questions after her speech, May said she remained committed to an “insurance policy” to prevent a hard border and there was no question of a Brexit deal that did not include it.“I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that does not contain that insurance policy for the future. What parliament has said is that they believe there should be changes made to the backstop,” she said.Ministers and officials continue to meet the Conservative MPs behind the so-called Malthouse Compromise, which envisages replacing the backstop with a tariff-free trade area and technological and administrative measures to reduce customs friction. But the prime minister has now made clear she believes the House of Commons could approve her Brexit deal if the backstop is changed rather than replaced with “alternative arrangements”.Time limitBrussels and Dublin have ruled out reopening the text of the withdrawal agreement and have rejected proposals to include a time limit or a unilateral exit mechanism in the backstop. These proposals are unacceptable to the EU but they are negotiable, unlike the Malthouse ideas which are viewed on the European side as frankly ridiculous.DUP leader Arlene Foster on Tuesday signalled a willingness to be flexible, telling the BBC she would not insist the backstop should be removed from the withdrawal agreement.“I think it’s for the prime minister to negotiate in relation to these matters,” she said.Some of May’s own Brexiteer backbenchers will be less understanding if she appears to drop the Malthouse proposals and Downing Street insisted on Tuesday ministers were pursuing all three options - a time limit, an exit mechanism and “alternative arrangements” - with urgency.The prime minister cannot expect much comfort or encouragement from Juncker and Tusk, who will repeat that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation. But in stating that legally binding changes to the backstop would be enough to win a majority at Westminster she has moved her negotiating position back into the realm of the possible.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

sparking an international crisis - claims that up to 300,000 people face death if the aid is not delivered.You know there\u0027s a red line, you know well there\u0027s a limit, you know that medicines, food and medical supplies are that limit, lawmaker Miguel Pizarro said in a message to the military.Maduro, though, said humanitarian aid would be the forerunner of a US-led invasion, insisting that no one will enter, not one invading soldier.Police block a at street that leads to the US embassy during a protest against US intervention in Venezuela, in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaVenezuelan military officers used a tanker truck and huge shipping container to block access to the Tienditas bridge, which links Cucuta, Colombia to Urena, Venezuela.Franklyn Duarte, an opposition lawmaker from the border state of Tachira, told AFP that troops from the armed forces were blocking the crossing.The aid delivery was being coordinated by Guaido, who has declared himself interim president of the oil-rich country and now enjoys the backing of some 40 countries as Venezuela\u0027s legitimate leader.Maduro, 56, has repeatedly accused the United States of fomenting a coup.The US, which has not ruled out a military intervention in crisis-wracked Venezuela, was the first to recognize him as acting president, followed by a dozen Latin American countries.In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, President Donald Trump reaffirmed US support for Guaido, saying we stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom.Venezuela\u0026#39s President Maduro speaks during a meeting with representatives of the transport sector in CaracasBritain, France, Germany and Spain were among 20 EU nations to side with Guaido this week after Maduro ignored their demands that he announce new presidential elections by February 3Guaido is trying to force Maduro from power, set up a transitional government and hold a new presidential poll.He thanked his EU supporters for supporting all Venezuelans in this struggle we undertake to rescue our nation\u0027s democracy, freedom and justice.But key Maduro ally Russia slammed what it called interference in the oil-rich but now poor Latin American country, saying it was an attempt to legitimize usurped power.Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the EU of trying to topple the government by violence and ruse, while berating the US for treating Venezuela like one of your states.Guaido, 35, claims his legitimacy from the constitution and has been ramping up pressure on Maduro by calling his supporters out into the streets.The next mass demonstration is due for February 12.Guaido must still find a way to bring in the humanitarian aid given the military\u0027s loyalty to Maduro.He accused the military on Monday of planning to ert aid being stockpiled in Colombia, Brazil and an unidentified Caribbean island, in order to distribute it through the socialist government\u0027s subsidized food program for its own supporters.The National Assembly said the military must decide whether it is on the side of the people or the problem.Guaido knows he needs the armed forces on his side to dislodge Maduro. He was boosted on Saturday by the defection of a top air force general.His fledgling alternative administration will hold talks in Washington February 14 on responding to the largest hemispheric humanitarian crisis in modern history.Maduro disclosed on Monday that he sent Pope Francis a letter seeking help in mediating the country\u0027s crisis. The pope told journalists Tuesday that this would require agreement from both the government and the opposition.The United Nations said 40 people were killed in clashes with security forces in a week of protests last month, coinciding with Guaido\u0027s self-proclamation as acting leader. Local NGO Foro Penal said almost 1,000 people were detained between January 21 and 31.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Donald Tusk claims \u0026#39special place in hell\u0026#39 for Brexiteers as he rules out renegotiating backstopComment: Trump\u0026#39s centrist turn isn\u0026#39t surprising.

In 2005 he departed to vist the UK, and returned later that month.\u0026nbsp21 claims his legal status expired in 2006 through no fault of his own, and that he applied for a visa in 2017 after learning that he required one.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMr Abraham-Joseph has three US citizen children, a lawful permanent resident mother and four siblings that are either US citizens or lawful permanent residents, the statement continued.

DHS has known his address since the filing of a US visa application in 2017. He has never hidden from DHS or any of its agencies. Mr Abraham-Joseph is not subject to mandatory detention under federal law and is eligible for bond.By statute, bond should be granted by ICE when there is no flight risk or a danger to the community... we are unaware of why ICE apparently targeted MR Abraham-Jospeh, but we will do everything possible to legally seek his release and pursue his available relief in immigration court.At the time of the arrest, ICE claimed in a statement that 21 Savage “initially entered the US\u0026nbsplegally in July 2005, but subsequently failed to depart under the terms of his nonimmigrant visa and he became unlawfully present in the US\u0026nbspwhen his visa expired in July 2006.Created with Sketch.

She regularly appeared at its global launch events, and was often touted as a potential successor to Tim Cook.She had been paid millions of dollars to move to California from London to join Apple from Burberry. After her arrival, she led a major change in the way the stores worked, redesigning its businesses and moving towards seeing them as town halls.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut she will now be replaced by\u0026nbspDeirdre O’Brien, a longtime Apple executive who also runs the company’s human-resources department. Ahrendts will remain with Apple until April.\u0026nbspDuring her 30 years at Apple, O’Brien also helped gauge product demand. That issue has become a problem now that customers are holding onto their current iPhones longer instead of buying the latest models.

To lure her away, Apple gave Ahrendts company stock valued at $70 million in 2014. In her last full year at Apple, she received a compensation package valued at $26.5 million, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\u0026nbspAhrendts’ arrival at the Cupertino, California, company coincided with the rollout of the Apple Watch, which the company designed to be a fashion statement in addition to a wearable piece of technology.\u0026nbspWhile at Apple, Ahrendts engineered renovations of high-profiles stores in San Francisco, New York, Chicago and other cities in an attempt to transform them into hip places to hang out while shoppers checked out the company’s latest innovations. Her lofty description of the stores as the equivalent of “town squares” became the subject of derision among some analysts and media commentators.Additional reporting by Associated PressBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And few can have more first-hand experience of the danger posed to that progress by Brexit.This week, Nissan U-turned on its decision to build the new X-Trail at its Sunderland plant.\u0026nbspFor Matthews, who worked his way up from an apprenticeship to become managing director at a key Nissan supplier, it hit close to home.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbsp£61m package of taxpayer-funded sweeteners offered to Nissan by the government proved not to be enough to counter the financial reality of investing in post-Brexit\u0026nbspBritain, the shape of which remains deeply uncertain. Despite its earlier assurances, the company crunched the numbers and decided it now made sense\u0026nbspto build its\u0026nbspnew model in Japan instead.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I’m so disappointed for the plant,” says Matthews. “It’s such a pity.”Raised in Darlington, Matthews\u0026nbspdescribes himself as a “manufacturing guy through and through” with more than 30 years’ experience in the car industry.A toolmaker by trade, he is also one of the northeast’s most prominent business leaders, awarded an MBE in 2014 for the many years he has spent promoting the region.\u0026nbspWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?Before his resignation last month, he held the top job at\u0026nbspNifco, which designs and builds plastics components, and relies on Nissan for a quarter of its UK sales.In his view, the type of Brexit currently being pursued by Theresa May’s government damages the prospects not just for the UK’s biggest and most productive car factory but also the futures of tens of thousands of young people.“Nissan is such a fantastic organisation,” says Matthews. “What you don’t often hear about is the tens of thousands of people that Nissan has trained who have moved on and helped to build other companies.“As well as a car plant, they have become a talent factory. We need more companies like that in the UK because one of our biggest problems is a lack of skills. It is such a massive issue.”Created with Sketch. Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Matthews is a clear example of how the talent factory spreads opportunities far beyond Nissan’s walls and all along the sprawling supply chain down to smaller firms that support close to 40,000 jobs between them.\u0026nbspHis own career has grown alongside Nissan’s presence in Sunderland, a city that is home to some of the UK’s most deprived areas. His apprenticeship at Nifco began\u0026nbspshortly after Nissan opened up its UK plant to great fanfare in 1986.Back then, Nissan had grown rapidly in its home market and sought to export the Japanese car industry’s hyper-efficient, just-in-time manufacturing model to Europe. Now that process is in danger of going into reverse.The Sunderland plant built 5,000 cars in its first year and employed 500 people. With the new X-Trail, that was to have grown to more than 600,000 cars and more than 7,000 employees.\u0026nbspSunderland was to have become, in Nissan’s words, a “super-plant”.The X-Trail decision may make little long-term difference to Nissan, which has plants all over the world. But its smaller suppliers across the northeast will forgo future growth much-needed jobs will not be created money will not be invested.Created with Sketch.

But now it’s part of the scene, part of the view, part of the experience of walking up High Street West into town. It’s tiny and anonymous, but noticeable and affectingThree elements of the city: a flapping pigeon an austere grey tower block purchasable sexNo one will lose their\u0026nbspjobs\u0026nbspas a direct result of this decision but it provides a clue to the behaviour of international car companies post-Brexit.Car models have their natural life-cycle which is likely to be several years, explains Richard Wilding, professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield School of Management. Towards the end of these cycles\u0026nbspdecisions are made about the production of the next iteration.He points out that more investment decisions will be made as models reach the end of their lives, meaning that the full impact of Brexit on manufacturing will not be known for some time. At this point it\u0026nbspis simple enough for a global company to choose one of its other sites.Japan’s freshly inked free trade deal with the EU means that by 2027 its car exports into the world’s largest single market will face zero tariffs compared to the 10 per cent the UK will face.Nissan is not alone. Jaguar Land Rover last year announced it would transfer production of the Discovery from the West Midlands to Slovakia, which, being\u0026nbspinside the EU, has tariff-free access.Just as opportunity cascades down the supply chain so does the negative impact of decisions like these, a fact which Matthews is keenly aware of.\u0026nbspIt’s been more than two years since Nissan announced it would make the X-Trail in Sunderland and many companies will have built their businesses and their sales forecasts around the decision, he says.“Now they will have gaps in their manufacturing that they have to fill somehow, which will be a huge challenge. They will have to look to other manufacturers.”That will of course prove difficult as other firms,\u0026nbspincluding JLR\u0026nbspand Ford, have scaled back their workforces in the UK amid continuing uncertainty not just around Brexit but diesel emissions too.Going the other way up the supply chain, the Port of Tyne’s chief executive Matthew Beeton is concerned by Nissan’s decision. The lack of clarity around Brexit means it “remains difficult to plan and invest for in the medium to long term – impacting on ... ports, business and indeed the wider economic position both regionally and nationally”,\u0026nbsphe said.Despite the risks, Matthews understands why many shop floor workers still want to leave the EU and he insists that the UK’s decision to do so must be respected.“I’ve spoken to a lot of people on the shop floor. Many\u0026nbspof them want to come out of the EU regardless.“They are very frustrated with our relationship with Europe. The majority of those on the shop floor want to leave.“The\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspwho are faced with managing global businesses take a different view.”He blames the EU for the current\u0026nbsplack of certainty on Brexit as much\u0026nbspas the UK government.\u0026nbsp“I voted remain and I have been very open about that but I also respect democracy. To protect manufacturing we need some form of customs union, but not at any cost.“The way we have been treated by the EU in the negotiations has led to an\u0026nbspincrease in nationalist tendencies that is causing big rifts that will still be here 10, 20, 30 years down the line.”Ministers condemned for hiding £61m aid package for NissanIn the more immediate term, Brexit is due to go ahead next month and manufacturers\u0026nbspare still a long way short of being ready.“How can you prepare when you don’t know what you are preparing for? We are coming out in a matter of weeks and we still don’t know.”The kind of just-in-time manufacturing operated by the UK car industry requires companies having stock on hand, Matthews explains. “But companies don’t know the lead times that they’re going to face after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“How can any business plan for that? It is a nightmare.”A lot of firms are building up stocks as much as they can to prepare for no deal but the other side of that is they spend a huge amount of money on warehousing which may have been wasted, says Matthews.With all of these problems to face, will other manufacturers follow Nissan and JLR by starting to shift production of certain models elsewhere?Matthews won’t be drawn.“If we come out of the EU and secure some kind of customs union that will be very good news for UK manufacturing,” says Matthews. “But I don’t have a crystal ball.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iqbal Wahhab hopes to change thatClick to followThe IndependentIn 2015 former Royal Scots Dragoon Guard Alex Matheson set up a breakfast cereal business called FUEL10KIt’s minus 15 degrees in Kosovo at the height of its tensions with Serbia.Twenty four year old Alex Matheson, serving in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, is part of a Nato mission that has been sent to the Serbian border.A horde of Kosovans are seeking to break and enter Serbia, where they hear that one of their group has been held. The Serbian guard commanders say they will open fire if they do. It’s Alex’s first operation and his group is vastly outnumbered on either side and so can’t physically drive the warring factions apart.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Over 48 hours we had to persuade the Kosovans not to attempt a border break and the Serbians not to shoot,” he says. “I had my troops and the Serbians looking to me. I had to keep strong. I had to keep alert and focus on the end result.”The Serbians didn’t shoot and the Kosovans retreated, teaching him the importance of keeping calm which probably isn’t taught in business studies courses but really should be.After seven years of service, which included further tours of Macedonia and Iraq, Alex returned to his native Inverness and in 2015 set up a breakfast cereal business called FUEL10K, hoping to capitalise on the trend among younger customers to ditch conventional square boxed options.His 32-strong product range includes drinks in squeezable pouches, porridge pots and cookies and are stocked in Tesco, Asda, Sainsburys and Waitrose. Every year has seen double digit growth with sales now at £8m this year and expected to hit £10m next, all from a standing start and no outside investment. Last year he was named Entrepreneur of the Year by Heropreneurs, an organisation encouraging armed forces veterans to go into business on return to civilian life.The encouraging reality of corporate social responsibilityIt’s often said we can judge a country by how well it treats its prisoners. But how we treat our veterans is equally revealing, perhaps more so, given around 4 per cent of the prison population is made up of ex-military.Alex’s journey is a remarkable one, sadly not shared by many. Having worked with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress for a number of years, I’ve heard too many stories of returning servicemen being unprepared to come back to what they left often many years ago, beginning a cycle of family breakdown, homelessness, alcoholism, drugs, crime and imprisonment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) means for many their only weekly activity is a counselling session.Sometimes crime and homelessness are ing factors to join the armed forces in the first place.“By the time I joined the army aged 21, I had lived on the streets aged 16, ran my first business, been on the run from the police for defrauding banks and catalogues, done drugs and employed a drug dealer,” Nick Wilson tells me.In the army he found he had a family who always looked out for each other. But in 2013, on return, he set up a chauffeur company which, while successful, left him with the feeling that many business owners face of isolation: “What got me through the really bad times was that sense of survival – knowing real hard times, horrendous, shit situations experienced whilst on operational tour, those that put life in perspective. The gritted, dogged determination that you needed to get through those days, weeks, months is what will get you through business.”After two years Nick sold his business for a profit just around the time he was diagnosed with PTSD. “I was having suicidal thoughts, the pain from my spinal injury was becoming a real problem with the meds and their side-effects causing me to lose grip on reality.”In 2016 he suffered a nervous breakdown but after rehabilitation was determined not to let mental health issues ruin his life. He set up Working Minds Matter – a consultancy firm helping business with mental wellbeing in the workplace.“I think it is important for a veteran who is looking to go into business for themselves to have a better understanding of who they are as a person, what makes them who they are, their values, their beliefs, their strengths and weaknesses. They are no longer a part of a large family unit, having to follow another leader or manager, working for an organisation’s values and beliefs rather than those of their own.”I first met Nick at an event Dragons Den star Peter Jones organised last summer at Buckingham University where 20 businesspeople speed mentored hundreds of schoolkids from around the country who all had entrepreneurial dreams.Our collective worry was that the education system would slowly sap that out of them. I observed\u0026nbspto Nick was that the army instils leadership skills and\u0026nbspI was surprised that there weren’t more veteran-owned businesses.Nick\u0026nbspthen put out a competition to his network to a make a short video presentation of their emerging or aspirant business idea and the most compelling one would win a year’s mentoring with me.Created with Sketch.The new army recruitment posters Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The winner, Rob Dennison, joined the army in 2004, serving partly in Afghanistan. He still has recurring nightmares from when he visited the Helmand Province where he came across a child prostitution racket with many children lying dead. “When I returned I realised I’d gone from a high adrenalin career to nothing,” he says.He told his girlfriend that once he’d got into trouble for brewing some coffee when out on patrol and she convinced him to start his own coffee business which he’s called The 50cal Coffee Company. It will be a social enterprise – a series of cafes where veterans can not only get his own blends and brews but also have the opportunity to talk to someone in private about the problems they are facing, starting in his home town of Lincoln.In America there is much bigger public support for veterans and veteran-owned businesses than we have here. I’m hoping my year with Rob will help him get off the ground and get wider buy-in from the rest of us.It’s not just about what people like Alex, Nick and Rob have done for us in their past in the services but also for what they are able to do for us in the next phase of their lives.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And few can have more first-hand experience of the danger posed to that progress by Brexit.This week, Nissan U-turned on its decision to build the new X-Trail at its Sunderland plant.\u0026nbspFor Matthews, who worked his way up from an apprenticeship to become managing director at a key Nissan supplier, it hit close to home.\u0026nbspA\u0026nbsp£61m package of taxpayer-funded sweeteners offered to Nissan by the government proved not to be enough to counter the financial reality of investing in post-Brexit\u0026nbspBritain, the shape of which remains deeply uncertain. Despite its earlier assurances, the company crunched the numbers and decided it now made sense\u0026nbspto build its\u0026nbspnew model in Japan instead.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“I’m so disappointed for the plant,” says Matthews. “It’s such a pity.”Raised in Darlington, Matthews\u0026nbspdescribes himself as a “manufacturing guy through and through” with more than 30 years’ experience in the car industry.A toolmaker by trade, he is also one of the northeast’s most prominent business leaders, awarded an MBE in 2014 for the many years he has spent promoting the region.\u0026nbspWas Brexit behind Nissan’s decision not to build the X-Trail here?Before his resignation last month, he held the top job at\u0026nbspNifco, which designs and builds plastics components, and relies on Nissan for a quarter of its UK sales.In his view, the type of Brexit currently being pursued by Theresa May’s government damages the prospects not just for the UK’s biggest and most productive car factory but also the futures of tens of thousands of young people.“Nissan is such a fantastic organisation,” says Matthews. “What you don’t often hear about is the tens of thousands of people that Nissan has trained who have moved on and helped to build other companies.“As well as a car plant, they have become a talent factory. We need more companies like that in the UK because one of our biggest problems is a lack of skills. It is such a massive issue.”Created with Sketch. Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Matthews is a clear example of how the talent factory spreads opportunities far beyond Nissan’s walls and all along the sprawling supply chain down to smaller firms that support close to 40,000 jobs between them.\u0026nbspHis own career has grown alongside Nissan’s presence in Sunderland, a city that is home to some of the UK’s most deprived areas. His apprenticeship at Nifco began\u0026nbspshortly after Nissan opened up its UK plant to great fanfare in 1986.Back then, Nissan had grown rapidly in its home market and sought to export the Japanese car industry’s hyper-efficient, just-in-time manufacturing model to Europe. Now that process is in danger of going into reverse.The Sunderland plant built 5,000 cars in its first year and employed 500 people. With the new X-Trail, that was to have grown to more than 600,000 cars and more than 7,000 employees.\u0026nbspSunderland was to have become, in Nissan’s words, a “super-plant”.The X-Trail decision may make little long-term difference to Nissan, which has plants all over the world. But its smaller suppliers across the northeast will forgo future growth much-needed jobs will not be created money will not be invested.Created with Sketch.

It’s tiny and anonymous, but noticeable and affectingThree elements of the city: a flapping pigeon an austere grey tower block purchasable sexNo one will lose their\u0026nbspjobs\u0026nbspas a direct result of this decision but it provides a clue to the behaviour of international car companies post-Brexit.Car models have their natural life-cycle which is likely to be several years, explains Richard Wilding, professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield School of Management. Towards the end of these cycles\u0026nbspdecisions are made about the production of the next iteration.He points out that more investment decisions will be made as models reach the end of their lives, meaning that the full impact of Brexit on manufacturing will not be known for some time. At this point it\u0026nbspis simple enough for a global company to choose one of its other sites.Japan’s freshly inked free trade deal with the EU means that by 2027 its car exports into the world’s largest single market will face zero tariffs compared to the 10 per cent the UK will face.Nissan is not alone. Jaguar Land Rover last year announced it would transfer production of the Discovery from the West Midlands to Slovakia, which, being\u0026nbspinside the EU, has tariff-free access.Just as opportunity cascades down the supply chain so does the negative impact of decisions like these, a fact which Matthews is keenly aware of.\u0026nbspIt’s been more than two years since Nissan announced it would make the X-Trail in Sunderland and many companies will have built their businesses and their sales forecasts around the decision, he says.“Now they will have gaps in their manufacturing that they have to fill somehow, which will be a huge challenge. They will have to look to other manufacturers.”That will of course prove difficult as other firms,\u0026nbspincluding JLR\u0026nbspand Ford, have scaled back their workforces in the UK amid continuing uncertainty not just around Brexit but diesel emissions too.Going the other way up the supply chain, the Port of Tyne’s chief executive Matthew Beeton is concerned by Nissan’s decision. The lack of clarity around Brexit means it “remains difficult to plan and invest for in the medium to long term – impacting on ... ports, business and indeed the wider economic position both regionally and nationally”,\u0026nbsphe said.Despite the risks, Matthews understands why many shop floor workers still want to leave the EU and he insists that the UK’s decision to do so must be respected.“I’ve spoken to a lot of people on the shop floor. Many\u0026nbspof them want to come out of the EU regardless.“They are very frustrated with our relationship with Europe. The majority of those on the shop floor want to leave.“The\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspwho are faced with managing global businesses take a different view.”He blames the EU for the current\u0026nbsplack of certainty on Brexit as much\u0026nbspas the UK government.\u0026nbsp“I voted remain and I have been very open about that but I also respect democracy. To protect manufacturing we need some form of customs union, but not at any cost.“The way we have been treated by the EU in the negotiations has led to an\u0026nbspincrease in nationalist tendencies that is causing big rifts that will still be here 10, 20, 30 years down the line.”Ministers condemned for hiding £61m aid package for NissanIn the more immediate term, Brexit is due to go ahead next month and manufacturers\u0026nbspare still a long way short of being ready.“How can you prepare when you don’t know what you are preparing for? We are coming out in a matter of weeks and we still don’t know.”The kind of just-in-time manufacturing operated by the UK car industry requires companies having stock on hand, Matthews explains. “But companies don’t know the lead times that they’re going to face after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“How can any business plan for that? It is a nightmare.”A lot of firms are building up stocks as much as they can to prepare for no deal but the other side of that is they spend a huge amount of money on warehousing which may have been wasted, says Matthews.With all of these problems to face, will other manufacturers follow Nissan and JLR by starting to shift production of certain models elsewhere?Matthews won’t be drawn.“If we come out of the EU and secure some kind of customs union that will be very good news for UK manufacturing,” says Matthews. “But I don’t have a crystal ball.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are major differentials.”Meanwhile, tenants in Manchester pay an average rent of £496, against £1,053 in the capital. One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Choose from Public, Friends, Only Me and Custom in the dropdown menu.Annoyingly, changing this has no effect on who’s able to see your past Facebook posts. Instead, on the Privacy page, you have to click on Limit Past Posts, then select Limit Old Posts and finally hit Confirm on the pop-up.39 Make yourself harder to findYou can stop completely random people from adding you by selecting Friends of Friends from the dropdown menu in the Who can send you friend requests? section of the Privacy page. It’s also worth limiting who can find your Facebook profile with your number and email address. 49 Control access to your TimelineYou can limit who gets to post things on your Timeline and who gets to see posts on your Timeline too. In Settings, go to Timeline and Tagging and edit the sections you want to lock down. When you block someone, they won’t be able to see things you post on your Timeline, tag you, invite you to events or groups, start conversations with you or add you as a friend. To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline. They’ll still be visible on the News Feed while they’re fresh, but won’t be tied to your profile forever. In Timeline and Tagging, enable Timeline review controls. 79 Clean up your appsYou can view a list of all of the apps you’ve connected to your Facebook account by going to Settings and Apps. The list might be longer than you expected it to be. It’s worth tidying this up to ensure things you no longer use lose access to your personal information. 89 Change your ad preferencesYou can view a list of everything Facebook thinks you’re into and tinker with your ad preferences by going to Settings and Adverts. A lot more information is displayed on the desktop site than the app, so we’d recommend doing this on a computer.99 Download your dataFacebook lets you download all of the data it has on you, including the posts you’ve shared, your messages and photos, ads you’ve clicked on and even the IP addresses that are logged when you log in or out of the site.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Debate in the European parliament is a joke. Neither system is perfect, but they can learn from each other, writes Jon Stone\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentFarage and Jean-Claude Juncker: the former Ukip leader is a master of the grandstand-to-viral-video formulaThis is not the House of Commons, this is the European parliament.” These were the words deputy speaker Mairead McGuinness used on Wednesday to tell off former Ukip MEPs shouting down another member during a debate in Brussels.The Brexit crisis has put the House of Commons in the international spotlight more than ever, and the chamber ides opinion. To some like McGuiness, the Commons’ boisterous atmosphere and over-the-top shouting is a sign that MPs do not take things things seriously. It is criticised as being an archaic, hostile environment that disadvantages anyone who doesn’t take a macho approach to politics – often women.Others speak highly of the drama of Britain’s mother of parliaments and sigh wearily at the dour debates in other legislatures like the European parliament. Many foreign observers who watch the Commons for the first time are captivated. An amazed American friend once genuinely asked me whether he was watching footage “from a movie”. Prime minister’s questions features regularly on US political channel C-Span and makes far more appearances there than any other foreign legislature – because it is so watchable.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI covered Westminster for years and made the jump to Brussels in 2017. I arrived with high expectations of the European parliament, expecting a modern legislature that was rationally designed rather than evolved through the centuries. Not every expectation was met: after a year and a half of working in the EU capital I believe Brussels is better than Westminster in some respects – but worse in others.Let’s start with the bad: what passes for “debate” in Brussels is a joke, and beyond awful. In Westminster the format for asking questions to a minister is designed to put them on the ropes – they get quizzed by their opposition counterpart and have to give an answer immediately after they are asked. Then there are follow-ups. Backbenchers can raise questions afterwards. If the minister doesn’t give good answers, they look stupid or evasive. It is not uncommon for answers to be newsworthy sometimes unintentionally.Drop Brexit red lines to ‘avoid backstop’, EU parliament to urgeNot so in Brussels: first, MEPs ask their questions. Then, after all the questions have been asked, the commissioner does a single summing up speech in response where he picks the questions he likes and pretends uncomfortable ones didn’t exist. There is practically zero scrutiny applied, and the system incentivises MEPs to do a piece of grandstanding to camera, so their clip can be shared on Facebook later and get 17 likes.\u0026nbspSome MEPs are better at exploiting this dynamic than others. Pro-Europeans in the UK would do well to remember that it was the European parliament, not Westminster, that gave Nigel Farage his platform to rail against the EU. The former Ukip leader is a master at the grandstand-to-viral-video formula: one extended clip of him insulting former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy (“You have all the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk.”) is perhaps the single most popular clip in the history of the Parliament. It has several million views across dozens of different uploads on YouTube and other streaming sites and made Farage an overnight celebrity across the world – catching the eyes of US news channels where he is now a regular fixture and an ally of Donald Trump.Created with Sketch.The Royal Gallery, Houses of Parliament — in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery Queen Elizabeth II  is accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as they proceed through the Royal Gallery before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster in 2014.The Royal Gallery during the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsChina\u0027s President, Xi Jinping addresses MPs and peers in Parliament\u0027s Royal Gallery in 2015.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivers a speech in the Royal Gallery in the Houses of Parliament as Britain\u0027s Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow listens Yeoman of the Guard, wearing traditional uniform walk through the Royal Gallery during the ceremonial search before the State Opening of Parliament in the House of LordsIndia\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses members of parliament and invited guests in the Royal Gallery at the Houses of Parliamen in 2015.Furious rhetoric has become a cottage industry: other typical video titles include “‘Who the Hell do you Think You Are?’ Nigel Farage throws egg in Eurocrat faces”, “Nigel Farage: I want you all fired!” and “‘You Are a TERRIBLE Leader’ – Nigel Farage Tells Angela Merkel Everything To Her Face”. In some ways the dynamic of the parliament’s broken debates has undermined the European project itself and allowed shouty populists to differentiate themselves in a field where reasoned debate is always overshadowed by grandstanding.EU rules Gibraltar is ‘colony’ of BritainEU agrees to give UK visa-free travel even after no-deal BrexitJeremy Hardy’s best jokes: From Brexit to right wing hypocrisySenior Conservative latest to admit Brexit could be delayedThe minimal time allocated for debates in Brussels is also a serious problem that prevents serious discussion. Often, only the leaders of the European parliament’s political groups get time to speak – backbenchers are often omitted altogether, even on big issues. When regular MEPs do get a word in, it will only be a handful of them. Even the group leaders are regularly told by the chair to hurry up – we don’t have all day. A massive basketball-style clock with red lettering looms over MEPs telling them how much speaking time they have used.\u0026nbspThis is unforgiveable, and it need not be this\u0026nbspway. The limited speaking time is a function of the fact the parliament barely sits – the main chamber is usually in use for around four days a month, with occasional extra “extraordinary” sessions lasting two days. The Commons, by contrast, sits over twice as many days – even though MPs tend to have more intensive constituency duties than MEPs do. It would be easy to find more time for proper debates if only the parliament actually met more regularly.Westminster has its fair share of ridiculous spectacles: mock hostage-taking during the state opening of parliament, £80,000 animal skin parchments, and the magic mace (don’t pick it up!). But none of these traditions are as bizarre and disruptive as the monthly caravan of MEPs and their staff marching from Brussels to Strasbourg. For the unfamiliar: the European Parliament’s main offices are in Belgium’s capital, but because of a historical quirk and a whole lot of politics, it conducts most of its main sessions in France. To give you an idea of how sensible this is, the transport infrastructure between the cities is so poor that the fastest way is actually to go on the train via Paris (the parliament, in fact charters special TGVs from the French national railway company for some staff). If you’ve ever looked at a map you’ll appreciate that this makes no sense: Paris is 400km from Strasbourg, and not in the right direction.France has an effective veto on ending the practice, and even Emmanuel Macron, for all his alleged reforming zeal, wants to keep it. The situation is so inconvenient that the parliament’s secretariat actually offers to pay expenses for journalists to come to Strasbourg to encourage some to show up. It is, at least, a lovely city – certainly worth a visit or 12.It should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from itIt should be clear that the European parliament is absolutely not the ideal legislature of some British pro-Europeans’ imaginations. And yet, there is a lot that Westminster could learn from it.\u0026nbspThe overall EU legislative process is notoriously long and convoluted, but the legislative scrutiny the parliament provides is generally very good: independent committees of MEPs and rapporteurs scrutinise laws coming from the commission and council, and all MEPs get a binding vote on their recommended changes, which are often substantial and well thought-out. Elections by proportional representation mean the commission presidency never really has an absolute single-party majority and the law-making process is genuinely consensual – it is harder to railroad through legislation than in the UK.\u0026nbspSome of the nuts and bolts of how the European parliament works are also very impressive to someone used to the 16th century practises still operating in the Commons. MEPs vote electronically, which means it takes about 10 seconds to process a vote. In Westminster a single amendment will take 15 minutes because all 650 MPs have to physically go and stand in a room together to be counted: the present system of having two ision lobbies dates back to 1835 but a similar system, which used only one lobby, dates back to at least 1584.You might think that the fact MEPs speak dozens of different languages from 28 countries would be a problem, but this is actually dealt with very well. The translation set-up is practically one of the wonders of the modern world – everyone can talk and listen to everyone else in their native language. Sometimes MEPs choose to speak in English: some are better than others, and the language barrier makes genuinely inspiring rhetoric sparse, though some does occasionally shine through.What will happen to Britain’s MEPs if Brexit is delayed?What Britain’s last ever MEPs are planning to do after BrexitIn many respects the European parliament is also far more open than Westminster. If you want to report on the House of Commons in person as a journalist, you need to be a member of the press gallery. This requires a parliamentary security pass, of which there are a limited number for journalists, with a set allocation for established publications. It is hard to get one, they are jealously guarded, and the whole system is very much a closed shop.\u0026nbspIn Brussels anyone who can prove they are a bone fide journalist can get a pass that gives them access to the EU institutions: a letter from your editor and samples of work will do. This thankfully made it easy for The Independent to set up shop here, but it also means there are far more freelancers, upstart publications, and smaller specialist outfits catering to interested audiences. Given the technical nature of a lot of legislation the EU deals with, having specialists on hand is crucial: it’s good for scrutiny, and it’s good for democracy. There has been some movement in the UK to allow new publications into the press gallery, but the issue is contentious and the process of who is allowed in is not always transparent.\u0026nbspSpecialist reporters are usually confined to newsrooms for lack of parliamentary passes – while in Brussels agricultural subsidy specialists wander the halls freely with financial services reporters and health policy correspondents.Created with Sketch.

This is not the case in Brussels: because of the way the EU is set up, the parliament plays second – or even third – fiddle to the European Commission and European Council, which are a short walk away and where most journalists congregate. The most important daily press briefing in Brussels happens at the commission, in an auditorium, on camera – while in Westminster it is done in an obscure wood-panelled room, up too many staircases, on semi-anonymous terms.\u0026nbspThe European parliament has gained more powers and importance in recent years, but it cannot yet claim to be a fully-fledged legislature – notably it lacks the ability to actually suggest laws known as legislative initiative. But in practice in Westminster there is little legislative initiative from the backbenches anyway: the UK’s broken private members’ bill system, where practically every law is talked out or “filibustered” even if there is a majority for it, means that the government has a very firm grip on the statute book indeed.Some differences between Westminster and Brussels are a matter of taste: Westminster, notably, sits in a gothic palace, while the parliament buildings in Brussels and Strasbourg are modern glass, steel, and concrete – both styles have their fans and detractors. In one way, though, the two places are more similar than they might like to admit: it notably is very easy to get lost in both, thanks to a shared history of repeated extensions, badly connected annexes, and endless nondescript corridors.There is no really answer to which parliament is better: they can both learn from each other. And really, they both need to.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen.

I know that there are a lot of shows that have been rebooted lately, but we are not on that path.“Independent Minds Q\u0026ampA session on the Middle East, Trump, Syria and IsisCuse wrote Lost alongside co-creator Damon Lindelof until its series finale in 2010. Lindelof went on to oversee HBO’s little-seen standout The Leftovers which drew to a conclusion in 2017 after a season many hailed as one of the greatest in recent memory. He’ll next tackle an adaptation of Watchmen for the premium cable service.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are major differentials.”Meanwhile, tenants in Manchester pay an average rent of £496, against £1,053 in the capital. One chart that shows why Londoners are the poorest workers in the UKLondon is over. I\u0027m so glad I leftRenters are leaving London in record numbers. Where are they going?A new survey has revealed what Britons hate the most about LondonThe cost of living in every part of the world in one infographicThe ‘Northern pound’ is “essentially a difference in the cost of living”, Mr Johnes said, and the fact that money goes further outside the capital explains why more than half (53 per cent) of Londoners said they would move away from the city and accept a lower salary elsewhere, while just 31 per cent in the North said they would consider moving. This benefits both jobseekers and employers, Mr Johnes said, because companies will find it easier to hire staff and workers will find their money goes further, even if they are being paid a smaller amount. “So it’s a win for consumers and a win for businesses,” he said. Martin Talbot, director at Totaljobs, added: “Gone are the days where a salary is enough to secure the best talent today’s jobseekers are increasingly valuing work-life balance and their wellbeing above all else. “Northern cities are seeing a rise in job opportunities as UK companies no longer think the capital is the be all and end all. Many northern cities offer lots of other advantages too, from a shorter (and cheaper) commute, great cultural scene, and a more affordable social life. “No matter where they’re based, it’s key for businesses to highlight not just their employer brand, but the lifestyle their local area can provide existing and potential employees.”However, the researchers noted that London is unlikely to be abandoned by UK workers. “London will be fine, London is still a great place to live. It has been and will continue to be a centre of gravity,” said Mr Johnes. The survey also revealed that Londoners have different priorities for spending, with 16 per cent of people living in the city taking five or more holidays per year, compared with 9 per cent in the North.cost of livingOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Thus, the post-crash recession of 2008 was less severe than it might have been.Under the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, the UK and Denmark were the\u0026nbsponly EU member states relieved of the requirement to join the euro once certain economic conditions were in place, for example on government borrowing and inflation (the “convergence criteria”).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThat treaty was eventually subsumed into the Lisbon Treaty of 2007. The European Commission states: “The treaty does not specify a particular timetable for joining the euro area, but leaves it to member states to develop their own strategies for meeting the condition for euro adoption. Seven of the 13 member states who joined the EU since 2004 have already joined the euro area, most recently Lithuania on 1 January 2015.” The UK and Denmark’s “opt-outs” are still in force.The question now arises, then, of whether this special situation would continue of the Brexit process, under article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, were now paused or revoked (ie reversed).What’s behind the latest Brexit row over Gibraltar?The short answer to that is yes. The UK would remain, as now, a member state under existing terms. Including the euro opt-out.However, if the UK were to formally leave the EU at any point, even under a “soft Brexit” and remaining in the European Economic Area, the single market or customs union, it would still need to reapply for membership in the usual fashion if it wanted to return. Just as, say, Albania or Serbia are now, the UK would become a “candidate” for accession.This would require acceptance of the “acquis communautaire” – all the rules, regulations and laws of the EU as they currently stand. Any exceptions would have to be agreed by the EU.Created with Sketch.

There the Bank of England would be represented along with the other central banks.In due course, when the convergence criteria had been met, the UK would then join the euro and abolish the pound, first in bank deposits and then in notes and coins. However, it is interesting that Sweden maintains that it is not obliged to join the euro, and would only do so after a referendum. It has been an EU member since 1994 and still uses the krona.The UK joining the euro would be a controversial question, as it was when it was a live issue in the 1990s.If history is any guide, and with acknowledged flaws in the eurozone’s governance, joining the euro would be a significant obstacle to the UK rejoining the EU, if the EU insisted on enforcing it. Critics would claim it would mean bailing out Greece or Italy at great costs. Supporters would point to how it would make cross-border trade and price transparency much easier.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But if we are able to make progress sooner, then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”There is\u0026nbspgrowing concern\u0026nbspamong ministers that there is not enough time to pass the necessary legislation before exit day,\u0026nbspamid reports that the February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had “not been properly worked up” to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop – which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bid to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith “alternative arrangements” in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles –\u0026nbspno one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging –\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”However his Austrian counterpart, Karin Kneissl, said it would be “very difficult” for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: “According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn’t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it’s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough – a magic solution – in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.”Created with Sketch.

The opposite is our legal view.”However, the day before May lost her ‘meaningful vote’ a Gibraltar government spokesman said: “Gibraltar has been making plans for a ‘no deal’ scenario.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tories need to show they’re above that.We don’t agree with much of Nick Boles’s plan for a Brexit so soft as to be barely Brexit at all.

The Tory party has always been a broad church and it serves as a better party of government when pragmatism is its guiding force.For the first time in months, the Conservatives have shown the sort of professionalism and unity that the public expects of them.They must keep it together.IT is an outrage that speedboat killer Jack Shepherd continues to claim legal aid despite refusing toto Britain.Justice Secretary David Gauke cannot simply put his hands in the air and claim he’s powerless to do anything.Everybody has a right to a fair trial, and that often means help with legal costs. But how anybody on the run can be entitled to taxpayers’ cash is absolutely beyond us.Gauke has form for dodging tough decisions. His plans to reform Parole Board transparency in the wake of the John Worboys fiasco are still in a holding pattern.He has been renowned as a safe pair of hands for years.That reputation is rapidly disintegrating.A STONED teenager drives his parents’ Audi and kills two people — weeks after being stopped for suspected drug-driving.You’d probably expect the lout to spend some time at Her Maj’s pleasure. You’d at least expect him to be charged with manslaughter, or death by dangerous driving.But no.

So why lie Some people have been asking this weekjail is the best punishment for a speeding fine. But let’s be clear: She is not going to prison for speeding — she is going to prison for perverting the course of justice by lying about who was driving her car.That would be bad enough for an average citizen. But Onasanya is not an average citizen. She is a solicitor — and also an MP.An MP is known by the title ­“Honourable” for a reason: There is a code of conduct outlined for MPs which includes, among other things, integrity and honesty.Any MP has even more obligation than the average person to set a good example and to take responsibility for their actions — both of which she has failed, spectacularly, to do. She has acted asshe is above the law, which is simply not acceptable for someone whose job is to uphold the law.She no longer deserves the privilege of representing anyone in the legal or parliamentary system and it is clear to any right-thinking ­person that she should be struck off as a solicitor — and resign as an MP.It is her refusal to do this immediately which is the most astonishing thing about this story.That, plus Corbyn’s lack of ­leadership in not insisting she resign as soon as she was found guilty.By all accounts, it sounds like she was out of her depth as an MP from the get go. For a start, constituents complained she was uncontactable.She also spent £, of taxpayer’s money in seven months on “expenses” and was caught on video ­pretending to snort “cocaine”, which isn’t exactly a great look for an MP.The trial judge concluded the “truth comes a very distant second to your personal ambition, doesn’t it ”Whether or not that’s true, it is hard not to conclude, in the face of the evidence against her, that her refusal to resign as an MP is rooted in the £, salary it yields.But how is she going to help her constituents from prison One argument being made about her being sent to jail is that she is clearly not a danger to society, which is true. But the problem for the courts is thatyou take an oath to tell the truth, then fail to do so, it has to be considered a serious offence — and punished accordingly.Without a deterrent to stop people lying through their teeth, the justice system would collapse.Let’s face it, there is nothing about this story that makes Onasanya look good.She is going to have an ­electronic tag when she comes out.No doubt she is massively regretting not owning up to speeding in the first place — and taking the consequences.Her le is now in tatters.But resigning as an MP now might help her claw back a tiny bit of respect for finally doing the right thing. As a solicitor and an MP, she needs to take full responsibility for her actions.IT’S shocking that Bonita Baxter, a heavily pregnant woman with a serious heart condition, was forced to sit on an AE floor at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for five hours after patients and visitors refused to give up their seats.Clearly, manners are no longer important to this nation.But the real issue is that the hospital was so overcrowded that, given the five-hour wait, no one was going to give up their seat.AE departments continue to be overcrowded in part because we continue to abuse the NHS, turning up to AE for anything from drunkenness to a broken fingernail.Anyone who has ever had to pay for their healthcare, as they do in North America, would respect our health service much, much more.In the meantime, we need to put measures in place to make sure that people start valuing what they have.There should be fines for people who don’t attend GP and hospital appointments.And AE should start turning away anything other than genuine emergencies.T’S heart-breaking, isn’t it, ­listening to Vicky Pattison blaming herself for the fact her fiancé, John Noble, had “grown close to” other women during a boys’ trip to Dubai “When something like this happens, you blame yourself and I did question myself. MaybeI was thinner he wouldn’t have done what he did,” she said on TV on Wednesday.Apparently, this charmer actually blamed her – and her size – saying that he was “set up” to cheat because of it. Vicky, darling,you are reading this: It’s not your fault he cheated. And no amount of dieting would have stopped him.A cheater’s always going to cheat.You need to take some time out to focus on yourself and decide not to be around people who make you feel bad about yourself. There is so much pressure on women today.There is so much emphasis on how they look and how other people see them, rather than a focus on real values, like the size of your brain.So I suppose it’s easy to understand how Vicky concluded that her appearance might be the “problem”.When the reality is just that she picked an a***hole to go out with.I ABHOR fat-shaming, and rudeness. And I have zero sympathy for the woman who refused to sit between two overweight passengers on a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to New York.She caused a horrible scene and loudly called them “big pigs”, which is truly shocking.But luckily the shame was all hers, as her tirade went viral on social media – and she was thrown off the flight.It’s also true thatyou book a flight then you are entitled to the seat you’ve booked, andsomeone is taking up half of yours that’s not fair.But this issue should be dealt with by the airline, not passengers.Many airlines have an “obesity policy”. American Airlines, for example, requires passengers to purchase a second seatthey need a seatbelt extension and their body “extends more than one inch beyond the outermost edge of the arm rest”.I can imagine it’s a dficult and embarrassing rule to enforce – but it’s better than people taking matters into their ownhands.For once, I can say I did not stray, not even so much as once.THE Europeans screaming that the Irish backstop must remain are deluded.No Deal will affect Europe as much as – and in some cases, more than – the UK.And when the French farmers realise they can’t get their cheese across the border before it rots, and the Spanish – who sell more goods and services to the UK than it buys – are stranded with decaying goods, and when German car sales slump because tarfs make them too expensive, I predict riots across Europe.And then Michael Barnier will have a small dose of the pain he has inflicted on our PM.The reality is that citizens of these European countries, whose jobs will be under threat by No Deal, will not give a hootthere is or isn’t a hard border in Ireland.And frankly, all companies collect VAT for the Government and PAYE for them, so why not let them do the same for tarfs and be their own custom offices The Government can audit them once every three months, then the problem is solved.APPARENTLY, dog-walking in Tehran has been outlawed by the Islamic government in a crackdown against pet ownership.Dog owners will even face penaltiesspotted carrying their pets in a car.Tehran’s chief of police, Brigadier-General Hossein Rahimi, said the ban had been introduced because dogs “create fear and anxiety” among members of the public.Ironically, my experience is that dogs create exactly the opposite reaction.But what do you expect from a country that doesn’t allow women to initiate orce, dance or report a rape .Our country might be crazy at the moment, but let’s all breathe a sigh of relief we live here, rather than there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg offers his view:THE EU has taken an almost religious approach to Britain’s latest move towards securing a Brexit deal.The compromise put forward by my fellow MP Kit Malthouse has been immediately dismissed and any prospect of further negotiation turned away. The mighty EU has spoken and will not be gainsaid.In negotiating the compromise, both Leavers and Remainers made concessions. This has led to criticism from their supporters, as I found in my weekly radio show on LBC.Callers felt that I had become a “snowflake” in my willingness to see £billion of taxpayers’ money spent without giving us any advantage in future negotiations.The legal basis for the EU demanding money is weak. A House of Lords report came to the conclusion that while there could be a moral obligation, under UK, EU and international law there was no valid or forceful claim.The only motive for paying is to secure a good future deal, rather than to pay a ransom for our freedom.Yet I have come to the conclusion that leaving on March  is at risk and exiting the EU is a prize worth paying for and on which thewill be great.Unfortunately, in spite of the Referendum result, the majority of MPs are reluctant to see the UK part from the EU and at the least want terms that mirror our membership.This may well not be the view of most voters, who seem to welcome the clean break and are not fearful of the scare stories.It is, therefore, crucial to ensure the fears of those who are far from enthusiastic Brexiteers are assuaged. This is where the Malthouse Compromise comes in.By offering money and making the prospect of a No Deal Brexit unlikely, possible moderate former Remainers are willing to avoid Parliamentary tactics that would frustrate our departure.They can accept the replacement of the backstop, which could keep us tied in to the EU’s rules and courts forever, with a routine trade agreement based on existing processes commonly used around the world.This would not hamper the development of a future relationship which would be discussed once we have left. Although in these discussions we would lose the leverage of cash, we would not be squeezed by the backstop.The second stage of the compromise is that the implementation period could be extended by one year. Currently the withdrawal agreement proposes a maximum of two years.In this time we would remain subject to EU laws and what follows, but it makes the prospect of not finalising a future relationship less likely, which gives comfort to those who are determined to avoid No Deal.In my view, an extra  months of vassalage after  years is an unwelcome but not unaffordable price to pay. Critics may ask why Brexiteers want to lessen the chance of a No Deal departure — and the reason is simple.Regardless of the folly of Project Fear, which becomes more preposterous by the day, the Parliamentary arithmetic means we must either lessen the prospect by compromise or it will be done by sharp practice in the House of Commons.This could lead to delay or even no Brexit at all. This would destroy any remaining trust of politicians in our constitutional settlement, it would show reckless contempt for voters, yet the Brexit-denying amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper last week was only defeated by  votes.As with all compromises, Malthouse is not perfect but is enough for each side of the argument in the UK to accept.The question remains, will the EU response be positive  So far, it has not.This has always been at the heart of the debate, and in a way a compelling reason for going. Is the EU a Mafia-style organisation that has to punish countries that do not subscribe to its religion Their response to the Malthouse Compromise and the PM’s request to re-open the text will answer this question. It must be clear to the EU that the current withdrawal agreement will not do.Defeated in the Commons by the largest margin ever achieved in the lower house on Government business, it is simply too one-sided and allows too great a triumph to the EU.If the EU were to insist on its inalterability requiring the punishment of a recalcitrant, freedom-loving nation then it will reveal its true and barbarous colours. It would be evident on its own that we are right to leave.How much better it would bethis were wrong and that in fact the EU is the civilised organisation it claims to be — respecting democracy, the nation state and constitutional procedures.

Her squabbling party has called a temporary truce. And nobody, including the EU, wants Jeremy Corbyn to take control.Even Labour MPs are rallying behind her — at a price. And working-class voters have given the Tories a healthy seven-point lead. They might even win a snap election.Played skilfully, this could win a deal that satisfies both Remainers and Leavers.Yet there are fears Mrs May will use it to revive her wretched Chequers plan, which sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis, or the botched deal thrown out last month by a -vote margin.She has made a worrying start by apparently binning the No Deal card — the only one that truly scares the EU. Mrs May has no intention of playing this ace — and never had.There are other worrying signs.This showdown with EU hardliners requires fresh thinking and shrewd advice from seasoned players. Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are also clear that those solutions can not include new border infrastructures.”THE French last night told Transport Secretary Chris Grayling he was not welcome at Calais after he announced plans to ert ferries from the port under a no deal Brexit.The head of the French port Jean-Marc Puissesseau said he was never welcome toto the port as he accused Mr Grayling of being “completely disrespectful” for failing to forewarn the French about his contingency plans.The Sun revealed in October that Mr Grayling had drawn up plans to lease space on ferries so the Government can redirect them to Rotterdam and Belgian ports in case of logjams at Calais.Mr Puissesseau said the Transport Secretary gave no warning about the proposals - despite attending a meeting with port officials who insisted they could cope with extra customs checks that would be neededBritain crashes out of the EU without a deal.The French port chief told the : “Mr Grayling came to us in November and asked uswe would be ready. We told him ‘yes’, though we did not know as much as we know today. He did not tell us that he wanted to reduce the activity [at Calais].“It is not fair at all, it is completely disrespectful. I don’t want to see him again.”Mr Puissesseau added that Calais had injected fresh cash for a new traffic light system that will help combat logjams under a no deal Brexit.Green will be for lorries that have the correct paperwork, amber for those who are not sure and red for vehicles with no paperwork.He joked that Mr Grayling was so unpopular that he would also have to pass throught the traffic light systemhe did attempt to visit Calais.Mr Puissesseau said: “I have heard he is ‘failing Grayling’...He will have to have a declarationhe comes to Calais. He will have to go through the orange lane.”The anti-Brexit Best for Britain group last night said the move effectively meant Mr Grayling was “banned” from Calais.One of its supporters and Labour MP Virendra Sharma said: “Surely this is peak Chris Grayling - only this time he’s gone international.“All he needs to do now is release a statement blaming everyone  and his predictable path of chaos will be complete.”A spokesman from the Department for Transport said: “While the Transport Secretary strongly supports work across Government with the EU to ensure a deal is reached, he will also continue to lead the DfT to ensure all contingencies are prepared for concerning Brexit.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: . All two-and-a-half yapping hours of it, on ITV, with a bad hangover, in the company of presenters Ben Fogle and Sara Cox.A test beyond personal endurance not because of the alcohol or dogs, who are a largely blameless lot, but the presence of their barmy owners, who attribute all sorts of superpowers to their dumb little mutts and blur the human animal relationship way beyond the point of reason and sometimes even good taste.Hits Radio DJ Gemma Atkinson, for instance, claimed: “I wouldn’t be where I am today without Norman”, her pet sproodle.Which is a hell of a guilt trip to pin on any dog.While Spandau Ballet’s Martin Kemp was seen, sitting alongside Popsie the poodle and his Wham! backing-singer we Shirlie, exclaiming: “I’ll say this for her,she does do a poo she goes into the spare bathroom.”The least you’d expect, frankly, after  years of marriage.The case study that really finished me off, though, was a dog dancing instructor called Joan Clark and her powder puff hounds, whose act, as described by Sara Cox, was: “All building up to the big finish. Can she pull it off  Joan points to the spot and it’s one, two, three pups between her legs.”CHANNEL ’s Pure is a comedy drama about a woman who suffers from the sixth sense of seeing naked people and is so tormented by her condition she screams: “F***ing stop.

And today the Daily Mail andreport ministers have been discussing a delay of eight weeks, moving the date of Brexit to May .   It comes as Theresa May spends a second day in Northern Ireland today to meet Tories, Sinn Fein and the DUP in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock. The Prime Minister wants to tweak the backstop in her -page Brexit deal, which could trap the UK under EU customs rules to keep the Irish border open. She will travel to Brussels tomorrow for showdown talks with EU chiefs Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Antonio Tajani and Guy Verhofstadt. Mrs May hopes they will agree a time limit, an exit clause or alternative arrangements to the backstop - letting MPs sign off her deal on February . But EU chiefs have repeatedly made clear they will not rewrite the backstop.   And Irish premier Leo Varadkar - who has led public opposition to backstop changes - is holding crunch talks with EU Council President Donald Tusk today. Mrs May is said to have slapped down ministers discussing the extra time plan at Cabinet yesterday, saying it is counter-productive to talk about it as talks with the EU stall just  days before Brexit. She is busy examining a plan dubbed the Malthouse compromise that would replace the backstop but drive a coach and horses through EU red lines. Meanwhile a high-tech solution for the Irish border is under consideration again by the government - despite breaching many of the red lines about Northern Irelands future. The Drive Through Border Concept by Japanese firm Fujitsu would use numberplate recognition cameras to track vehicles crossing into the Republic. But this would involve exactly the kind of infrastructure on the border that Theresa May has refused in the past, and warned could be vandalised.

MPs on the Public Accounts Committee spoke out just moments after the House of Commons approved town halls   budget in a huge row. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire boasted the package will give town halls a fairer future as core spending power will rise by pound.bn to pound.bn.But the actual revenue support grant from the government is being cut by pound.bn, Labour say - with officials having to make up the dference from council tax.Shadow Communities Secretary Andrew Gwynne last night accused ministers of dressing up a cut as a rise like Alice Through The Looking Glass. Now, with perfect timing, expert MPs on the PAC have accused ministers of being in denial over the perilous state of local government finances in England.  In a damning report the PAC warned councils were under enormous pressure just to main essential services such as adult and childrens social care. And it warned the governments response had been short-term fixes to keep councils going, but with a disturbing lack of a clear plan for the future. Over the past eight years, central government funding to English local authorities has been cut by almost half, the PAC said. Meanwhile demand for services has risen, with the rate of looked-after children at  year high following a number of social care scandals. Between - and -, council spending on services fell by .% in real terms. And the Local Government Association estimates authorities face a pound. billion shortfall by -.  The Government responded by announcing a pound. billion cash injection in the Budget in October. But with half the money due to be spent before the end of the current financial year, the PAC said the government had been unable provide assurances it would be used effectively. And it warned outlets like libraries and youth services are being sidelined to prioritise the basic services councils have to provide by law. Some councils are now in an extremely worrying position, PAC warned. Overspending their budgets for social care, reducing key services, falling back on financial reserves and increasingly relying on generating other sources of income, which comes with greater risks. The committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: The Government is in denial about the perilous state of local finances.  It insists the sector is sustainable yet is unwilling or unable to back up this claim. Flimsy assertions have no place in financial planning. Government needs to get real, listen fully to the concerns of local government and take a hard look at the real impact funding reductions have on local services. And then it needs to plan properly for the long-term. Richard Watts, Chair of the Local Government Association’s Resources Board, said: Funding cuts and demand pressures are pushing local services to the brink. “The Spending Review will therefore be make or break for vital local services and securing the financial sustainability of councils must be the top priority. If we truly value our local services then we have to be prepared to pay for them. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said the current settlement would pave the way for a fairer, more self-sufficient and resilient future for local government. That is why local authorities will have more control over the money they raise and a real terms increase in their core spending power, he said. The settlement also recognises the pressures councils face in meeting growing demand for services and rewards their impressive efforts to drive efficiencies and rebuild our economy.

Jenefer Gillam, , saw her weight creep up after gorging on huge portions of quick-fix caloric food. The NHS worker, from East Preston, West Sussex began experiencing breathlessness, aching joints and indigestion - and decided to overhaul her whole lestyle in  after catching a glimpse of herself in a lt at work. Jenefer said: I just thought – ‘Jenefer, you’re enormous. Determined to change, Jenefer, whose partner Glenn, , is a technology sales consultant, joined WW, formerly known as Weight Watchers, in early  and has since completely changed her diet - slimming down to a size  after an eight stone weight loss. Jenefer, mum to Ethan, , and Eva, seven, revealed: “Since losing the weight, I’ve bumped into colleagues from dferent offices, or friends that I don’t see regularly, and they haven’t even recognised me. I’ll get a blank look when I say hello, before they realise who I am.”   Struggling with her weight for much of her le, the super-slimmer admitted to embarking on ious dferent diets over the years, without much success. Her problem escalated after having children and when, in , she started studying for a Masters degree, juggling lectures with work and being a mum meant any notion of healthy eating and exercise took a back seat. She explained: “The weight crept on as I’d be sitting there in the evenings studying and grabbing quick fixes. “I did also eat fruit and vegetables and wasn’t one for takeaways or anything like that, but it was more the portion sizes that were the problem. My portions would be huge.” Most mornings, Jenefer would start with peanut butter on toast, before grabbing a coffee and a cake or bacon butty once she got to college. Then lunch would be a cheese-laden panini followed by comfort food for dinner, like a jacket potato piled high with toppings, or a pie. “I had a terrible crisp habit, too,” she said. “I could easily get through a family bag, then fib about it, saying the kids had eaten it.” Eventually, Jenefer reached her heaviest weight of st lb – although she said she still felt relatively confident.   But, in late , everything changed during a seemingly routine morning at her work in clinical services for the NHS. After taking the lt to avoid the stairs, she saw herself in the mirror and felt asshe was seeing the change in her body for the first time. “I thought to myself, ‘You’re fat, you’re getting out of breath easily – you have to do something.’ I’d been getting all sorts of health problems like aching knees and ankles, terrible indigestion and high cholesterol,” she said. “I knew I had to change for the sake of my kids. It was never about confidence. Even at my biggest, I always tried to make the best of myself with makeup and having my hair done – but I didn’t want anything to happen to me. I had to think of Ethan and Eva.” But, since joining WW, she has now lost eight stone and, at the end of , also started regularly working out at a local gym. “It does take courage to walk in there when you aren’t a skinny Minnie, as you worry what people will say,” she said. “I started out with quite gentle exercise, but now I go five times a week and do more high intensity classes like spinning. “I never thought I’d be able to do that.” Her body overhaul has also meant Jenefer has more fun with her children.   “The best thing about it is being able to keep up with the kids more. I can go swimming with them, or bike rides at the weekend, she said. “We can even go to theme parks now, when, on two occasions in the past, I was too heavy for the rides and had to get off. It was the most mortying thing – one of those moments where everybody is staring, and you just want the ground to swallow you up. “Now, I don’t even have to think about it.” With the help of the WW app, Jenefer has transformed her eating habits too, downloading healthy recipes and ensuring she eats a balanced diet, aided by their Smartpoints system. The apps built-in barcode scanner also means Jenefer is able to check food whilst in the supermarket to see how many points it would be worth - and can even win prizes for sticking to her plan through WWs new WellnessWins reward programme.   Now, breakfast will be nutrient-packed overnight oats - a favourite with fitness bloggers - followed by fresh home-cooked meals, such as butternut squash shepherds pie or garlicky chicken with vegetables. “I have a busy le, but this regime is manageable for me. I can find recipes I like and make them quickly and easily,” she said. “Now, when I look back, I can’t quite believe it’s me in old photos. I walk much taller these days and feel very proud. “For my th birthday just gone, I even wore a black sleeveless jumpsuit. It’s something I never dreamed I’d see myself in, but I felt fantastic.”For information, visit www.weightwatchers uk"},{"url":null,"title":"pub owners brutal takedown customers","story":"NewsPub owners brutal takedown of customers one-star TripAdvisor reviewThe owner of the Hobgoblin in Bishopston, Bristol, delivered a scathing response to a review of the pubShareCommentsByTristan Cork:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThe Hobgoblin pub in Bishopston, Bristol\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA customer who left a one-star TripAdvisor review of a pub was given short shrt by the landlord in a blistering response. The customer had allegedly claimed she was a police officer and that her human rights were violated when staff refused to give her a free round of drinks when she dropped the previous round on the floor. She later took to TripAdvisor to claim that the pubs staff had taken a disliking to her group and had an issue with happy people, Bristol Live reports.In his scathing riposte, landlord James Aylfe asked the woman, Hows the head this morning , and claimed she had been kicked out of the Hobgoblin pub in Bristol. His reply is serving as another example of bar and restaurant owners hitting back at bad reviews.   The woman, registered on TripAdvisor as ‘Chloe A’ posted on the public review website on Saturday night after allegedly being kicked out of the venue.Her review was headed ‘unreasonable’, and complained the bar staff took her for being drunk, even though she said she wasn’t. She explained how she and four friends had entered the pub but her stay did not last long. “The staff took a disliking to us the second we walked in,” she wrote. “We are a group of five who haven’t seen each other since uni. “They told us we were too drunk despite not having any alcohol before entering the establishment. This pub clearly has an issue with happy people,” she added. At least that is the best interpretation of what Chloe A wrote on TripAdvisor, Bristol Live reported.She actually tapped in: “The staff good a disliking to use the second we walked in. We are a group of  who haven’t seen us since uni. They told us we were too drunk despite not having any alcohol before entering the establishmst. This pub clearly has an issue with happy people.” Hobgoblin owner James saw the review the next day, and claims he immediately recognised who Chloe A was from the night before. He decided to respond to set the record straight, and also back up his staff, who were allegedly left upset by the experience of dealing with Chloe.   James response on TripAdvisor began inquiring after her health, before saying she might not be able to remember exactly what happened. He explained things began well - she was served a round of drinks with no problem. But then Chloe A’s time in the Hobgoblin took something of a downward turn almost immediately, because as she carried them back to the table, she spilt all the drinks after ‘stumbling away from the bar, barging into another customer’ And it was at this point, according to James, it started getting a little weird, and rather unpleasant for the staff behind the bar. She ed to the bar and ‘aggressively demanded’ replacement drinks for free, James wrote. “At this point you began threatening a member of bar staff,” he wrote, followed up by a scathing remark. “You claimed to be a police officer and that you could arrest the member of staff . “You threatened tothe following day with senior officers to pursue this further and suggested that we were infringing on your human rights,” he added. But James went on to explain the effect this behaviour had on staff and other customers. One member of staff was reduced to tears, other customers complained about her behaviour, he said. And when the assistant manager asked Chloe A to leave, she was not going to go quietly. According to James, she ‘continued to remonstrate aggressively with my assistant manager threatening all manner of consequences, demanding he hand over the full names of the staff who had refused to serve you so you could sue them for breaching your human rights’. “So the thing is Chloe,what you say is true and you really werent drunk when you arrived, then what you are asking us to accept is that these are the actions of you as a sober person,” he added, before ending by stating he was ‘completely comfortable’ with how she was treated by his staff, and suggesting that she should perhaps come to the bar with an apology. Since he posted the response on the pubs Facebook page, it has gone viral. Bristol Live has messaged Chloe A, but is yet to receive a response. James said he took the decision to share his response as a show of support for the staff involved. We dont get many one-star reviews, in fact I think hers was the just the third, so mercully we havent particularly suffered from reviews like this, he told Bristol Live . I didnt want to make a big deal about it, but I didnt feel I could just leave it unanswered. What has been really nice is that the response from customers has been almost universally positive - its been really nice to see, and nice for the staff, becauseyou get a slightly unpleasant experience it can knock your confidence in dealing with people. What was also good was that a number of people commented that they were there and that the staff did really well and acted properly, he added. James Aylfes response in full Hi Chloe, Hows the head this morning  Id be surprisedyou can actually remember your behaviour last night so, just in case its a little foggy, lets have a recap, shall we  Although you were initially served a round of drinks, after you stumbled away from the bar and barged into another customer, dropping your drinks on the floor, we began to realise that you werent *entirely* sober. This assessment was further strengthened when you ed to the bar, aggressively demanding that your spilt drinks be replaced for free. You were refused. At this point you began threatening a member of bar staff. You claimed to be a police officer and that you could arrest the member of staff . You threatened tothe following day with senior officers to pursue this further and suggested that we were infringing on your human rights. In the cold light of this morning these were rather obviously the angry ravings of someone well in their cups but as funny as it sounds now, you were extremely aggressive and intimidating at the time. A number of other customers commented that your behaviour was inappropriate, and you reduced the member of bar staff to tears. Once we had discussed what had happened, we decided that frankly it would be bestyou all moved on and we informed you that we wouldnt be serving you any further. Instead of leaving quietly with your friends you continued to remonstrate aggressively with my assistant manager threatening all manner of consequences, demanding he hand over the full names of the staff who had refused to serve you so you could sue them for breaching your human rights. So the thing is Chloe,what you say is true and you really werent drunk when you arrived, then what you are asking us to accept is that these are the actions of you as a sober person. Im really not sure that paints you in a particularly flattering light either way and I am completely comfortable with how you were dealt with last night. As for where we go from here, Ill leave that up to you. Id suggest contrition and heartfelt apology as a bare minimum requirement to you being served here againbut you are, of course, free to seek to enforce your *ahem* human rights in the courtsyou are so determined.

Her beloved father, King George VI passed away in his sleep and she became the Queen. When the news was broken to Princess Elizabeth she was enjoying a holiday in Kenya with her husband, Prince Philip. The evening before, she had been taking pictures of the incredible wildle from their tree top hideaway, including baboons, elephants and even a warthog. The princess had even asked to eat her evening meal outside in the Treetops hotel so she could continue to take photographs into the night.   And she had even woke early the next day to capture two rhinos fighting at a watering hole nearby. The couple got ready to depart for the next stage of their tour, which should have also taken them to New Zealand and Australia. But first they were travelling to a fishing lodge called Sangana some  miles away. Back in England, at Sandringham, the Kings staff were preparing to wake him for the day. Despite his recent bout of ill health, he had been happy the previous day and had even been on a shoot with a friend.   His final acts were to play with his two grandchildren, Charles and Anne, and have dinner with his youngest daughter, Princess Margaret. James McDonald, the Kings valet, realised something was seriously wrong with the monarch when he ran him a bath and he didnt wake as he usually did. A doctor was called to the palace who confirmed the sad news that King George had passed away in his sleep. But the couples secluded and isolated location meant it was almost impossible to break the terrible news to the princess that her father was dead. Journalist Granville Roberts, who was covering the royal tour, was the first person to receive the news in Kenya.  After it had been announced the country, Roberts spotted a breaking news memo from Reuters confirming that the king was dead. He immediately told Prince Philips private secretary, Commander Michael Parker, who tuned into the BBC to confirm the news. The Duke of Edinburgh had been taking an afternoon nap and was stunned when he was woken told the sad news. And Prince Philip now had to work out how he would tell his we the tragic news that the father she adored had died and she was now Queen. Rather than tell his we in a formal setting, surrounded by their staff, Philip took her for a walk in the grounds of the lodge they were staying in.  It was a private moment for the couple while Elizabeth could be alone with her husband during her moment of grief. She was just -years-old. Ever aware of her public duty, Elizabeth immediately discussed the practicalities of herto England. But she also asked for an hour alone in her room. The Queenswas delayed for several hours due to a storm. Her staff also realised her mourning outfit had already been sent on by plane to the next stop on her royal tour.  When the royal plane touched down in London, a black dress was brought on board for her to change into before she emerged to the full glare of the press and public. Prime Minsiter Winston Churchill was in the welcome party to greet Britains new queen home. Her coronation took place the following year and the first ever to be televised. Queen Elizabeth II is now the longest-reigning monarch and became the first British monarch to celebrate her Sapphire Jubilee -  years on the throne - last year.

The -year-old died suddenly on Sunday - but her death is not being treated as suspicious. Following her passing, one of Allis closest friends Siobhan OConnor spoke glowingly about the model. Writing in the Irish Mirror , Siobhan said: My lasting memory of Alli is as one of my true confidantes. Two weeks ago, I phoned her to tell her I admired the bones of her.   I phoned Alli to congratulate her on single-handedly rearing four beautul children and to ask her about her own coping skills. I could barely handle a few days going solo [with my children] and she told me I was enough, I was doing the best I could. In her usual, gregarious, witty way she laughed her head off at me as she whipped up a fry for her large family and told me: Welcome to the club, it’s tough but so worth it, it’s feeding time at the zoo here.  I have to get up at am every day and keep going until I collapse into bed by pm, just to keep theshow on the road. Siobhan said her friend appeared to have it all under control. And at parties she was always the one to serve up gourmet feasts with the motto to give without ever expecting to receive. Siobhan said: At a recent gathering several weeks ago, I caught Alli changing our two-year-old daughters nappy.   I cajoled her for taking on another task and she brushed it off, saying: I change a dirty nappy every half an hour, sure I used to work in a creche. Alli was one of the most selfless down-to-earth girls I’ve ever met, when times got tough she just kept going. The Andrea Roche model gave tirelessly, working with Autism Ireland and helped to raise awareness and garner resources for the charity. Her little boy Harry, nine, and her two-year-old daughter Siena were both diagnosed with the condition. So with first-hand experience, she knew how important such services are. Sleeping beauty Alli will never wake up again and her tragic death does not make any sense to any of her friends who mourned her on Monday at an intimate evening wake at John and Marlon’s, said Siobhan.   She had her whole le in front of her. We can’t fathom that she is gone, we are inconsolable. Some weeks previous she told of her excitement that two new TV shows were on the horizon and the prospect of getting stuck in. Alli was on course to front a TV sketch show and she was in talks to spearhead an investigative documentary on autism. Siobhan said: Every time I think of her four beautul children who are left behind, my stomach aches. Their mum will never get to see them get married and she will never get to collect her precious daughter Siena from the school gates. We are praying for them eternally. RIP our wonderful, beautul friend, you are gone and it hurts like hell, but you are never ever forgotten. It yesterday emerged police want to speak to anyone who was in contact with a tragic model in the hours before her death. Shortly before she passed away, she left her followers a cryptic Facebook post which read: Why is it ok for a man to call z girl a fat ugly C***        Seriously new level of pushing someone to the edge. Now it has emerged police will be taking statements from anyone who was in contact with her before her death - through social media or other means. But a Garda source told Irish Mirror they are not treating the mum-of-fours death as suspicious.

And the truth is lots of us have been guilty of judging other parents for having noisy little ones too - when we all know it can be dficult to keep them under control. One mum says a man was huffing and puffing about her and her toddler as they sat behind him on a flight. She said it was the first time her child went on a plane - and understandably found it to be challenging. Stephanie Hollield, a parenting blogger, wrote an open letter published on Momstrosity to the annoyed man - and every parent will be able to relate.   She wrote: To the Gentleman on Flight , I first noticed you when you sighed loudly as you laid eyes on me and my toddler boarding the plane. In a momentary lapse of judgement, we sat behind you. It was the nearest set of seats, and I couldnt wait to put my child and our heavy bags down. From the over-dramatic huffs and puffs you let out as we buckled in, it was clear that you were annoyed by our very presence. At this point, my little girl was laughing and playing, obviously too loud for your liking. I wonderedyou had a bad day, orthis grouchy temperament was your normal behavior. She continued to say that it the first time that I had ever flown with a child, and I was making half of the trip without my husband after spending weeks researching tips to keep her daughter calm. I did everything in my power to keep her calm and quiet. I shushed her, and made sure her little feet didnt kick your seat. As we took off, her tears started. The kicking and the screaming tantrums came on fast. She was exhausted and fussy. You did not let up with your mutters of annoyance and looks over your shoulder. I apologized to everyone around me. I almost started crying myself.   I was feeling shame and guilt for not being able to control my own child. The mum added that she felt at her wits end when a flight attendant came over and gave her baby a straw and cup to play with - and she was suddenly content. The kind attendant told us, Its ok! Flying is tough on everyone, and you are both doing great! Somehow, her kindness calmed the baby and made the mum feel better. She added that kids are the future, and while they might be inconvenient now - theyll be the people doing amazing things when were all grey and old. Its an important reminder not to judge mums and dads who are clearly doing their best when their kids wont be quiet in a public place. Anyone who has cared for little ones will know how tough it can be - and it doesnt take much to smile and be kind instead of rolling your eyes to make parents feel bad.

She added that her mother-in-law went rogue after she and her husband-to-be had tried to plan her outfit with her to fit their colour scheme.   We gave her around five colours to pick from in our theme and tried to make it fun for her because she’s been so unexcited about the whole wedding. Even though they went out for a day of shopping, the bride explained how she later received a text from her future mum-in-law telling her she’d bought a dress on her own - but she refused to show the design. After her partners little sister sneaked a snap of herself in the dress, the bride-to-be was furious. The dress is white with a floral design and even has a train. The mother-in-law explained when confronted about the dress: I dont want to be the same colour as the bridesmaids and any light pink, blush, peach colours like that wash me out.   Im sorry that yall don’t think I can pick out a presentable dress for your wedding. I feel like Im an embarrassment to everyone and have to have my dress picked out like Im a child. It hurts. She continued to say thatshe felt like she was going to shame or embarrass the couple with her outfit then shell just sit in the back. People on social media quickly agreed with the bride-to-be, and many called out the mother-in-laws behaviour.   One wrote: No one wears white to a wedding … Its disrespectful. Its their day don’t ruin it by wearing something with a train or white. Another agreed: The audacity of some people... Several called out her behaviour, saying she was being manipulative. One wrote: The whole emotionally manipulative thing of ‘Oh I’ll just sit in the back and leave right after’ sob story makes me sooooo mad.

Raphael Samuel, from Mumbai, India, is reportedly part of a so-called child-free advocate group that believes children should not be made to suffer le. He has been described as an anti-natalist who thinks parents do not have the right to give birtha child has not agreed to being born. Now his mother, Kavita, has spoken out saying she admires her sons temerity. She went on to say her son has caused an upheaval in her le and listed the reasons why. Kavita added: I must admire my sons temerity to want to take his parents to court knowing both of us are lawyers.   If Raphael could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault. The media has focused on a sliver of what Raphael believes in. His belief in anti-natalism, his concern for the burden on Earths resources due to needless le, his sensitivity toward the pain experienced unwittingly by children while growing up and so much more has been ruefully forgotten. Im very happy that my son has grown up into a fearless, independent thinking young man. He is sure to find his path to happiness. Kavita Karnad Samuel. After revealing his plans to take legal action against his own parents, Raphael claims he has a great relationship with the pair. I want to tell all Indian kids that they don’t owe their parents anything, he told The Print.   I love my parents, and we have a great relationship, but they had me for their joy and their pleasure. My le has been amazing, but I don’t see why I should put another le through the rigamarole of school and finding a career, especially when they didn’t ask to exist. Raphael said that people must know it is an option to not have children and to ask your parents for an explanation as to why they have birth to you. In a video posted on YouTube, he talks about a myth of respecting elders in India, but says what we should be respecting is peoples actions. He asks: Has that person treated you well  Is that person giving you freedom  Is that person encouraging your growth    Your parents are two people at the age of - who just wanted a good night together and then they had you, he adds. He thinks parents owe children for bringing them joy, rather than the other way round. You must love themyou feel like loving them, he says.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off. The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday. If all the lads put in % like that I don’t see why we can’t get the three points.”Despite coming in from mid-table League One side Scunthorpe to join Dundee’s push to avoid relegation from the Premiership, Dales says he’s up for the challenge.“Some people prefer to go into a promotion-chasing team but, for me, there’s nothing wrong with being in a relegation battle.“I’m up for that and I think every single player in the changing-room is definitely up for it.“With the quality we have and,we can keep showing that for most of the game, there’s no reason why we can’t get to where we should be.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5435fee7f0d9.26716581.jpg ","title":"dundee united loan signing charlie seaman wants to return to bournemouth with medal","story":"Dundee United loan signing Charlie Seaman has come to Dundee United to develop as a player and get first-team experience.And he also aims to be heading back to parent club Bournemouth this summer with a Scottish Championship medal in his pocket.In capturing the -year-old full-back from one of the surprise success stories of the English Premier League over the past few seasons, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson stressed the deal was exactly what it said on the tin – a loan.The end of the season will see Seaman head back to the south coast and be expected to challenge for a top-team place with the Cherries.However, while his time in Scotland will be a learning experience, the former West Ham youth wants success as well.“Hopefully, coming here and learning dferent things will help me for when I go back for next season,” he said.“I can learn dferent styles here so I am really happy to be in Scotland with United.“The boys here love to play football and that’s good because it’s that way down at Bournemouth.“Every side of the game, though, on the ball, off the ball I am trying to learn, it’s what I’m here for. Defensively I am trying to be better and I want to be better offensively as well.“I came here to get experience of first-team football. I was waiting for my chance at Bournemouth but I felt I could get it here sooner, get some games for the rest of the season. Hopefully I will be more readyI get the opportunity when I go back, or wherever it may be.“There is a job to do for the team as well and our goal at Dundee United is to win this league. Yes, it would be nice to be finishing the season with a medal for that.”Seaman’s time north of the border hardly got off to the perfect start and, within hours of his arrival, he was tasting defeat as United went down to Ayr.His temporary manager was disappointed with the team performance at Somerset Park but did make a point of saying the new arrival had put in some good work.The young full-back took encouragement from that but has admitted he did not necessarily agree with Robbie’s assessment.“I was happy to make my debut last week, obviously disappointed with the loss, but it was good to get out there and experience something dferent,” he added.“I didn’t think I started the game too well but I thought I grew into it. Still, personally, I don’t think it was one of my better games by any stretch.“It was my first game at the club, my first playing a dferent style of football and my first playing in dferent weather conditions and stuff like that.“It was all a learning curve, something to take from that game into future games.“I came up Thursday night, so I only had a day here before the game but I have high expectations and I like to set high standards.“When I don’t reach them, I’m disappointed.”The aim now is to show up well as he makes his home debut as Morton visit Tannadice and United try to get back to winning ways to keep in touch with leaders Ross County.And Seaman does admit this week has given him more time to do his homework on the opposition, saying: “Before Ayr the gaffer gave me a lot of clips of Ayr to watch so I had a fair idea of what they were going to do.“I was relatively ready for the game in a tactical aspect but I did only come up on Thursday night.“For this game against Morton we have been getting information throughout the week.

I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here. My mum and dad talked about it a lot, how everyone is immersed in the sport.“I get in taxis here and they are talking about it and all the people are. I love that.”For Ian, though, just being able to experience le in a football-mad country is not going to be enough.He’s come to United to progress his career and that means helping get them back to the Premiership and making a name for himself at that level.With the squad Robbie Neilson has put together, that’s a goal he’s convinced he will achieve.“There’s a lot of new guys in the squad and I thought you saw us start off well against Morton,” he added.“You also saw glimpses in the second half where we had to finish off the game and get that third goal and we didn’t.“However, I think in the first half the guys were moving the ball around well and getting into good positions.“Pete Pawlett was coming inside for us and Pav Safranko was stretching them. That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united sign former st johnstone defender mark connolly","story":"Dundee United have signed defender Mark Connolly from Crawley Town for an undisclosed fee.Irish-born Connolly joins United on a contract until the end of season .As a youngster, he spent a season at St Johnstone and two seasons at Kilmarnock where he became club captain between two separate periods at Crawley Town.He has represented Ireland at Under , Under  and  level.The -year-old becomes Robbie Neilson#s ninth signing of the January window and third of a busy final day.

We had to go for IVF which was successful and we found out I was pregnant after  days.“We went to the -week scan so happy because we had made the decision that we wanted to know the gender. That’s when the nurse told us we were having a wee girl then she continued with her examination. She stopped and paused and said she needed to check something. And that’s when she said there was an anomaly on Jessica’s back and we had to see a specialist doctor.”Kat continued: “We asked her what it was and she said she couldn’t say for sure but that it looked like a form of Spina Bida.

win at Easter Road at the weekend, when the Dons battled back from a goal behind despite losing leading scorer Sam Cosgrove and keeper Joe Lewis to injury in an eventful first half.For Considine it is quality, not quantity, that counts at Pittodrie.He said: “I know there was a lot of grumbling about us not bringing in too many players.“However, we have such a strong squad here.“I know to some it looks thin but the quality we have is the strongest in a very long time.“We showed that at Easter Road as the boys were outstanding from start to finish.“We lost two big players with Sam and then Joe’s head knock against the post.“Those were two blows but Tomasdid well and Jamescould have had two or three goals, he was outstanding.“We also have a couple of boys out injured who are set to come back. It is hopefully going to be an exciting run-in to the end of the season.”Aberdeen will tonight bid to extend their dominance over Rangers since Steven Gerrard was named manager last summer.The Reds have won the last two clashes in Glasgow and were held - at Pittodrie in August.After that draw, the opening Premiership fixture of the season, Gerrard insisted Rangers “are a class above” Aberdeen.Head-to-heads and the tightness of the league campaign make a mockery of that claim.Considine insists those comments are forgotten and have no bearing on the build-up for tonight.Besides, no added motivation is needed when facing Gers in a game that always delivers that “extra edge”.He said: “Whatever has been said by whoever, that doesn’t matter.“Just playing Rangers fires you up. Playing any of the Old Firm fires you up.“Football nowadays, though, you have to be fired up for every game, regardless.“Games against Rangers, there is always that little edge.“Everyone will be up for it and it should be a full house.“It is a great chance to go second but it is so tight.“We will go in with confidence and Rangers will go in with confidence so it should be a cracker.”Following the appointment of Liverpool and England legend Gerrard as manager last summer, Rangers were installed by bookmakers and many pundits as favourites to challenge Celtic.That was despite the Dons finishing Premiership runners-up for the last four seasons.Gerrard and the Ibrox board have splashed well in excess of £ million to sht the balance in Scottish football yet have failed to beat Aberdeen this season and are only two points ahead.Considine reckons the Reds are underestimated every year in favour of the Glasgow two. It is a situation Aberdeen are comfortable with and an assumption they have consistently proved wrong. They intend to do the same this season.When asked about the focus being on Celtic and Rangers, he said: “Every year it seems to be the same as we get pushed aside.“However, the manager has always said we take it game by game and that is one thing we do very well at this club. We don’t get ahead of ourselves and our football talks for itself.“With what has happened over the last five, six years, since the manager has come in, the results have shown that.”Throughout an ongoing centre-back injury crisis, Considine, , has underlined his versatility by operating at both left and right-sided centre-back.Prior to that he had featured at left-back for the Reds.One of Aberdeen’s longest serving players with  appearances, Considine’s contract expires at the end of the season.He has had preliminary talks with boss Derek McInnes and hopes to step that up soon.On his Dons’ future, he said: “There is not much happening at the minute.“I had a conversation with the manager towards the end of last year but hopefully in the next couple of weeks we will sit down again and have a chat.“This is my th year here and I am well settled. It is a fantastic club that has been very good to me but once we have a conversation with the manager we will take it from there.”Aberdeen set up the chance to jump to second above Rangers with victory at Easter Road to extend an unbeaten run to six games. That was despite falling behind to an Oli Shaw goal after just nine minutes.Considine, who netted the equaliser, said: “It was up to probably Tommieor myself to close the space down for the shot and he has let rip from  yards and it went in the bottom corner.“It was a great strike but we had a quick response, which was great.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/11/5a0015025ac02-e1509973536904-649x564.jpg ","title":"call to register interest in child adoption in north east","story":"A leading north-east councillor has urged people who are considering adopting a child to register their interest.Aberdeenshire Council’s adoption team is offering assistance and support to families who are interested in joining the programme.The local authority offers a full in-house permanence planning service for children to allow them to move in with families who have worked with adoption services and have been properly prepared for the process.Bosses at the service say this allows them to tailor support accordingly for both the families and the children in their care.Concurrency planning is offered where the children are under two years old, along with post-adoption care.In its most recent Care Inspectorate report, the service received the top rating for its staffing and quality of care and support.Councillor Gillian Owen, chairwoman of the council’s education and children’s services committee, said: “There are children in Aberdeenshire who desperately need families, soyou are considering adoption, I would encourage you to register for the preparation to adopt course to seeit is for you.”“The team are friendly, supportive and have a wealth of knowledge about the process of adoption.“They take great care in matching children with families as well as using techniques and strategies to help children and their new family bond together in a loving and caring environment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chance to have your say on extended hours for aberdeen bars and clubs","story":"Aberdeen residents have been urged to have their say on which dates bars and clubs should have extended hours.Aberdeen City Council is looking for opinions from members of the public on which national and local holidays should see an additional hour granted for sales.A spokeswoman for the local authority said: “The licensing board is seeking to gauge opinion on dates in  that may be suitable for the grant of a general extension for events of a local or national signicance.“This would include potential dates in the festive period as well as other signicant dates throughout the year.“Traditionally the extension has been one additional hour to all on-sales premises whose standard hours conform to the board’s maximum daily trading period.”Members of the public have been urged to have their say by e-mailing licensing@aberdeencity.gov.uk by Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"exercise tutors wanted for aberdeen sheltered housing complexes","story":"Volunteers are wanted to help with a new weekly programme across sheltered housing complexes in Aberdeen.The project by Sport Aberdeen takes around  minutes and involves showing residents seated exercises to help older adults be more active.The charitable organisation is looking for people who can give up their time for a couple of hours a week.Sessions are due to be delivered during the day, with full training given to those interested.A meeting will be held on Wednesday to provide people with information.

My house is one of the worst affected, the ceilings don’t even touch the walls anymore.“My husband and children have had to move in with family because of health issues so I’m living here alone.” vw, px\"  Subsidence occurs when the ground under a property collapses, or sinks lower, taking some of the building’s foundations with it.This puts strain on the home’s structure as one side sinks, causing cracks to appear. Many of the residents have also reported damp problems and cold flats.It is understood the four options on the table are for external repairs, micropiling and ground beams, mass concrete underpinning and demolishing the buildings then rehoming the residents. All options other than external repairs would result in residents being rehomed, with the building work displacing people in the area for up to five years.Micropiling and ground beams – where strengthening rods are drilled into the ground – would take five years to complete, mass concrete underpinning four years, and external works six to eight weeks. vw, px\"  It would take around  weeks to totally demolish the buildings.John and Marilyn Davidson have lived on Errol Place for  years and believe demolition is the only option.John said: “We have had damp in the bedrooms. The conditions of the houses are awful.“They should demolish them – they’re that bad.”The couple said they have been plagued with issues like windows and doors “twisting”.Even when their front door was closed they could see outside through a crack next to the hinge.John added: “They aren’t worth anything. We’ve been here  years and the only work that’s been done is external painting.“The stairwells were meant to be redone but they never have been. The doorway is twisted and so are the window frames. There are times we can hardly lock them.“They’re not worthwhile living in.”Marilyn added: “I wish they would make up their minds about what they are doing.”Another resident, James Gray, , who lives on Errol Street, said he was one of the lucky ones, having avoided issues like damp in his home. He too, however, would like to see the buildings demolished. vw, px\"  He said: “They said it will take four or five years to do all the underpinning, and they can rehome everyone. I must be one of the lucky ones. It’s a cold flat, there’s a draught from the windows, but I haven’t had any damp.“There’s nothing concrete been decided. There’s seven houses empty, the one next door has been empty for two years. It’s a shame when there’s people homeless.“I’ve lost my family over the past couple of years so I want to move. I was going to go away for a month in January with my daughter and son-in-law but then all of this happened and I couldn’t.“They’ve said they would move us into a like-for-like house.”Agnes Brands, , who lives in Errol Place, said she would like to stay in her flat.

In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights. It’s a dficult one to take to get beat.They’re a big strong team and at times we didn’t cope with that.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsAyr United FC"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields national trust who","story":"NewsBob Shields: National Trust owe an apology over asking people for donations to restore Burns CottageShareByGary Fanning:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsBurns Cottage needs restoration\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailI’m trying to imagine the back-slapping and glad-handing at the National Trust For Scotland’s Hermiston Quay headquarters when someone came up with a spfing ‘Save Burns Cottage’ wheeze. “Let’s send out a begging letter to all those with Burns Cottage closest to their hearts – the people of Ayr . . .” “Wonderful idea!” “We could arrange for it to land on their doorsteps on Burns birthday – January  . . .” “That’s genius!” “Throw in some pictures of cracked walls and the dodgy thatched roof . . . “ “Fantastic!” “Use phrases like “before it’s too late” – or “damaged beyond repair” . . . “It’s heartbreaking!” “That’s Burns Cottage sorted then! Gin and tonic anyone ” “Large ones all round!” To be serious though – I still can’t decide what made me angrier. The crass begging bowl letter – hoping to cash in on the biggest Burns day of the year  Or the fact that Burns Cottage has been allowed to fall into such a state that phrases like “damaged beyond repair” are even necessary  If we’re talking man’s insensitivity to man here – then last Friday’s NTS letter takes the bannock! Its contents have upset dozens of people I know – and judging by the reaction on social media, hundreds more that I don’t know. Nicky Cotter wrote: “NTS . . . put your hands in your pockets and get it fixed. If you can spend pound, on a wooden tree house at Culzean Castle – you can stump up pound, to fix one of the most historically and culturally signicant buildings in Scotland”. Spot on, sir. The NTS letter tells us that “time and Scotland’s wet winters have taken their toll”. Yes – that’ll be the  winters since Burns father William Burness built the cottage on . And during that period, it’s been thatched more times than Wayne Rooney’s balding napper. If the current thatch “has signicant tears and has worn away”, you have to askthe last thatching work was in some way inferior - orthe cottage needed re-thatched several years ago and the work was never undertaken  You then start wondering how the auld clay biggin’ managed to survive the  wet Scottish winters between the cottage being built and the National Trust for Scotland’s formation back in   The answer is fairly obvious. Back then – people looked after it! And you only have to look at the recent row over the deteriorating Burns Monument to start wonderingthe NTS is the right custodian of our Burns heritage  Burns Cottage is everything Mr Cotter said earlier . .. and more. It’s the most important building in Ayrshire – by a lang Scots mile. Every nook, cranny - and twig of its roof - should be the subject of a fingertip, annual inspection. And whatever work is required – at whatever cost – should be sanctioned immediately. In fact, I imagine that’s what ‘most people’ thought was already happening. But then we had last Friday’s mail . . . when ‘most people’ discovered to their horror that the north-west gable is starting to pull away from the rest of the cottage! If admission fees don’t cover the cost of Burns Cottage – then put them up! The last figures I have show , visitors in . Charging them an extra p would have reached the pound, required – with enough left over to putty the windows as well. So, I’m sorry, NTS. But this was the wrong letter . . . to the wrong people . . . on the wrong day.

Buzzworks, who have operated Elliots as their flagship in the town, say the rebrand will be split into two halves.

The bar will be called Vic’s and will be a “modern take on a traditional bar”, featuring sport and entertainment. Weekend opening hours will remain at .am.  Designer Jim Hamilton is leading the project, which will include a new glass roof in part of the bar. A new kitchen boasting a churrasco BBQ pit is also planned.

Builders Dawn Developments wanted to build a new block in its place to home a gym and shops. But the plan was cut short as council planners want the hotel preserved or refurbished instead. And the sale happened after concerns about the safety of the former hotel were discussed at this month’s Fort, Seafield, and Wallacetown Community Council held at Ayr Town Hall. One community councillor said: “It is the most dangerous building in Ayr. ” It wasn’t the only empty building t discussed at the meeting. The meeting heard how young people were putting themselves in danger by gaining access to Belleisle House One said: ”If we can show concern then the council can take action and step in..” And the meeting was told how youngsters were “masquerading around” Strathdoon House.

Now the proposition has got a whole lot dferent. Pet Heaven, a crematorium for family animals, has just opened in Ayr. And businessman Forbes Robertson believes it is the answer for many families who want to give their four legged - or two-legged in the case of birds - friends a splendid send-off. No expense has been spared in an -month project at the former commercial garage site in West Sanquhar Road. Area MP Bill Grant performed the official opening ceremony last week. The lavishly decorated gilded interior includes a parlour where families can pay their last respects. Entrepreneur Forbes, who has business interests throughout the area, revealed up to  people can attend the pet funeral services . Mourners can watch as their pet recedes behind the final curtain at the close of the service, similar to what would happen in a human ceremony at Masonhill. As yet Pet Heaven cannot handle horses, but the biggest of dogs to cats, hamsters and birds. There is a tea and coffee service as well as any choice of music desired and a book of remembrance in the reception area.  Much of the interior decoration has been gathered by Forbes, a keen antique hunter and auction room collector. The company will offer a collection service as well as provide a selection of remembrance urns for ashes. It seems no expense is spared by some dog lovers in the UK and recently a couple spent pound on a full funeral including a horse drawn glass hearse. Forbes said: “People sometimes care more about their animals than humans. “A farmer who contacted me askedhis dog goes before him, the animal would be cremated here and I will store the ashes. “He told me his lawyer would be in touch as he wanted buried with his dog. “Pets are loyal, they don’t steal from you and are there first thing in the morning and last thing at night.” MP Bill Grant said Pet Heaven was a signicant investment for the area. He said: “I am sure this will be welcomed by pet owners from all over the southwest, pet owners who have lost their best friend. “To have a dignied departure for that pet who has been their friend - in some cases for  years - is a great service. “The set-up Mr Robertson has here is wonderful and I think he can be proud of it. “That last journey for pets will be full of dignity and respect from Pet Heaven and its staff. “Indeed my family had a wee dog Blackie for  years and I don’t mind admitting, then a senior fire officer, that I cried unashamedly for an hour at the loss of our companion”.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrPetsSanquharAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"cold-weather-makes-it-harder-for-us-to-get-out-of-bed-says-survey","story":"Chilly winter mornings lead usto spend an extra  hoursin bed over the colder months - just from hitting the snooze button.Weneed an extra  minutes in bed each morning during winter before wefeel brave enough to face the cold, according to a new survey.Of those surveyed who are currently employed,  per cent thought they were more likely to be late for work in the winter months because they found it harder to get up in the morning.Andof that %,the average worker will be late for work seven times in the course of an average winter because they overslept.One in five have been so cosy they have pulled a sickie to have a duvet day instead.A spokesperson for Andrews Heat for Hire, which commissioned the study, said: ldquoDarker, colder mornings can make waking up in winter months more challenging than any other time of the year.ldquoAnd while an additional quarter of an hour snoozing each day doesnrsquot seem like a big sacrice, over the course of the winter we lose an entire day to those few extra minutes in bed.Regionally, Scots are the quickest to get up and face the day when the weather turns, spending  minutes extra in bed, while those living in Yorkshire are fondest of their covers, resisting the cold until theyrsquove had  extra minutes dozing.One in two Brits find it harder to get themselves out of bed in winter more than any other time of year, and a third think they are more likely to hit the snooze button when the mornings are dark and cold.And seven in  said a few more minutes with their duvet is too tempting when the weather outside looks chilly.To read the full results of the study, visitandrews-sykes blog.Three in five of those questioned make it tougher to leave their beds by taking actions to make their set-up as warm and comfortable as possible.Of these,  per cent will buy a thicker duvet when the weather begins to turn, and  per cent will put an extra blanket on the bed to keep the cold away.More than seven in  even have the foresight to set their heating to come on before they wake up so their home is warm when they wake, clicking on  minutes before they stir.One in five of those surveyed have been so attached to their bedspread they have been late for a meet-up with friends or loved ones - and will also cancel six gatherings entirely over a typical winter because its too cold.Nearly one in two Brits are unable to shake their hibernation instincts when the temperature plummets and spend more time in bed during the winter than any other time of year.Three in  find themselves going to bed earlier as the evenings draw in sooner, and one in eight set their morning alarms later than they usually would to grab a few extra minutes before feeling the chill.A spokesperson for Andrews Heat for Hire, who comissioned the survey, said: ldquoWith a cold snap predicted over the coming weeks,duvets are only going to become even more inviting.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion.ldquoPeople have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

around Candlemas and one of the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull

most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

There are a number of reasons for that because the backstop is really designed to keep the UK as a whole in the customs union and the single market that does not honour either her own manesto or the outcome of the referendum.Reacting to the PMrsquos backstop comments in Belfast, a source from the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs said: \"Evenshe doesnt mean what she said, we still do.\"Today, the so-called Alternative Arrangements Working Group, chaired by Stephen Barclay, the Brexit Secretary, and attended by senior Leavers and Remainers in the Conservative Party, is due to meet again to try to flesh out details of the so-called Malthouse Compromise.This involves replacing the backstop with a free trade agreement, involving technological solutions to avoid customs checks on the Irish border and extending by a year the post-Brexit transition period until December .Askedthe PM would go to Brussels on Thursday with a fully-formed Plan B, her spokesman said: ldquoI have never got into that and am not going to do that today.\"At the weekly Cabinet, Mrs May urged senior colleagues to stop speculating about delaying Brexit, stressing how such talk was ldquocounterproductive.Her exhortation came just  hours after a Cabinet minister told The Herald it was now ldquoless likely Britain would leave the EU on March  as planned because of the lack of parliamentary time to get the necessary legislation through Westminster by exit day.This throws up the possibility the planned Valentinersquos Day vote on a motion will involve an amendment to extend Article  to, say, the summer a move the EU would have to agree to.Meanwhile in Edinburgh, it emerged Nicola Sturgeon is to convene a special Brexit Cabinet meeting as her government steps up preparations for a no-deal outcome.The First Minister will discuss contingency planning with her ministers next Wednesday, the day before MPs are due to hold another Brexit vote.Later today, Michael Russell, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Brexit Minister, is due to tell Holyrood more about the SNP administrationrsquos no-deal preparations."},{"url":null,"title":"former-fm-lord-mcconnell-proposes-new-nations-and-regions-department-alongside-uk-council-of-ministers","story":"Appearing before the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee inquiring into intergovernmental relations, the former First Minister, now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, insisted there needed to be ldquofundamental change in the power structures of the UK, which would include a new Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, overseeing a new department, who would be a ldquoDeputy Prime Minister-type inidual, of that standing within Cabinet.Within the department there would be a Scotland Office, a Welsh Office and a Northern Irish Office to handle the territorial s as well as an office for local government because, the Labour peer argued, the English regions were currently under-represented.Alongside that Lord McConnell proposed a UK Council of Ministers to decide on areas where there would be shared legislative responsibility post-Brexit.Crucially perhaps, he suggested each of the four representatives should have equal standing and pointed to the EU, where there was ldquoshared sovereignty. The Council would make joint decisions for the UK in shared areas, giving \"proper respect and weight\" to all involved on areas such as fishing and agriculture.Askedhis proposal would give the Scottish Government a veto over UK Government decisions, the Labour peer argued majority voting could apply to the decisions of the Council, admitting that would \"seriously threaten the sensibilities of the UK Government\".He went on: ldquoIf you had these two structures in place, then after  years[of devolution] and after Brexithellipthe UK would look much more like a multi-national governmental structure, which it should be, given the legislative autonomy there now is in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The former Scottish Labour leader, who was First Minister between  and , made clear the Scotland Office - now officially dubbed the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland ndash should be abolished and noted how he was \"surprised...there was still a Secretary of State for Scotland\" following devolution in .His former Government colleague, the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Wallace of Tankerness, backed plans for a UK Council of Ministers to deal with the ldquonew reality of a strengthened devolved settlement.The former Deputy First Minister also questioned the power of the Scotland Office, telling MPs: \"I suspect[David Lidington, the Cabinet Office Minister and Theresa Mayrsquos de facto deputy] carries more clout for Scotlands interests than Mr Mundell does no disrespect to Mr Mundell.ldquoI dont think we would be have been any worse off in the early days of devolutionthe Scotland Office had disappeared,\" he declared.Following the meeting, a UK Government spokeswoman said: \"The Secretary of State for Scotland and his office play a vital role in ensuring Scotlands voice is heard at the heart of Whitehall and that the UK Governments responsibilities and activities in Scotland are fully understood.\"Elsewhere in the committee hearing, Sir Peter Housden, the former head of the civil service in Scotland, recalled how relations between senior members of the UK and Scottish Governments \"could not have been more tense\" at times during the  independence referendum campaign.John Lamont, the Conservative committee member, asked him: \"Thinking back to  and the referendum, is it fair to say that relations between the two governments were quite tense \"Sir Peter replied: \"Well, interestingly, yes and no. At senior level they could not have been more tense on occasions but nevertheless there were important channels of communication that were being held open.\"I saw it as my responsibility, with officials in the UK Government, to keep those channels open.Meanwhile, Lord Wallace claimed Tony Blair, the then Prime Minister, \"spent most of the time looking out the window\" during Joint Ministerial Committee meetings with Scottish Government leaders.He said: \"I remember meeting in Edinburgh, in Cardf and by the time it came to the third meeting in Downing Street, I dont think Im exaggerating to say that Tony Blair spent most of the time looking out the window.

It was windy that night too and a lot of people who fly drones have told me it wouldrsquove been too windy that night to fly one.Keith Banks, an amateur meteorologist who writes a monthly weather column for the John OrsquoGroat Journal, says mphgusts were blowing during the period the UFO was witnessed.ldquoIn my view the very blustery conditions would have effectively precluded a drone from flying, he said.Dedicated drone flyers agree, including Barry Scollay from Wick who says he has been flying the unmanned aerial vehicles for a decade.ldquoNo way a drone would have flown in those winds ndash thatrsquos a certain fact, said Mr Scollay, who has a Facebook page called Highland Aerial Views which has over , followersldquoIt would have to have been able to maintain its location in high winds.

Itrsquos just not as clear with the phone.The object disappeared not long after a police van appeared at around am.ldquoI couldnrsquot get to sleep and kept going to the window and the door to see it but it was gone, he says.Since posting the video online he has had numerous calls from self-professed ldquoUFO investigators.Therersquos been so many of them, he says hersquos now ldquovery waryof callers who ask ldquotoo many questions.ldquoItrsquos like being interviewed by the FBI, he said. ldquoVery weird and over the top with the secrecy.Since his sighting, an organisation called the British Earth and Aerial Mysteries Societyhas said it believes he saw an ldquointerdimensional plasma craft.The craft have also been suggested as a cause for recent disruptions at Gatwick and Heathrow airports.A spokesperson for Wick John OrsquoGroats Airport confirmed that it was closed during the period the object was sighted, and there are also no reports of the emergency services operating in the air at that time.Charliersquos video can be seen at https:youtu.be xdHBiqtkWhat do you think he saw  Email d.scott@nosnwith your suggestions.Wednesday  Feb  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Flexibility plea on new GP deal","story":"THE problems facing GPs in Caithness have been outlined to Scotlandrsquos health secretary Jeane Freeman by two north MSPs.Rhoda Grant and David Stewart.Labour representatives for the Highlands and Islands, met with Ms Freeman to express their concern about the new GP contract and the impact it could have on rural and remote areas.They were accompanied by Phil Wilson, a professor of primary care and rural health at the University of Aberdeen and a GP in Inverness.Also present was a Dingwall GP Miles Mack.Mrs Grant asked Ms Freeman for the face-to-face meeting at the Scottish Parliament and highlighted issues which GPs across the Highlands and Islands have raised with her and Mr Stewart.The doctors told the minister that five of the  permanent GPs in Caithness are likely to retire in the next five years.Ms Freeman heard that since  almost half of all permanent GP posts in the county have been vacant and partially replaced with short-term locum provision.Three practices have ceased to be independent contractors and have been taken over by NHS Highland.Concerns were also raised about the capacity for undergraduate teaching and the effect on retention and recruitment of GPs in remote areas.Doctors have told the MSPs that the new contract fails to recognise the workload in rural areas where surgeries deal with a far greater range of medical problems, including emergencies that would be dealt with in hospitals in urban areas.Mrs Grant said: ldquoThe main concern is that whatrsquos on the table with the new contract is an urban model and this just doesnrsquot suit remote and rural areas.ldquoGPs are worried it will cause poor continuity of care for patients and that procedures currently performed at surgeries are being centralised ndash for instance for blood tests or vaccinations.ldquoThis will inevitably inconvenience patients and worsen health outcomes by raising barriers to care.ldquoThe contract states that other healthcare professionals will be employed to deal with these extra tasks ndash but with rural GP posts remaining unfilled, and shortages of nurses in many areas, how can we expect to find these extra people in our out-of-the-way places ldquoThere must be flexibility for GPs to retain the old system of care.The new contractrsquos funding formula has been based on the number of appointmentsand does not take account of the issues faced by rural areas such as patient and doctor travel.ldquoGPs in our region cannot wait for another three years to see some movement on this and Irsquom hopeful that the health secretary will find a suitable way forward.At the meeting Ms Freeman said she had ldquogenuinely taken the issues seriously and discussion would continue with colleagues.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

In addition, D photogrammetry is taking place so that digital D models of the wreck can be produced. By using these techniques, in essence, the team is able to digitally bring HMS Royal Oak to the surface.Survey organiser and licence-holder Emily Turton said: “The wreck of HMS Royal Oak is the final resting place of  men and boys. As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial. However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

has a silver lining but jobs are going overseas stuart murdoch","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nearly every major financial services firm has set up new offices outside the UK because of Brexit, writes Stuart Murdoch.Regardless of where the Brexit process ends up,it even happens at all, the fact is that it has already had a material and probably irreversible impact on the financial services sector in Scotland.Major financial institutions never stand still, constantly reviewing and updating their strategies to react to changes in their customers needs, challenges from competitors and regulatory updates.Global businesses are used to dealing with geopolitical uncertainty, and adapting to it.That’s why despite the lack of detail around the Brexit withdrawal agreement, and no matter what the finalised deal looks like, many companies in Scotland’s financial services sector have already moved to prepare themselves for all eventualities.Nearly every major Scottish financial services institution has set up new offices outside the UK, or have relocated staff historically based in the UK to existing offices where: Standard Le and Aviva to Ireland RBS to Frankfurt and Scottish Widows to Luxembourg are just a few examples of redeployment. These moves are hugely intensive and provide a short-term boost for local workers and the economy. Such projects also develop the expertise and credibility of Scotland’s already impressive pool of financial services talent. : Nicola Sturgeon: Real and growing risk of no-deal BrexitHowever, that fact remains that much high-value work generated by exporting financial services to the EU is draining out of the Scottish economy permanently.On the other hand, there are new opportunities emerging as a direct result of the Brexit effect – for example firms are bringing some foreign operations back to Britain. Whilst the inward surge is not expected to match what is being lost, we are seeing a trend of UK and foreign firms relocating parts of their business to the UK to ensure they can continue to support their UK customer base. This includes many UK insurers who had previously set up offshore subsidiaries.The driver for larger UK firms moving operations to the EU is to satisfy their European customers, who are seeking assurances that there will be no disruption to their services in the event that no withdrawal deal is reached.However, some customers have raised concerns about whether they will get the same levels of consumer protection as offered in the UK – such as the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.We are advising a range of organisations, including a number of high-growth, financial technology businesses, who are planning their international growth strategy with Brexit in mind. We are seeing particularly high levels of activity in the payments industry. Many expanding fintech businesses in Scotland have an ambitious global outlook.: Brexit: Queen to be evacuated in event of no-deal, reports claimIt would be much simpler for them to grow abroadthe EU wasn’t to suddenly become a ‘foreign’ jurisdiction. On the other hand, many of these firms already have processes in place to manage a truly international business. For those companies, the potential barriers to exporting financial services to EU are relatively simple to plan for.International trade in financial services is particularly restricted by the requirement of firms to be authorised to undertake regulated activities. This is why Brexit is a serious issue for the financial sector to contend with. Currently we are part of a common regulatory regime, so any firm authorised to provide financial services in one EU member state can effectively get permission to conduct business in any other member state, using a mechanism known as ‘passporting’. When we are no longer in the EU, UK firms will lose their rights to passport their permissions to the EU. UK firms will be subject to the same restrictions as other firms from where across the globe.The UK will be eligible to apply for equivalence in a limited number of regulated activities, but this process is not automatic. It requires the approval of the European Commission, which could take considerable time and be subject to political obstacles. If an equivalence is approved for the UK, there would be a requirement to maintain close alignment to the EU financial services regulations. The Commission has the discretion to withdraw their approval at any time, which would provide little certainty for UK firms.On the flipside, any EU firm wanting to trade here will have to satisfy the UK’s own rules. Even though no deal has been agreed at the moment, the UK Government has thus far given assurances that regardless of what happens we’ll continue to give EU firms the opportunity to continue trading whilst applying for UK permissions up to March . They must noty the UK regulators in advance of Brexit to get the temporary permissions, but this gives more certainty to EU firms trading here than the other way around as it stands.If we are looking for positives where there are some short-term benefits of a weaker pound, which helps keep inward investment into the UK on the radar as an appealing prospect, but there is a bigger foreign exchange risk for the future should our economy and currency value begin to erge signicantly from mainland Europe.We have been helping our clients to review their businesses in order to better understand how Brexit will affect them.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

The film is a nature study that follows a young girl and her encounters in the woods over one night, having lost her way from her family campsite. It is a lyrical and delightful portrait of a child’s perspective of the natural world.Last year ATLAS installed it in the south wing of Dunvegan Castle and ran an educational workshop programme with Portree Primary School and Portree High School.This year they are hosting cross-generational screenings with primary aged girls, similar age to the young girl in the film and the elderly generation. The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLASArts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap.

Most recently our primary seven girls have taken part in film screenings of Eglantine, both at Dunvegan Castle where they were able to hear directly from Margaret Salmon, and more recently at Home Farm and Tigh Na Drochaid, where they have been able to enjoy the film in a cross-generational context.She added: #As with all projects we have been involved in with ATLAS Arts, our pupils have been impacted very positively by these experiences.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives.

Up stepped Peter Henvey and his shot was well-struck high into the net to tie the game at -.Carryduff made the perfect response as from the restart, they moved straight upfield with Beatty getting on the ball, finding Ciaran Sherry who broke through and squared for Darragh Connolly who rose to palm into the net and restore his side#s three-point lead.Beatty and Owen McCabe added points as it appeared Carryduff were set to pull away, but St Brigid#s refused to break as John Blaney and Rory Brolly kicked scores to get them back to within three.Beatty and Finnegan traded points while Beatty added another from play to make it a four-point game with seven to play, but St Brigid#s were far from done.Five minutes from time, substitute Paul Bradley gathered Peter King#s long ball and waited for movement inside. He spotted James Smith in space and played a high ball that Smith rose to meet and brilliantly palm to the corner of the net.Again, Carryduff went upfield and found the net when Beatty put Connolly in on the right, but while his shot was destined for the net, substitute Eoin Rooney decided to make sure of it by getting his foot to it. However, Rooney was well inside the small square before the ball and the effort was correctly ruled out for a square ball.St Brigid#s took full advantage as they swept upfield and Smith thumped over a great point to level with three to play.Once more, Carryduff were able to respond. This time, Guinness created space  meters out and his shot curled just inside the post with the referee # standing right behind the shot # overruling the umpire who waved it wide.St Brigid#s still had time to save themselves, but they couldn#t engineer a score as Carryduff broke away and almost sealed their win, but Rooney#s shot crashed off the crossbar to give the Antrim champions one last chance. But with the whistle in referee Martin Conroy#s mouth, it was now or never and Brolly had to shoot from an unfavourable distance, the effort tailing right and wide as Carryduff held on.CARRYDUFF: D Ross L Toal, G Henderson, C Cunningham J McGeough , D Coogan, D GuinnessP Laverty , J ConneryR Anderson , O McCabe , P Loughran D Connolly , R Beatty , C Sherry.

She added: “We have now narrowed the issue down to the backstop, they know that’s the problem, they have been told that for some considerable time but unfortunately they are turning their face against that and it is time for Brussels to respect Unionism in Northern Ireland. “We have heard a lot about them understanding the Belfast Agreement, that they don’t want a hard border on the island of Ireland but they are quite content to build a hard border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, thereby interfering with the constitution of the UK. “That is wrong as well and they need to recognise that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leo varadkar discussing nodeal brexit with eu leaders in brussels","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its understood the proposal was given consideration among Government officials but dismissed as there would have been a need for a hardening of the border with infrastructure.The EU and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have previously stated there are no technological solutions currently available.

The plan also proposed: Tarfs could be paid online by registered users, Police would monitor every goods vehicle that crosses the border to clamp down on smuggling,Inspection depots away from the border which suspicious drivers ordered to re-route to.The system could have been trailed before the departure Brexit day on March  with  hauliers testing it.The report states the Governments working group on finding alternative arrangements has also been briefed on a possible solution in Africa aimed a stopping bandits and hijackers operating on the borders of Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.MLA Stephen Farry added: \"If this is for real, those behind it have no understanding of the complexities of the Irish border and the impact of this level of surveillance. And from a business point of view, it is hard to see how this copes with the need for regulatory checks in relation to agri-food sectorHe added: \"The only way to avoid a border is for either the whole of the UK or Northern Ireland alone to be in same customs zone and maintain sufficient level of regulation with the EU.\"In an examination of the proposal the political sociologist academic Katy Hayward said number recognition cameras could be targets for attacks, as the PSNI has warned, and there would need to be a willingness from those crossing the border to be tracked. She suggested analysing social media posts or other information could ride roughshod over privacy and data protection rules. \"After trouncing personal privacy and data protection rules... what happens  Inspection by robot ,\" she tweeted.\"Looking at tech at this stage is like buying a tent without any tent poles or pegs. What customs and regulatory framework is this tech to fit over and facilitate \"Then, the more dferent it is to now , the greater the stretch for tech and credibility.\"Fujitsu refused to comment on the leak, although it has in the past admitted to examining possible solutions for the border.A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the EU said the Government was exploring a number of possible options to solve the Irish border issue. \"As the Political Declaration makes clear, the UK and the EU have committed to exploring what alternative arrangements to the backstop might look like.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins.

He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised.

Photo: LIAM MCBURNEY AFP Getty ImagesBut her words, which did not clary the future of Brexit as it relates to the Province, drew a critical response from local anti-Brexit parties, and failed to draw a warm reaction from unionists.And she sidestepped questions, including one from the News Letter, about the moderate unionist critique of the backstop from Lords Trimble and Bew that it breaches the  Belfast Agreement. In her -minute address, Mrs May said: “Over the last two-and-a-half years, we have come a long way towards a solution that works for Northern Ireland and Ireland. We have agreed mutual protections for citizens’ rights, the maintenance of our common travel area, and set a framework for our future relationship that ensures tarf and quota-free trade and protects our close co-operation on security and law enforcement.”But, she added,”the UK Parliament rejected the Withdrawal Agreement because of their concerns about the backstop”.Prime Minister Theresa May leaves after speaking with business representatives about Brexit and takinng questions from the media at Allstate in Belfast. Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireMrs May said: “I know that many people in Northern Ireland, and indeed across this island, are worried about what Parliament’s rejection of the withdrawal deal means for them. So I am here today to affirm my commitment, and that of the United Kingdom government, to all of the people of Northern Ireland, of every background and tradition.”She affirmed her commitment both to the “Belfast Good Friday Agreement” and to “delivering a Brexit that ensures noto a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – which is unshakable.”The prime minister was at pains to state “I was  when the Troubles began and  when the Belfast Agreement was reached for all my adult le, Northern Ireland has been a central political issue”.The decisive moment in the transformation away from conflict, she said, “was the Belfast Agreement in ”.“It enshrined the principle that it is the ‘birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identy themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose.“And it enshrined the consent principle: that it will always and only be for the people of Northern Ireland to decide what their constitutional future should be.”She said: “A fundamental belief in the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is part of my political heritage as a Conservative and unionist – and that will never change.Sam McBride: Amid an evasive Brexit fog, the backstop re-emerged after PM’s speechReported this week  years ago : Dublin society urges Linen trade to follow Dutch production methods Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“But the unionism I believe in is one that respects absolutely the central importance of Irish identity to those people in Northern Ireland who claim it.“Because the Belfast Agreement is not just the bedrock of stability here in Northern Ireland, its principles are fundamental to the security and success of the whole United Kingdom.“Our absolute commitment to those principles has informed and directed my approach to Brexit – from my first speeches as prime minister to my first meetings with the taoiseach.“And in December , in the Joint Report we agreed with the EU, we committed to protect the  agreement ‘in all its parts’.”She added: “Our preferred approach has always been to deliver them through the Future Relationship. But I accepted the need for an insurance policy or bridging arrangement to guarantee no hard borderthe FutureRelationship was not in place in time.”“That is why I agreed to the backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. And unlike the original European Commission proposal, it did not impose a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“Many people, businesses, farming organisations and voluntary groups in Northern Ireland agreed with me. They spoke out in support of the Withdrawal Agreement and they defended the backstop.”The prime minister said in her speech that she had fought hard for the Withdrawal Agreement “as it stands”.Theresa May said: “I believed it could command a majority in the House of Commons. But I have had to face up to the fact that in its current form it cannot. And the need for changes to the backstop is the key issue.“While there were those in Northern Ireland who spoke in favour of it, it is also true that the backstop is not supported by the two main unionist parties here. And this also influenced MPs in England, Scotland and Wales in voting against the deal.“I can only deliver on the commitments we have madeI can get a deal through the UK Parliament. And meetings with MPs across the House showed that I can only get a deal through Parliamentlegal changes are made to the backstop.”She acknowledged that changing the backstop “creates real anxieties here in Northern Ireland and in Ireland” and added: “I recognise, too, that the majority of voters in Northern Ireland voted to remain.”The prime minister said: “First, we stand by our commitment in the Joint Report that there will be no hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls. And this means people on either side of that border will be able to live their lives as they do now.”She added: “So while I have said that technology could play a part, and that we will look at alternative arrangements, these must be ones that can be made to work for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.“Second, neither will I compromise on my promise to protect Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK. “When the European Commission proposed a version of the backstop which involved creating a customs border in the Irish Sea, I successfully resisted it. And I have ruled out anyto such a suggestion.” It would, she said, “damage the integrity of the UK’s internal market”.• In full: Theresa May’s speech in BelfastShe added that “there will be no new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK without Northern Ireland’s institutions having their say”.Mrs May said: “Third, there will be full protection for all existing cross-border co-operation.”The prime minister then spoke about nationalist concerns, saying: “The birth right to identy and be accepted as British, Irish or both, and to hold both British and Irish citizenship is absolutely central to the agreement. “But I know that in some cases recently, people have encountered dficulties in securing their rights as Irish citizens to bring in family members.”The prime minister said she had asked the home secretary, working with Northern Ireland secretary, “to review these issues urgently”.Mrs May said “Without a devolved government – and with only unionists represented in the House of Commons – it is more important than ever that we uphold our duty to ensure all voices in Northern Ireland are heard.”“... So [on Wednesday] I will be sitting down with the political parties to discuss the way forward and ensure that we can deliver for all the people of Northern Ireland.”Mrs May said: “I have said many times that I want to see a new, deep and special partnership between the UK and the  member states of the European Union. “But our relationship with Ireland is deeper than our relationship with any of the other .”Setting out existing Anglo-Irish ties, she added: “We already have the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and regular summits between UK and Irish politicians. “But as we leave the European Union, we will need to establish new ways of coming together to develop further our unique relationship. “For example, the Irish government has suggested annual meetings where the prime minister and taoiseach, together with senior ministerial colleagues, come together to discuss the big issues of the day.”She said that “both the UK and the Irish governments have already made clear that we would support the tantalising possibility of a joint UK and Ireland World Cup bid for , should our respective football associations choose to pursue this”.She said that as the government seeks a deal that secures a majority in the Westminster Parliament, “which is the best way to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland”, she also hopes “we can ... move towards the restoration of devolution – so that politicians in Northern Ireland can get back to work on the issues that matter to the people they represent”.She said: “It must be how, together, we move forwards to shape the opportunities of the future.”• Political reaction, click here• Morning View: PM devoted to NI but focuses on land border•In full: Theresa May’s speech in BelfastJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"sam mcbride amid an evasive brexit fog the backstop re emerged after pm s speech  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+           TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat s News News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Sam McBride: Amid an evasive Brexit fog, the backstop re-emerged after PMrsquos speechPrime Minister Theresa May at a community centre during her visit to BelfastSam McBrideEmail Published::Wednesday  February Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Local\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

But there was disappointment for anyone hoping that with just over  days to go until Brexit day the prime minister was going to set out a clear pathway to securing a deal with the EU.Instead, with the point of departure from the EU within touching distance, Mrs May told the invited audience that she is now “working on a solution” to how Brexit will impact on the Irish border that will “command broader support across the community in Northern Ireland”.It was an attempt to be all things to all men which will have fuelled the fears of those who believe that she is out of ideas and cynically running down the clock in the hope that the looming reality of no deal prompts MPs to suddenly swing behind her deal.It took a question at the end of the speech to reveal something of what is really going on within government at this point. Asked by UTV’s political editor Ken Reid to explain how she could expect nationalists in Northern Ireland to accept a deal which does not include a backstop, the prime minister made clear that – contrary to what some Brexiteers had hoped – there will definitely be a backstop in any deal.She said: “Well, I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t include that insurance policy for the future.”That will concern some Brexiteers and some of the DUP who want to see the backstop removed in its entirety. Just two months ago, DUP leader Arlene Foster told Mrs May that she wanted to see her “bin the backstop”.But even that revelation from Mrs May was ambiguous. ‘A backstop’ couldmean almost anything and it is the specics of that arrangement which will be signicant.However, there is hope for Mrs May – at least from the DUP. When pressed yesterday, Mrs Foster refused to say that she is still demanding the removal of the backstop.It now seems that the DUP is prepared to accept a time-limited backstop, or perhaps some other mechanism. The real test of that will be the reaction of Brussels – and Dublin.Sinn Fein dodges questions over who paid for its Venezuelan tripPrime minister repeats her pledges to Northern Ireland but gives no clarity on Brexit Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things you should never EVER say or do to someone from Northern IrelandHas PSNI officer Bobby Singleton become an unwitting sex symbol Ian Ogle daughter: UVF gang that murdered Dad are still planning to kill my brotherVIDEO: Police investigation into fight at Belfast International Airport, AldergroveIN PICTURES: the funeral of Ian Ogle          ..

One of his historical advisors, Lord Bew, a very respected figure in the House of Lords, he said one of the most remarkable things was the British government had not challenged this Irish narrative on the Belfast Good Friday Agreement in recent years and I’m wondering what you think about that.Prime Minister Theresa May at Allstate in Belfast, where she spoke about her Brexit plans and took questions from the media. Photo: Liam McBurney PA Wire“He is concerned, like Lord Trimble, that Britain would be signing away the right, the possibility of there one day there being regulatory and customs ergence on the island of Ireland.Are you going to keep open that possibility for Britain ” Mrs May replied: “What I’ve made clear and you’ve heard me repeat in my speech, is the commitment that we made in the December joint report, December  joint report, to ensure Ireland’s place in the — the integral place that NI has within the internal market of the United Kingdom. We have already set forth, set out within Westminster, ways in which we believe as a UK government we would deliver on that.“I recognise the concerns that have been expressed about regulatory dferences but as I say, we were absolutely clear in that December joint report, and we retain our absolute commitment to that, to ensure Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK’s internal market.”Ken Reid of UTV asked:“Fty six per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain, it has wide support in the business community here as well. How are you going to persuade particularly nationalist politicians, the nationalist parties, to accept a deal that doesn’t contain a backstop ”Mrs May replied: “Well I’m not proposing to persuade people to accept a deal that doesn’t contain that insurance policy for the future.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If she is not prepared to do that, and we are at a situation where the executive and the Assembly isnrsquot up and running again, she has to put something in place.ldquoShe has to put direct rule in place come March  because Northern Ireland needs political leadership and it needs political direction.ldquoSo by March ,we are coming out with no deal with no executive, we need direct rule for Northern Ireland.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Wednesday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
