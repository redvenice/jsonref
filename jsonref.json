She talks about hidden trauma, ‘horrible’ language – and what the Covid crisis has revealedIn 2016, Elizabeth Price curated an ethereal, elusive exhibition called In a Dream You Found a Way to Survive and You Were Full of Joy. She chose work that was particular to her, close to her heart. On one level, it was about the idea of the horizontal. It was full of recumbent sculptures, queues, processions, dances, snowdrifts, ribbons, and flags. At the same time, it was infused with thoughts of sleep, dreams and death.“I was drawing on connections I’d been putting together over years and years, things that had been formative,” says the artist. “It was a view of what art can be, or what my relationship with art is.” Her latest exhibition, by contrast, has at its heart the idea of the vertical. For Slow Dans, a trilogy of multiscreen video works, she flipped the projector. Visitors to the large 19th-century assembly hall in which the show unfolds will see works on long, thin screens, 3 metres tall by 1.5 metres wide.“It was a simple reorganisation, the coordinates changing,” she says of Slow Dans, which was first seen in Manchester last year and now comes to London. But this flipping allowed her to “express the idea of depth, and shafts, and wells”. In these short but dense works – whose complex editing process she likens to lace-making (“holding 17, or 117, threads in place”) – she plays with objects and artefacts that are also long, thin and vertical: ties, pens, stiletto heels, gowns.Out of this melee emerges a trio of stories that have a funny, haunting tale to tell about labour and the world of work, about women’s place in that world, about the way society and technology have changed in Price’s own lifetime. (She is now 53.) It is a signature Price combination: formal ideas mingled with painstaking research, all transmuted into poetry by means of a fierce and rigorous imagination.We are speaking – at a judicious distance – in Price’s studio, a glassy flat in south London. For five weeks in the spring, she was ill with suspected Covid-19: one week properly ill, four weeks of “boring and exasperating” recuperation. Since recovering, she’s been working here in isolation. Without her studio assistant, “it all got a bit feral”. She’s done some tidying up, but the place is still littered with intriguing objects. On a table is a selection of mannequin legs – shop props for hosiery – that, en masse, have a dismembered creepiness. She doesn’t know how she’ll use them yet, maybe in some future artwork, but she has an eye for collecting “things of low value for which there is little recorded history”, things that speak of their time in some eloquent but unremarked way.This paraphernalia seems more reminiscent of a sculptor’s studio than a film-maker’s. But it is a reminder that Price worked in sculpture before starting to make video in her 40s, and still considers it her “disciplinary home – where all the best jokes are, the place in art school where all the shifting, awkward stuff goes”. She also had a brief but brilliant career in the late-1980s as the vocalist of indie-pop band Talulah Gosh, and worked in various administrative roles for London councils.In 2012, six years after she’d made her first video, Price won the Turner prize. When I interviewed her the day after, she said she had felt “very grave and unelated, and serious, and focused” receiving the award, which I think is a state of being for Price, who speaks with precision and a kind of detachment about her work that does not quite express its emotional force. She does, however, also have a well-chiselled sense of the ridiculous, and her videos can hum with humour.There are no jokes in the first of the trilogy, though. Kohl, which unfolds over four screens, takes as its material an extraordinary archive of photographs of coal-mining headgear, shot by a former pit worker in the 80s and 90s. While the surface-level signs of these structures have all but disappeared, the mines – “complex webs of subterranean architecture” – are still there. On a research trip to Wakefield’s National Coal Mining Museum, one former miner told her that the tunnels were so extensive you could walk all the way from Newcastle to Nottingham underground.Then another former miner told her, of course you couldn’t: mines would have been full of groundwater unless it was constantly pumped out, and “if you connected up all the coal mines, you would make this massive, surging, terrifying place of tides”. That gave her the nub of her ghostly little story, in which there’s a sense of a suppressed memory threatening to inundate us, “the rising-up of this liquid, like a symptom of a trauma from an injury long forgotten”. She relates it to how “inky spit”, as it was known, was the first “tell” of miners’ lung disease, another symptom rising up unbidden.Inkiness pervades the trilogy. The second video work, Felt Tip, weaves a subversive and hilarious fiction about the wearing of ties (items that are arranged into a nib-like V-shape) and the use of pens in offices. It is seen on two stacked vertical screens, reaching a height of nearly 6 metres – the perfect skinny format for its material.We see many ties in the video: Price has amassed, over 15 years, quite the collection. Dating from the mid-70s to the mid-80s, hers all have in common the imagery of computer technology – little squares or stripes or dotted lines that recall computer chips, or circuit boards. She remembers the first one she spotted, in a charity shop, with its chip-like design “in the place usually reserved for a crest. So that an image associated with the capacity of computers to store data had supplanted a memory of social provenance.”Felt Tip is narrated by a sometimes sardonic voice, one that seems to be confiding the secrets of a bored but intelligent female administrative cadre. An inspiration for the video was a book Price found in a charity shop, Sexuality and Class Struggle by Reimut Reiche, from 1968. It wasn’t the book itself – “well-researched, of its time” – that was intriguing. It was the annotations by a previous reader in purple felt-tip, “which seemed the most vulgar addition to this discourse, deliberately belligerent, and using the most trivial or feminised pen, big and fat and fleshy”.These sarcastic marginalia, full of exclamation marks and underlinings, were, she was certain, the work of a woman. “I’m interested in the radical impact of the postscript or addendum changing everything after the fact,” she says. “The interventions in that book altered it, rewrote it, and also resuscitated it, putting it to different use.” The voice of Price’s video is like that insistent wielder of the purple felt-tip – undermining an official view of patriarchal history with subversive and creative footnotes.In one sense, Price says, the story of her three videos is that “one is about manual work, one is about administrative work and one is about executive work”. These days, Price is a professor at Kingston University in London, and the third narrative of the trilogy, The Teachers, is a kind of science fiction tale: we hear various theories as to why a contagion of silence has crept through the professions, starting with university teachers.The idea is that at a certain point these executives have simply declined to speak, refusing – perhaps – to continue to use the ungainly language that corporate culture expects them employ. Instead, they begin to communicate through their bodies – through a series of gestures and wordless noises, through eloquent flicks of their dresses and gowns, which are beautifully evoked on the screen. Price is exasperated at this corporatisation of the language of academia. “The way it describes its processes and objectives is so horrible, and the only way to achieve anything in academia is to attempt to speak the language, so you talk about ‘outcomes’ and so on. You use this loathsome terminology. It’s the only way you can get resources for your students, so you parlay.”Slow Dans should have opened in May. A lot has happened since then, and I wonder how she feels its concerns will be read in the era of Covid-19. “We’ll have to see,” she says. “I guess all kinds of political consequences have come home in the crisis: impacts of austerity, the privatisation of the NHS. Others have become more visible, but are longstanding, deeper, like the impacts of structural racism, meaning the epidemic is more dangerous to some of us than others.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ddcb77cfec3daa91ecedf50ac652b795a233c5/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=387ad550e04962a4b47823f99bce65dc","title":"the tyranny of chairs","story":"Most chairs aren’t designed to serve human bodies – but a better seat is possible. By  Sara Hendren‘Let’s face the considerable evidence that all sitting is harmful,” writes Galen Cranz, a design historian whose book The Chair traces this object’s long history. Not all sitting, of course. For people who use wheelchairs, they’re an elegant and crucial technology. And sitting itself is not the culprit any unchanging, repetitive motion or posture fails to give the body the variation it needs. But Cranz, writing primarily for an audience of ambulatory readers in industrialised and therefore sedentary societies, is one of many researchers who have been saying for decades that chairs are a major cause of pain and disability.Sitting for hours and hours can weaken your back and core muscles, pinch the nerves of your rear end and constrain the flow of blood that your body needs for peak energy and attention. Most people’s bodies are largely unsuited to extended periods in these structures. Extensive research confirms that sitting in chairs is correlated, Cranz notes, with “back pain of all sorts, fatigue, varicose veins, stress and problems with the diaphragm, circulation, digestion, elimination and general body development”. There is growing evidence that relentlessly sedentary jobs – in some, such as bus driving and forklift operating, bodies are literally strapped to chairs – are harmful enough to shorten life expectancy.For most of human history, a mix of postures was the norm for a body meeting the world. Squatting has been as natural a posture as sitting for daily tasks, and lying down was a conventional pose for eating in some ancient cultures. So why has sitting in chairs persisted in so many modern cultures? As with all material objects, Cranz reminds us, function tells only part of the story. The other part, always, is culture – the inherited and sometimes arbitrary ways that things have always been done, and therefore continue as common practice. “Biology, physiology and anatomy have less to do with our chairs than pharaohs, kings and executives,” she writes.One kind of historical chair, called the “klismos” by historians, developed primarily as a historical expression of status. Setting a body higher than and apart from other people, in an inidual structure with rigid, flat planes – a throne, if you will – evolved as a way of recognising an inidual’s power, with the earliest known models dating to ancient Egypt and south-eastern Europe. Their use as an expression of authority continued throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and the endurance of this symbolism lives on as metaphor in many contemporary leadership titles to chair the committee or the department, or to sit in the designated “director’s chair” on a film set, is still to hold a seat of power.In the centuries prior to western industrialisation, stools or benches were common household furnishings, but chairs were special-occasion objects, usually the exclusive property of the wealthy and powerful. The era of mass manufacturing in the 19th century, and the rapid social and economic changes that came with it, brought chairs into daily life for the first time. Industrial jobs, with their repetitive tasks, required a seated posture, and the high demand for chairs that this created in turn made them available and affordable to middle-class people in Europe and the US.“Chair-and-table culture,” Cranz writes, has become fully entrenched in many parts of the world since then. Modern interior designers have done their part to perpetuate chairs as a fashionable and practical norm, reinventing the form again and again in its aesthetics, though not nearly enough in its ergonomics. Chairs are four-legged creatures with anatomical backs and bottoms, familiar to humans because they stand up, almost like animals, beckoning us with their lifelike structures to sit down. Cranz notes that they appeal to humans, and perhaps especially designers, with this blend of the “architectonic and the anthropomorphic”: they are structurally interesting and an echo of the body itself.But while they remind us of the human form, chairs rarely do much to actually support it. For instance, many chair designs feature big, soft cushions that seem to indicate comfort, but in ergonomics, the consensus contradicts this padded aesthetic. Cranz writes that “an overpadded chair forces the sit bones to rock in the padding rather than make contact with a stable surface, thereby forcing the flesh in the butt and thighs to bear weight”.How can a nice cushioned chair that screams comfort be so ill-suited to most actual bodies? The real science of ergonomics, Cranz argues, should point designers toward chair design that supports and enables the body’s need for movement, not stillness – with seats that angle downward in front, for example, and have a base that’s flexible enough for the sitter to shift their body weight from leg to leg. But for the most part, these principles are ignored in favour of fashion and cheap manufacturing.Chairs are generally not a response to the realities of the body, its natural evolution, or its needs over any extended period. Instead, the industrialised body has devolved in its needs and succumbed to chairs. “We design them,” Cranz writes, repurposing a famous line of Winston Churchill’s, “but once built, they shape us.”Naturally, there have been plenty of attempts by designers to reinvent sitting. There are kneeling chairs, bouncing balls, perch-style stools with rounded bottoms to encourage shifts in weight and movement. There are flexibly designed chairs such as the Tripp Trapp for children, with pegs for adjusting the seat and leg supports to grow with a young body. Some offices have started to introduce standing desks. But at the average restaurant, in the ordinary classroom, and on trains, buses and aeroplanes, you’ll still find chairs that are mostly at odds with any idea of comfort.It’s not just chairs, of course – so many of the products brought to market by the profession of industrial design were not created for many bodies. Instead, they were designed to be plentiful, novel rather than necessary, and cheap. One famous designer, Victor Papanek, memorably dubbed these bad designs a form of “do-it-yourself murder”.“Never before in history have grown men sat down and seriously designed electric hairbrushes, rhinestone-covered file boxes, and mink carpeting for bathrooms, and then drawn up elaborate plans to make and sell the gadgets to millions of people,” he wrote in 1971. “Today, industrial design has put murder on a mass-production basis. By designing criminally unsafe automobiles that kill or maim nearly 1 million people around the world each year, by creating whole new species of permanent garbage to clutter up the landscape, and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air we breathe, designers have become a dangerous breed.”Papanek was calling out his entire profession when he wrote these words. Design for the Real World, his first book, was a fiercely argued polemic about the misguided operations of industrial design in the mid-20th century, a call for designers to question what Papanek witheringly referred to as “shroud design” – a preoccupation with the way things look on the outside, at the expense of how they should function and how robustly and sustainably they are made. He understood how the products with which we navigate daily life match (or fail to match) the bodies and tasks they are meant to conjoin as tools. He likened his peers’ shirking of their responsibilities to “what would happen if all medical doctors were to forsake general practice and surgery, and concentrate exclusively on dermatology and cosmetics”.Papanek was responding to the heady early days of truly mass manufacturing in the aftermath of the second world war, when supply chains expanded to previously unimaginable scale, fuelled by an equally huge advertising industry. Papanek understood the job of product design to be an ambitious one – to “transform man’s environment and tools and, by extension, man himself” – but he saw in the giddiness of postwar growth a moment when designers lost their way. An overwhelming cultural belief and investment in technology created a cultural appetite for whatever seemed shiny and new, and the industry now pandered to it.The public’s ready acceptance of these shiny new objects, whose life was meant to last only until the next new thing arrived, created an allegiance among designers to what Papanek called “the dark twins of styling and obsolescence”. Manufacturing for styling, amplified by advertising, resulted in an empty desire for unnecessary objects that became quickly unusable. And objects that were created purely for ephemeral desire, in turn, created a whole ethos of obsolescence – an accepted disposability that made for a dangerous neglect of safety standards, resulting in needless injury from common household objects. At the time of his writing, he claimed that 600 women annually lost a hand in injuries brought about by top-loading washing machines. When operating at its worst, design resulted in needless injury, but in its everyday mediocrity it also created conditions where objects were not in harmony iwth the needs of the people for whom they were designed.As Papanek observed, there is a wide gulf between the people who use TV remotes, car dashboards and other everyday items, and the people who make the design decisions that bring those items into being, who are driven or constrained by motives other than ease of use. The bodiedness of people gets lost, especially in the sedentary workplace, where human labour is imagined not as flesh and muscles, but as measurable economic deliverables, organised by roles and tasks. Yet the work is carried out by bodies all the same, not just in chairs, but among the angular shapes of desks and copiers and countertops, alongside mechanical and digital machines. The passive as well as active physical requirements of our workdays tax our bodies, whether we bend repeatedly to harvest berries or sit still in a phone bank for hours on end.Post-Papanek, designers continued to wrestle with the conundrum of chairs. In the late 70s, the office furniture giant Herman Miller commissioned independent designers Bill Stumpf and Don Chadwick to look for opportunities in the furniture market, gaps that new products might fill and thereby expand the company’s market share. In the course of their research, Stumpf and Chadwick, seasoned observers of humans and designed environments, noted one particular context in which chairs were creatively adapted but ill-suited to their sitters: older adults who spent a lot of their day sitting in La-Z-Boy recliners, watching TV or doing otherwise passive activities.They noted that the recliner had even become a makeshift medical treatment chair they witnessed it being used, for example, in a half-reclined state for people undergoing dialysis treatment. Despite the advantages of its variability in pitch and support structures, however, it was the wrong chair for many of the conditions that come with ageing. Older adults with weakened muscles had trouble getting in and out or reaching the lever for changing positions, and the deep padding, used for its presumed comfort, put people who sat for long periods at risk of bedsores.Inspired by the spirit of the recliner, Stumpf and Chadwick reconsidered all of its traditional features and generated a prototype called the Sarah chair , which they pitched to Herman Miller in 1988. It had all the flexibility of a recliner and more – multiple ways to choose the pitch of the back, seat and arms, and a flexible footrest for changing positions more easily. They reduced the padding significantly, making a thinner and more breathable seat structure. The model was popular in-house as a chair with purpose – many Herman Miller staff could imagine it being useful for their grandparents, for example. But the mass-market appeal wasn’t obvious at first, and the firm rejected the Sarah in its first iteration, only to revive the design a few years later.For the second version, Stumpf and Chadwick imagined the ergonomic features of the chair with ageing still in mind, but also the body of the average office worker, commonly tethered for long stretches to a personal computer and keyboard. They got rid of the foam padding altogether, making the model’s signature new aesthetic a cushionless seat of thick plastic webbing that would support the shapes of any body, not just an ageing one. The Aeron was a wild success, quickly taken up as a status symbol in high-end office environments like those in Silicon Valley.Aeron chairs have become a canonical, if expensive, example of what’s called “universal” design and its variants, barrier-free and inclusive design. This principle is what many people think of when they hear the words “disability” and “design” together. The logic of universalism goes like this: designers gain surprising and powerful insights from looking closely not at norms and averages – not at people whose experiences fall well inside the expected middle of a curve – but instead at people and scenarios at the margins of experience, so-called extreme users. Good designers, the thinking goes, will take a close look at unusual circumstances, places where products (or environments, or services) are full of friction for people with particular needs. There, in the margins of human experience, are clues to suboptimal conditions that may also affect people in the normative middle, though perhaps to a lesser degree.In the case of disability, that would mean closely observing older adults and wheelchair users, and people on the autism spectrum, say, and then abstracting from those observations. What is working for these people, and what isn’t, based on what they say or do, or what they don’t say or do? Where might improvements be introduced to address those points of friction at the margins, the places where design isn’t working? After a series of prototypes and testing, the process aims to make a more user-friendly, ergonomic, accessible product (or service, or environment) for all – in principle, at least, design “for everyone”.It wasn’t Papanek who offered universal design to the world it was disabled people whose long-held insights generated what became a set of principles that designers could follow. Ronald Mace, a wheelchair user and architect, is credited with introducing the term “universal design” to the public in 1985. In part, the coinage was strategic, recasting features of design that had been considered “special” as simply good design, resulting in products and buildings that were straightforwardly “usable by all people”.The universal design principles that Mace and others in the disability community generated read like an antidote not only to the preoccupation with “styling and obsolescence” that Papanek called out, but also to the “murderous” results of negligent design they include principles such as “simple and intuitive use”, “perceptible information”, “low physical effort”, and perhaps most important of all, “tolerance for error”.Universal design isn’t restricted to high-end items such as the Aeron chair. If you go looking for kitchen tools in your average store, for example, you’ll easily find the Oxo Good Grips line, with the familiar thick black pliable rubber handles that have just enough give to hold comfortably, and just enough sturdy resistance to offer leverage. The brand began with a vegetable peeler, an object so everyday as to be invisible – and that peeler originated, as design often does, in a complaint that inspired an idea.In the late 80s, a woman named Betsey Farber was attempting to use a standard metal vegetable peeler in the holiday house she was renting with her husband, Sam, a retired entrepreneur. The tool was frustrating to use, especially because Betsey had arthritis. So, right there in the kitchen, Sam and Betsey started to sketch out ideas for a new version of a peeler. With further refinement, those ideas resulted in the now-ubiquitous Oxo design: fins on the sides elegantly indicate the place to put your thumb in order to optimise the mechanics of use, a visual cue for intuitive handling. When you hold the peeler against a carrot, it encourages you to apply just enough pressure to catch a ribbon of skin without cutting too deeply, and without a reckless amount of slip that would send both carrot and peeler flying from your hands.Sam Farber came out of retirement and went to work on the peeler, and the idea that he and Betsey hatched was taken up in a partnership with a product design firm that went on to create the Good Grips line: can openers, salad tongs and other tools made for the subtle work of manual kitchen tasks. Thus went a now-classic universal design success story, which has taken its place in the canon alongside that of the Aeron chair, as inspiration to a generation of would-be practitioners.There are other stories besides. Designer Marc Harrison was commissioned by Cuisinart in the late 70s to overhaul its commercial-grade food processor into a more consumer-friendly domestic model. The company didn’t ask Harrison to address disability as a use case for its product, but Harrison’s research and teaching at Rhode Island School of Design had included years of collaborative work on furniture for rehabilitation settings and wheelchair-accessible housing. Those experiences nourished the insights Harrison brought to the processor. He introduced things such as large-print, high-contrast lettering for the labels, and controls that flipped like paddles rather than requiring fiddly turning. These and other features were informed by usability principles Harrison had learned from looking closely at disability. This kind of commitment and imagination in design yields products and experiences that can make life better without you even noticing it.Disability is the little-acknowledged heart of the innovation in many digital tools, too. The history of the telephone, for example, is tightly bound up with research on deafness. Alexander Graham Bell’s work with deaf students and their teachers solidified his research on making speech visible, reducible to signals and therefore transmittable by electronic means. That research made telephone technology possible, but it also helped set in motion the standardisation of signal processing that was crucial to early computing.In the US, perhaps the most hidden-in-plain-sight of examples of these innovations is the landmark change to media consumption that happened after disability activists fought for closed-captioning technology to be built into every standard television. The Television Decoder Circuitry Act, passed in the US in 1990, required the technology to be a standard part of the television manufacturing process, rather than an extra device attached alongside it. The battle to pass the legislation was difficult and protracted, in the face of resistance from within the communications industry about the perceived extra expense it would entail. But thanks to the economy of scale created by the legislation, the cost of adding this capacity to televisions is now so small that it is almost impossible to calculate. Meanwhile, closed captioning has become a standard feature of daily life. It’s how you follow along with sports matches across a restaurant or airport terminal, and it’s how you understand clips from an election debate on your laptop with the sound off, making it possible to multitask when your kids are in the next room trying to get to sleep.It would be easy to conclude from these stories that universal design is dispatching “murderous” objects to the dustbin of history, and that it alone points the way to a more accessible future. Designing ergonomic objects that can be mass-produced and affordable enough to find their way into the hands of people who need them is an unassailable good. But disability scholars also point to the ironies created by the work that Mace and his ilk set in motion. One is that while the dominant model of universal design has disability at its centre, the very success of the innovations it generates tends to obscure their origin stories, as in the case of the Oxo peeler. That success makes many people overlook the barriers that still exist to an adaptive, flexible world for disabled people. Universal design also tends to stoke an unquestioned faith in the importance of products, attained by consumers, as the key to building a desirable world. A better product might be useful in the short term, but sometimes it’s a better process, or a better system, that’s needed to provide a long-term solution.Take, for example, the Leveraged Freedom Chair, a design created with paraplegic wheelchair users in parts of the world where accessible streets are rare. Amos Winter, director of the Global Engineering and Research Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), did years of trial-and-error field research with his team in Tanzania, Guatemala and India, in order to collaboratively design a chair with variable torque in driving, even in off-road terrain, using very simple technology. Depending on where you grab one of its extended handles, you get more or less mechanical advantage, just like switching gears on a bicycle, which makes uneven pavement or dirt roads much more navigable. A third wheel in front adds balance. “We failed a number of times,” Winter has said. The design process “has to start and end with end users”, he says. “These are the people who have to define the requirements of the technology, and give it the thumbs-up at the end.”Getting the seat, frame and handles in the right positions to be both comfortable and advantageous in their physics was an engineer’s task of very fine designing and building. But the real ingenuity isn’t in the mechanics it’s in the sustainable system for repair and maintenance. Many wheelchair companies make their chairs with their own proprietary parts, so even if they donate free chairs to people who need them, the parts are expensive to replace, and the chairs become unusable when they break. If a wheelchair is going to last in a rural area among populations who aren’t rich, says Winter, “it has to be repairable using the local tools, materials and knowledge in those contexts”. The Freedom Chair was made of globally standardised and affordable bicycle parts, so they can be repaired and replaced anywhere in the world.“To make something cheap and simple and reliable often takes rigorous engineering,” says Winter. “What is the solution that will give you the required performance for as little money and as little complexity as possible?” The Leveraged Freedom Chair was not a compromise it wasn’t a chair that was “good enough” for the people who use it. It was the right design for specific people in specific contexts, and it was designed to last. • Adapted from What Can a Body Do?

The home’s villainous matron, Gassbeek, is in cahoots with a vicious ship’s captain keen to adopt – really to enslave – them. The retro Dutch setting, the web of mysteries that landed them all there and the hairy, scary perils the children find themselves in set this winning series opener – about the families you make – apart.That rich historical setting is echoed in a new series by Pushkin Children’s Books called True Adventures, which reformats global tales of derring-do. One of the first out is Queen of Freedom by Catherine Johnson (Pushkin, £6.99), about a larger-than-life legend: Queen Nanny, the Boudicca of Jamaica, who is said to have caught bullets in her bare hands as she defended her freed people’s encampments from the British. Fast-paced, slim and with one reasonable use of the word “shit” to describe animal faeces, Queen of Freedom drills down into the tenacity of the freed slaves and the cunning lengths they went to to live free.Zana Fraillon wrote The Bone Sparrow, much feted in 2017. Her latest, The Lost Soul Atlas (Orion, £6.99), surfs the tweenYA border with its tale of young Twig, desperate to find his missing da in a bleak landscape that alternates between a familiar dystopia and the afterlife.The riddles that the dead Twig needs to solve, and his bone raven helper Kruuk, are very middle years. The perils he and his gang of hardscrabble friends face(d) – persecution by corrupt police and the local crime boss – might give a sensitive youngster pause. (Or perhaps it takes a much older reader to see the parallels with reality, until the afterword spells them out.) Fraillon’s lyrical style contrasts with the modern Dickensian setting the story is really about loyalty and the urgency of remembering.More noggin-busters enliven The Ten Riddles of Eartha Quicksmith (Firefly, £6.99, out 10 September), the inventive first fantasy novel of Loris Owen. Chess club stalwart Kip finds his way into a parallel plane, where kids like him attend an elite boarding school. Extraordinary eccentrics are the norm, surfing around on air-boards called “skimmis”. Leaving his dad behind is hard, and leaving his mum in the care home harder – but worth it, if Kip can find a cure for her suffering the after-effects of a lightning strike. But soon, Kip and pals are called upon to safeguard their new haven against sinister forces.Those forces abound in The Monsters of Rookhaven (Macmillan, £12.99 hardback, out 17 September) by the Carnegie-nominated Pádraig Kenny, in which the titular monsters actually have no parents: baby horrors just arrive in their gothic abode through some ectoplasmic woo-woo.The (much) older reader will thrill at how this book subverts hackneyed monster tropes with glee, and how Kenny drops an S-bomb on page one (“sibilance”), crediting readers with the wherewithal to handle a polysyllable.But make no mistake, this is a children’s book, in a big font size, magnificently illustrated by Edward Bettison. It asks: “Who are the monsters?” Some tasty humans (orphans!) accidentally arrive at the monsters’ gabled keep through a tear in the magical defences they are given asylum by Mirabelle, a monster with no superpower, upsetting the ancient status quo.Soon, though, the monsters’ modus vivendi is threatened by pitchfork-wielding villagers – and, worse, a soul-sucking reaper. The mortals – and Mirabelle – have to choose sides in this totally absorbing tale, where the most fearsome monster is one that reveals everyone’s deepest fears to all the others.• To order any of these books for a special price click on the titles or go to bookshop.

However, note that the white “business climate” line has still not rebounded to the level seen before the pandemic hit.The German business climate improved in August, according to the closely followed Ifo index.The index rose from a reading of 90.5 in July to 92.6 in August, the research institute said. That was higher than the 92.2 reading expected by economists.The economy is on a recovery course, but the economic upswing is still fragile, he warned.Good news for Devon: Infrastrata, the company that stepped in to save Belfast’s Harland \u0026amp Wolff shipyard, has bought the historic Appledore shipyard on the river Torridge.Appledore had been threatened with closure and the loss of 200 jobs after defence company Babcock International did not renew its lease in 2018. Infrastrata will pay £7m for the shipyard, which it will rename H\u0026ampW (Appledore). It hopes to focus on smaller vessels there for navies, while Belfast will focus on larger ships of more than 300m in length such as cruise ships. The Appledore shipyard traces its history back to 1855 and played a part in the shipbuilding effort during the second world war. Finablr, the embattled payments group, has delayed its accounts amid a probe into potential wrongdoing.The company had announced on 23 June that it had changed its accounting reference date to 28 February, giving it until 28 August to publish its financial statements.The company is currently unable to adhere to this deadline and will provide an update on the anticipated publication date when it is able to do so.Finablr appointed a law firm last month to investigate £1bn in undisclosed debt. The company was formerly the owner of the Travelex foreign exchange service, but lost control of it in April after it nearly collapsed.Last week the company announced that its Indian founder, BR Shetty, had resigned with immediate effect. Shetty was also the founder of NMC Health, the former FTSE 100 hospitals company that collapsed into administration in April after reporting billions more in undisclosed debt.Germany’s recession was not quite as deep as previously thought, according to revised GDP figures, but it was still the worst in the history of the reunified country.The drop is considerably larger than that seen even during the financial crisis of 2008-09.Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, an investment bank, said:Looking ahead, it does not take a rocket scientist to predict that the economy will have one of its best quarterly performances ever in the third quarter.

Even now, positive news on the relationship has the power to move markets.However, optimism over potential progress in the talks is likely to be tempered by the knowledge that Trump is likely to make the relationship with China central to his re-election effort ahead of November’s election.That election battle is now in full swing, with a Republican convention full of dark warnings about the future of the USA as it got under way last night. ’s Daniel Strauss reported: Monday night’s theme was officially the ‘land of promise’, but the collection of speeches offered an almost apocalyptic vision of what’s at stake in November’s elections In UK corporate news, drug company AstraZeneca said it has started phase 1 trials (with small numbers of participants) for a “monoclonal antibody combination for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19”.

Judging from the 15 years it took before a UN-appointed tribunal basically admitted its impotence on the latter event, there won’t be any official certainty about the circumstances of the terrible explosion at Beirut’s port in the foreseeable future. A few conclusions can, however. be drawn about this highly traumatic tragedy.The first is that, notwithstanding the blast’s particular circumstances, the responsibility for leaving 2,750  tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate warehoused in the heart of Beirut for no less than six years falls on the whole Lebanese ruling class – all those who have been in the Lebanese government during that period. Presidents, prime ministers, ministers of transport, chiefs of key security apparatuses and port administrators are all equally to blame. The list includes leaders of both the official Lebanese state and the parallel state constituted by Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is known to closely monitor Beirut’s airport and port and use them at its will.How did Lebanon get to this point? We need to take in 30 years of political and economic misrule to understand. Before 1975, when the civil war started, Lebanon was known to be a “fiscal paradise”: a country of wild capitalism, whose bank secrecy and sham taxation made it an ideal territory for money laundering, capital flight and all sorts of trafficking. The war ended with a political and constitutional agreement between Lebanese factions achieved in 1989 under the joint auspices of the Saudi monarchy and the Syrian regime. It was confirmed the year after by the latter’s participation in the US-led coalition that waged the first international war on Iraq from Saudi territory.During a dozen years, Lebanon was run by this Saudi-Syrian entente: representing the Saudi side, Rafik Hariri closely coordinated with Ghazi Kanaan, the all-powerful head of Syria’s security apparatus in Lebanon. Damascus’s opposition to the second US-led war on Iraq and the occupation of that country in 2003 led to the end of the entente. Washington started exerting pressure to expel Syrian troops from Lebanon, notably by sponsoring UN security council resolution 1559 of 2004 (Russia and China abstained in order not to veto it).Hariri’s assassination triggered a huge outpouring of popular anger, compelling Damascus to withdraw its troops. It kept pulling strings in Lebanon nevertheless, through a triple alliance composed of its close ally Amal, the Shia sectarian movement led by Nabih Berri, the Lebanese parliament’s speaker for life (he assumed office in 1992) Hezbollah, the Lebanese agent of Iran, Syria’s regional ally and Michel Aoun, Syria’s former bitter foe who about-turned in 2006.Over the past 15 years, Lebanon has basically been run by a renewed joint government, involving Rafik Hariri’s son Saad and the triple alliance, and continuing a disastrous economic policy of neoliberal reconstruction that had been in place since the end of the war. However, the war that unfolded in Syria since the 2011 Arab spring has considerably weakened Damascus and increased the role of Tehran and its Lebanese representative, as Iran gained the upper hand over Syria itself. This shift in the regional balance of forces translated into the election of Aoun as president in 2016. The botched attempt by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to twist Saad Hariri’s arm into ending collaboration with Tehran’s followers in 2017 was a clumsy reaction to this turn of events. In any event, the responsibility for the Lebanese economy’s collapse falls squarely on the whole spectrum of the country’s ruling class, all those who held offices over the past 30 years, as much as it falls on the banking sector with which they have all been enmeshed. Riad Salamé, the governor of Lebanon’s Central Bank since 1992 and still in place, embodies these entrenched problems. This shared responsibility was addressed by the now famous central slogan of the popular uprising that began on 17 October last year: “All of them means all of them.”With popular anger reaching a climax because of Beirut’s recent blast, there has been much hope in Lebanon for a silver lining to the tragedy in imposing two key demands of the October uprising on the ruling class: a government truly independent from it and new elections on the basis of a new electoral law. The expectation was that international pressure would force the implementation of these demands and provide a counterweight to the local ruling class.Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Beirut two days after the blast brought this expectation to a peak. Here was a leader who dared to mingle with the people right after the disaster, many thought, overlooking that it was a great photo-op for a French president beleaguered in his own country. The expectation did not last: Macron’s consistent line regarding the Middle East has been to mediate between the US and Iran (where French capitalist stakes are high), as he did when he attempted to organise a meeting between Donald Trump and Iran’s foreign minister on the margin of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e75e52d6bb94b84f18f49fcff74c82a2934aa98/0_60_1599_959/master/1599.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=93a28f92befc2b01d8f85813b24b4e15","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

Its embassy in Ecuador declared a “zero tolerance” policy towards illegal fishing, and this week it announced it was tightening the rules for its enormous flotilla with a series of new regulations.But with 325 of those 340 ships remaining off Ecuador, and local navy commander Darwin Jarrín saying last week that nearly half of those vessels had intermittently switched off their satellite communications – breaching the rules of the regional fisheries management organisation – the episode has shown how difficult it is for small nations to stand up to China’s distant fleet even when it descends on the archipelago that inspired Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.China’s vast fishing fleet, by far the world’s largest, has been overfishing seas much further from the world’s gaze than the islands known for their giant tortoises and iguanas. From West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea to the Korean peninsula, the fleet has moved into the waters of other countries – switching off transponders to avoid detection, depleting fish stocks and threatening food security for often poor coastal communities. In east Asia, fishing vessels may act as the vanguard of an aggressive geopolitical strategy aimed at asserting territorial claims.China’s new regulations this week include harsher penalties for companies and captains involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated – or IUU – fishing. But conservationists monitoring the Galápagos episode are sceptical.“Beyond this one-sided announcement, the problem remains the same,” says Pablo Guerrero, marine conservation director for WWF Ecuador. “These boats operate without observers on board, they do not return to port, they transship their catch to mother vessels, which land the catch at ports. So, in a nutshell, they are fishing all the time, the fishing operation doesn’t stop.”The fleet is a vast and complex network. Among the hundreds of vessels are fuel providers, fishing boats, tender boats and reefers, some of which camouflage unregistered boats, Guerrero says. Many ships spend long periods at sea where shocking human rights violations have been reported.NGO Global Fishing Watch and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) thinktank have used cutting-edge technology and data analysis to reveal that the size and scope of China’s distant-water fleet has been hugely underreported.The ODI found the fleet had 16,966 vessels, five times more than previous estimates. By contrast, the US distant-water fleet comprises 300 boats.In 2017, as part of its 13th fisheries five-year plan, China announced plans to cap the size of the fleet to 3,000 vessels by 2020.“We were shocked by the results because we were expecting 4,000 or 5,000 vessels,” says Miren Gutiérrez, the lead author of the ODI report.The research, which took more than a year, also found nearly 1,000 of the boats were using “flags of convenience” and at least 183 vessels were involved in suspected IUU fishing, for which China ranked the worst-performing nation in a 2019 global index.A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers\u0027 Federation.Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.“Most of this overfishing is not illegal, that’s the problem,” Gutiérrez says, as most of it goes on in international waters. Most of the fleet’s vessels are trawlers – banned within China’s territorial waters and notorious for damaging  ecosystems by dragging nets along the seafloor. Other common boats are longliners, for larger fish such as tuna or shark, and squid-jiggers, which usually operate in deeper waters.China’s self-declared shake-up proposes changes to high-seas transshipment rules – the movement of cargo from one vessel to another – along with reforms to distant-water fishing. It also announced two three-month fishing moratoriums: one west of the Galápagos, between September and November, and another beginning in July in the south Atlantic near Argentina.The world’s biggest seafood exporter is also mooted to be planning to ratify the Port State Measures Agreement, the first internationally binding accord in which ports around the world pledge not to allow illegal or unregulated fishing boats to land catches.“It’s a significant concession,” says Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation. “But in the context of global fisheries it’s not enough, it’s not nearly enough.”Ecuador is one of a few small nation states that have pushed back against the Chinese flotillas. In the hotly disputed South China Sea, Indonesia sent F-16 fighter jets along with navy, coastguard and fishing boats to repel 63 Chinese fishing boats and four coastguard vessels from its waters in January.But North Korean fishing boats may have come off worse from exchanges with China’s “dark fleets”, amid reports of “ghost boats” washing up on Japanese shores containing the bodies of North Korean fishermen. In its backyard, the Chinese fleet has a fearsome reputation for systemic illegal fishing and aggressive tactics when faced with competitors or foreign patrol vessels.China signed a key UN fish stocks agreement in 1996 but never ratified it. It is a member of seven regional fishery management organisations, or RFMOs, but its distant water fleet operates outside of those frameworks, says Mercedes Rosello, director of House of Ocean, a not-for-profit legal consultancy that monitors IUU fishing.“When you are looking at thousands of vessels, the rules and mechanisms which that flag state adopts are of huge transcendence,” Rosello says.“The people who suffer first and worst are almost always the coastal communities who rely on those fisheries for their survival, wellbeing and food,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1dd4f6094c3b5c7bba4582b60eadbdf8a678dc/0_109_5222_3135/master/5222.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f25b838444a306b363fcdf4108f533e1","title":"the aliens to watch how the humble earthworm is altering the arctic aoe","story":"After hitching a ride with humans, the species has colonised entire areas and may be making the soil too fertile, say scientistsThey are a gardener’s best friend, good for the soil and a treat for birds. But the humble earthworm may not always be good news, according to a study that suggests invasive earthworms could be making Arctic soils too fertile.The earthworm is not typically thought of as an invasive species. “Most parts of Europe have earthworms so we never really saw them as a problem,” says lead researcher Dr Gesche Blume-Werry, an ecologist from the University of Greifswald in Germany. But Blume-Werry and her colleagues realised that “more and more spots in the Arctic have worms because humans brought them there”.Earthworms move at around five to 10 metres a year in the Arctic, but human mobility means they can jump from the UK to Svalbard in a single move. They are reaching remote areas by hitchhiking in the treads of people’s shoes, from being used as bait for fishing and in imported soils for gardening. As the Arctic warms, they are able to colonise more areas.Early research indicates that the earthworms could have the same effect on Arctic plant productivity as a 3C rise in temperature.Invasive plant and animal species are non-native organisms that disrupt the natural balance of ecosystems, often outcompeting native wildlife, which causes their own populations to explode. A minority of non-native species become invasive but common traits include rapid growth, fast reproduction and high resilience to new environments.\u0026nbspWhy are they a problem?Invasive species are among the largest threats to bioersity in the world because they can permanently alter the healthy functioning of an ecosystem and cause local extinctions, resulting in large-scale economic and environmental damage. Japanese knotweed damages building foundations and flood defences in the UK, costing hundreds millions of pounds to manage every year.\u0026nbspOther highly problematic invasive species include the European wild boar in the southern US, the North American grey squirrel in Europe and South American water hyacinth in waterways around the world.\u0026nbspHow do they spread?Human trade, tourism and the pet business have caused large-scale redistributions of plants and animals around the world, driving local extinctions of native organisms. A recent study in the journal Global Change Biology warned that, if left unchecked, the spread of non-native plant and animal species around the globe could lead to cataclysmic loss of bioersity.Typical Arctic temperatures are too cold for decomposers like fungi and bacteria to break down organic matter effectively, causing a lack of nutrients in the soil, which inhibits plant growth. Now, scientists are realising the absence of earthworms is also a key part of the story because they unlock nitrogen, an important component in plant growth.They do this by breaking down litter and humus, excreting it in their worm casts. Worms move nutrients down to where roots are, through networks of horizontal and vertical tunnels. Anecic worms (the most common in the UK) make vertical burrows and endogeic worms make horizontal burrows. Earthworms that just work on the surface (epigeic worms) don’t make tunnels and are not considered geoengineers.Taller, scrubby plants (which have grown better due to nitrogen-rich soils) are more likely to stick out of the snow during winter, and scientists believe this could mean more heat is absorbed, accelerating snow melt.In the northern boreal forests of Canada and the US, earthworms had been absent since at least the last ice age, 12,000 years ago. But as settlers from Europe colonised these lands, they brought earthworms with them in the ballasts of ships and on imported plants. Slowly, these invaders changed the forest ecosystem by converting leaf litter into humus. This altered the delicate relationship between fungi and plants, which changed the pH of the top layers of soil, leading to reduced overall bioersity, according to 2016 research published in Global Change Biology.In 2017, a team of scientists went digging for worms in the Arctic. Associate professor Jonatan Klaminder, an environmental scientist at Umeå University in Sweden, who was involved in the research, said he had assumed the climate would be too cold and harsh. He was wrong.Arctic soils around this area generally have 10cm of poorly decomposed organic material, but at the 19th century site in northern Sweden the organic layer on top of the soil and leaf litter had disappeared, just as it had in the northern boreal forests in the US. Most of the spots in which earthworms were found were near human settlements such as old farms, cabins, gardens or fishing sites, which reinforced the idea they were brought in by humans.Geoengineering earthworms have now established themselves in Arctic soils in North America, Greenland, Iceland, Fennoscandia, and Russia. In the paper scientists warned earthworms “may pose a potent threat to some of the most remote and protected Arctic environments in northern Europe”, and called for immediate action, as the worms are almost impossible to eradicate once they have colonised.Klaminder says the research is a canary in the coalmine. “During the past 10,000 years we have not had geoeningeering earthworms in the landscape. And suddenly if we introduce them this will change how the system functions, so that’s why we’re seeing a strong impact … If you have 10,000 introduction points then this could be a very rapid process.”In the latest experiment, Klaminder, Blume-Werry and colleagues wanted to find out what these earthworms do to plant growth. They put soil in containers, or mesocosms, that were 50 x 39 x 30 cm and filled them will heath and meadow vegetation. The containers were kept at Abisko Scientific Research Station, which is 200km north of the Arctic Circle.Around 45 worms were added to half of the mesocosms. To determine root growth scientists put a camera in the soil that took photos of the roots at regular intervals. The “greenness” of vegetation (a measure of photosynthesis and therefore plant productivity) in the different containers was also monitored to work out how much impact worms were having.The effects caused by geoengineering earthworms were “as strong, or even stronger, than other important environmental drivers in the Arctic”, such as temperature increase, grazing animals and fertilisation using deer faeces, researchers wrote in their paper on the experiment, published in Nature Communications.Earthworms increased plant nitrogen concentrations on average more than three times as much as a 3C increase in summer temperatures. They caused an increase in plant greenness that appeared similar to the increase caused by a 3C temperature rise. Blume-Werry said the researchers were “super surprised” by the scale of the impact.Polar and alpine ecologist Jesamine Bartlett from the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research says there are approximately 8,000 inidual dandelion plants that have been creating “enormous lawns”, she says. “What’s alarming is that a couple of years ago there weren’t that many. They’re visually very striking. Every year it changes slightly depending on how warm the summer is.” Earthworms are also probably a lot more widely distributed than we think, says Bartlett, but there are few specialists working in this area. “I don’t think we’re aware of it at all,” she says. “Some of the major activity in Svalbard has been going on for decades. It’s very likely this could have spread further and no one has done a basic survey of just running through the most populous towns and gone through it to see what is there.”Detritivores, including earthworms, are some of the most damaging invasive species you can get because if people don’t see them they don’t think they’re a problem. They change the foundations of ecosystems and set a precedent for other invasive species looking to move in. “They are the aliens to watch. Don’t be distracted by the big glossy, invasive plants. See what’s happening in your soil,” says Bartlett, who has set up a “stop Arctic aliens” website to raise awareness about the importance of making sure visitors do not accidentally bring in unwanted species.Research in this area is still in its infancy, says Marc Macias-Fauria, an ecologist from the University of Oxford who was not involved in these studies. The mecocosm research by Blume-Werry et al was creative, smart and timely, he says, given Arctic ice melt and increasing numbers of humans in the region. It would be interesting to see how growth varies in different Arctic environments, he adds. “The discussion is engaging and exciting but this is a first stage, there are many more questions in front of the paper than behind it”.In general, big Earth systems – ways of modelling the interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes of our planet – do not look at the impact of animals and vegetation on the land . Instead, models looking at vegetation are usually dictated by research on the climate. There is only one climate model – the Madingley model in Cambridge – that looks at the impact of animals. Macias-Fauria says encouraging more of these big models to incorporate the role of animals is “definitely very welcome”.Dr Bonnie G Waring, an ecologist at the Grantham Institute, who was not involved in the research, says it highlights how humans change natural ecosystems in myriad ways, not just by burning fossil fuels. “The Arctic is experiencing multiple perturbations that could lead to rapid and profound restructuring of high-latitude ecosystems, and we need to study these disturbances in a holistic way,” she says.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/befef7d394c8d6bb229f0df063691cf62ccac094/0_403_7846_4710/master/7846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=344ed994b8426b84024cd872403a1f78","title":"special branches the nominations to be englands tree of the year in pictures","story":"A sycamore laced with the shoes of jubilant students, a haunted oak bound in chains and a Hackney plane facing the chop are among the 10 contenders to become England’s tree of the year.

Sitting down is something I’m not good at doing for a long time.”Moments later he is off and running. At times over the next hour it feels hard to keep pace, the ideas pinging around in a manner familiar to anyone who can picture him eating up the yards during the peak of his football career. Flamini is on a mission. He wants athletes to seize their opportunity, in fractured and rudderless times, to disrupt the status quo and use their voices meaningfully. He would like them to channel their life experience and, when the subject matter is relevant, become activists. Essentially, he would like more of them to follow in the footsteps of Marcus Rashford.“I sent him a message telling him: ‘You’ve made us all very proud, you’ve been an inspiration,’” he says of his reaction to the government U-turn prompted by Rashford’s articulate, persistent and flawlessly reasoned argument that free school meal vouchers should be continued over the summer. “We all have to stand together so more and more athletes can understand they have a social responsibility, and can use their platform to drive positive change. We don’t accept being told to shut up any more.”Flamini is not merely sounding off. While Rashford can speak compellingly about the sacrifices his mother made during his childhood in Wythenshawe, the former Arsenal midfielder found much of his own world view shaped when growing up in southern France. His involvement as co-founder of GF Biochemicals, a dazzlingly successful entity that focuses on finding sustainable alternatives to oil-based products, is well known and bears no resemblance to tropes around footballers discovering sidelines in, say, real estate.“Growing up by the sea, I could see from a very early age the impact of plastics in the water, on the beach,” he says. “It’s horrendous and makes you realise that, if we don’t change something, the place where we live won’t be liveable any more. I was very aware of everything, very curious. I always told myself: ‘If I do something else later on outside football, I want it to be around sustainability.’“The opportunity came along, we started, and I was not very knowledgeable around everything when I began. But through the years I’ve become part of this world of passionate people who give their lives to put the planet, the environment, the sea, before even themselves. It’s very inspiring but what they are missing is a voice, a platform. So as a footballer I’ve always tried, after developing my knowledge, to create awareness and make a small impact myself.”What he calls his “journey around sustainability” began with GF Biochemicals’ birth in 2008, when he was 24. It happened during a year in which he enjoyed the best season of his life at Arsenal and earned a move to Milan. Even for a man who just kept on going – the sight of Flamini fuelling himself with colossal bowls of pasta at the London Colney training ground was a common one – there should not be enough hours in the day. But he says such weighty external interests affected his football positively, constituting “an escape, clearing my mind, refreshing myself to come back stronger”.During his second spell in north London teammates would look on in a mixture of amusement and genuine interest when, after training, he would change into a suit and drive off to a meeting. Héctor Bellerín, a kindred spirit, reminded him of that recently. “He told me: ‘I was thinking, wow, one day I also want to do something like that.’ We need more players like Héctor that are thinking outside the box, using their platform to create a positive impact. We speak too much about negative things. Let’s speak about beautiful things let’s speak about love, let’s unite people.”By now he must have completed several laps of the building – in France, though he is based in London – in which he is taking the call. The thoughts keep coming, though: Flamini is particularly interested in how elite footballers, blessed with access to some of the best doctors and nutritionists, can exert a direct influence in public health. At length, he expounds the benefits of cutting animal protein and dairy, while increasing one’s water intake, and how such decisions need not only benefit athletes. There is, he believes, an obvious place to begin informing wider society.“I was reading about the UK standing up to obesity, the NHS being under a lot of pressure and the government doing a campaign around it. Great, finally we are talking about it – so why don’t we involve athletes, footballers, in pushing these messages to educate younger generations? Football has a role to play here. Let’s bring players into schools to speak about how important it is to eat healthily, and let’s use social media. If we want to reach a large number of kids, that’s how we need to do it.”Flamini worries young people are “living in a system that is killing the dreams of their generation” and, more than once, points to a lack of trust in established institutions. The space between them is the one he thinks sportspeople, with their huge social media followings, can inhabit and use to bring back that faith in public figures.Although now a businessman enjoying considerable success, he still wants to be viewed as a footballer. The sport is, he stresses, the first thing he thinks about upon waking up. As recently as last year he was playing in La Liga for Getafe all that conditioning acumen has helped ensure that, at 36, he still feels more than physically capable. “Everything is possible,” is all he will offer on the topic of a comeback in the meantime he stays in constant touch with developments at Arsenal, expressing particular satisfaction at the managerial promise of his former teammate Mikel Arteta.“It was always clear he’d go in the direction of coaching,” he says. “Even back then, he’d mention it. I’m very happy the club has trusted an ex-player because for too many years that was missing at Arsenal: someone who feels, breathes and lives the club. I really hope he’ll be successful and that we’ll be one of the main contenders very soon.”Now he is taking a seat once more and the camera, switched off while he darted about, is back on. We are finishing up but it is clear that, for Flamini, this will only be a momentary pause. “These days people really value authenticity, honesty and transparency,” he says. “We have a great opportunity to help so many people in our communities. For me, a champion is someone who not only wins on the pitch, but takes the lead off it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b00d7e95fc2232754b66912bcc66f0ccfc1a73/0_194_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411bb852690862a86506dbbae8b3b8e5","title":"africa to be declared free of wild polio after decades of work","story":"Achievement comes following Nigeria vaccination drive, with last cases of wild virus recorded four years agoAfrica is expected to be declared free from wild polio, after decades of work by a coalition of international health bodies, national and local governments, community volunteers and survivors.Four years after the last recorded cases of wild polio in northern Nigeria, the Africa Regional Certification Commission (ARCC) is expected to certify that the continent is free of the virus, which can cause irreversible paralysis and in some cases death.The achievement is the result of a campaign to vaccinate and monitor children in Borno State, the final front of polio eradication efforts on the continent, and the heart of the jihadist insurgency in Nigeria.“It’s been a momentous, massive undertaking, with amazing persistence and perseverance, coming in the face of moments when we thought we were just about there, then we’d have a reversal,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) regional director for Africa, said.The WHO, she said, had played a central coordinating role within the Global Polio Eradication Initiative – a coalition of national governments and local leaders, working with Unicef, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – and with millions of community volunteers across the continent.Improved surveillance, tackling violent levels of vaccine scepticism that fuelled deadly attacks on health workers and the inclusion of polio survivors within eradication teams were key factors in wiping out the virus, said Moeti.“I would really like to pay tribute to polio survivors, who have joined in the fight, who have helped in sharing their experiences of disability with polio and the impact this has had on their lives,” she said.In 1996, 75,000 children in Africa were paralysed by polio.The fight now is to improve the lives of survivors, said Moeti.“This moment underlines the importance of paying attention and better prioritising the needs of people with disabilities in the African region. Health is not just the absence of a disease that can kill, it is a complete sense of wellbeing,” she said.Musbahu Lawan Didi, co-founder of Nigeria’s Association of Polio Survivors, campaigning for the rights of those with polio , said: “It is incredible that what we have started years ago has built these results. As polio survivors we are the happiest and believe we’ll be the last polio survivors in the country.”But he added: “Ninety percent of polio survivors in Nigeria live in poverty. Many of us are trawling the streets to survive, begging. It should not be so.”Dr Rose Leke, chair of the ARCC, an independent body set up by the WHO, said the declaration followed exhaustive assessments of surveillance systems in 47 African countries to ensure no cases were missedDespite the progress, however, 16 countries in the region are currently experiencing small outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio,which can occur among underimmunised communities.Efforts to eradicate wild polio globally were spurred by the formation of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988. Since then, cases of wild polio have fallen dramatically from an estimated 350,000 cases to 33 reported cases in 2018. In Africa, a campaign by leaders from the continent, led by Nelson Mandela, helped drive progress.But the insurgency in northern Nigeria made the disease hard to shift. In 2013, nine women who were vaccinating children in Kano were shot dead by gunmen suspected of belonging to Boko Haram.At least 67 frontline health workers involved in polio eradication efforts in the region have been killed, with others attacked and abducted. Several violent incidentswere spurred by a rejection of vaccinations by local communities, said Dr Tunji Funsho, head of Rotary International’s Nigeria polio committee.“A challenge was insidious rumours that the vaccine is not safe, that it could lead to HIV, Aids, could sterilise women with a view to reduce the population in the northern part of the country,” he said. Suspicion of western aligned medical initiatives, and of efforts to suppress Muslim majorities caught alight in the region.In July 2003, five states in northern Nigerian suspended the use of polio vaccinations for at least a year. Annual cases in Nigeria then soared, with Nigerian strains of the virus spreading across Africa.The bitter legacy of controversial medical trials for other diseases in northern Nigeria also fuelled opposition to vaccinations.But a big effort to appeal to political, community and religious leaders, along with public campaigns and town hall meetings began a gradual turnaround.In 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari was televised personally administering oral vaccine drops to one of his grandchildren.“The sad thing is that some rejections are not just because they don’t believe in the polio vaccine, but they have … needs that come first,” said Funsho. For example, polio vaccinations take precedence over healthcare for more fatal diseases like malaria.“So refusing vaccines becomes a kind of protest against the government,” he said, explaining that it was a way of impressing the need for greater investment in healthcare.He said in some cases, fathers refused vaccines for their children because they were too ashamed to reveal their children had not eaten and were fearful it would induce a reaction. “We’ve had to make sure we really understand and listen to people’s needs and concerns,” Funsho said.The increased involvement of polio survivors over the past decade was crucial to addressing the concerns from local communities, said Lawan Didi, who was diagnosed with polio when he was two. “People saw us, and communicated with us. We could explain to them this is not a spiritual thing, but can be prevented with vaccines. It gave them a change of heart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19ed0583483c6c03a5939f88a6d2ad4d622ec0fc/0_81_847_508/master/847.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=20f269bee1f7719c8e91e0847fa14bc0","title":"no safe level coffee drinking pregnant women study says","story":"Cut out caffeine to help avoid miscarriage, low birth weight and stillbirth, paper advisesPregnant women should cut out coffee completely to help avoid miscarriage, low birth weight and stillbirth, according to a study of international evidence about caffeine and pregnancy.In contradiction to official guidance in the UK, US and Europe, there is no safe level for caffeine consumption during pregnancy, according to a peer-reviewed study published in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.It analysed more than 1,200 studies of the drug’s effect on pregnancy and found “persuasive confirmation of increased risk … for at least five major negative pregnancy outcomes: miscarriage, stillbirth, lower birth weight andor small for gestational age, childhood acute leukaemia, and childhood overweight and obesity.”But the study was dismissed by the coffee industry, which urged consumers to stick to the public health advice in the UK, US and Europe that daily caffeine intake equivalent to two cups of medium-strength cups of coffee (200mg) is safe for pregnant women.A large majority of pregnant women consume caffeine, which is also found in energy drinks and at lower levels in cola, chocolate and tea. Britons drink an estimated 104m cups of coffee per day, up from 70m in 2008.The World Health Organization has acknowledged studies that suggest excess intake of caffeine may be associated with restricted growth, reduced birth weight, preterm birth or stillbirth. It recommends that pregnant women consuming more than 300mg per day should cut back.The new research by Prof Jack James, of Reykjavik University, found that “current advice … is not consistent with the level of threat indicated by biological plausibility of harm and extensive empirical evidence of actual harm.” It concluded that health recommendations needed “radical revision”.“The cumulative scientific evidence supports pregnant women and women contemplating pregnancy being advised to avoid caffeine,” the report said.James said eight out of every nine studies on caffeine and miscarriage reported “significant associations”. Some suggested consumption increased the risk by a third, and others said the risk increased with every extra cup of coffee.Four out of five observational studies on stillbirth – the loss of an unborn child after 20 weeks – reported increased risk related to caffeine, with the risk increasing by as much as five times in women consuming high doses. Seven out of 10 studies on low birth weight reported a link.The British Coffee Association, whose members include Costa and Caffè Nero, said James’s study did not establish cause and effect, and it urged pregnant women to stick to existing guidelines.“The current evidence given by the NHS is based on a comprehensive review of all the scientific evidence available on coffee and health, which shows that pregnant women should limit caffeine intake to 200mg per day or less, and at these levels does not increase the risk of reproductive complications,” said a spokesperson.“This new study is an observational study, so importantly does not show any direct cause-and-effect link and also is subject to confounding factors such as cigarette smoking and wider dietary issues, which may limit its ability to draw clear conclusions.”James said causation was likely because of the observed relationships between the amount of caffeine consumed during pregnancy and the risk of negative pregnancy outcomes.He said the research was notable for the “effort that has been invested in the search for and control of potential confounders”. Variables including body mass, age, pregnancy history, alcohol use and exposure to pollutants had all been considered.Two years ago the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England and Wales updated its advice to urge complete abstinence from alcohol during the first three months of pregnancy because it may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.The Food Standards Agency said: “Based on current scientific opinion, the FSA advises pregnant and breastfeeding women not to have more than 200mg of caffeine over the course of a day, which is roughly two mugs of instant coffee or one mug of filter coffee.”Public Health England has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c2cf1fb62cd04258061f9520dd1c1b72c650f0a/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d83a3093d2c281486e1e8e38926cd55","title":"david olusoga racism in tv has led to lost generation of black talent","story":"Lack of BAME people in executive and behind-camera roles down to being ignored or worn down by industry, says historianSystemic racism in British television has forced out a generation of black talent who quit because they were being ignored or worn down by their experiences, the industry’s leaders were told on Monday.In a devastating critique, the prominent broadcaster and historian David Olusoga said the impact of this “lost generation” could be seen in unrepresentative programmes that failed to reflect modern Britain.Delivering the keynote MacTaggart lecture at the virtual edition of the Edinburgh television festival, Olusoga said a recent incident where the BBC defended the decision to use the N-word on air had “genuinely damaged faith in the BBC among many black people” and would not have happened if there were more senior black staff in newsrooms.Olusoga, who spent the early part of his television career as a producer, said his own experience of the British television industry had left him feeling so “isolated and disempowered” that he was diagnosed with clinical depression.“I’ve come close to leaving this industry on several occasions. And I know many black and brown people who have similar stories to tell.”“They left because even when they got work, their voices were too often not listened to their stories too often were not of interest to the tastemakers and programme pickers who, over the same period, grew ever more powerful within the structure of TV. They’re not here now because we didn’t have the will to keep them and – worn out by it all – they gave up on our industry.”His comments come at an acutely sensitive time for the media as leaders grapple with the fallout from the Black Lives Matter movement. And they echo sustained criticism of the industry’s racism in recent years. Two years ago, Michaela Coel, the creator of I May Destroy You, used the MacTaggart lecture to describe her experience of racism and sexual assault, while in 2014 Sir Lenny Henry told an audience at Bafta that black British actors were having to go to the US to build their careers.Olusoga said that while television is becoming more erse on screen, progress at the top of the food chain has been slower. “There is willingness to accept black people as performers, in front of the camera, but unwillingness on the part of the industry to make space for them behind the scenes, in the rooms where the decisions are made and the real creativity happens,” he said.“When I became a presenter, I could not help but notice that that our industry was far more comfortable with me in that capacity than it ever has been with me as a producer.”He also said the media regulator Ofcom should require broadcasters to have racially erse staff rather than simply produce reports highlighting the issue – or be replaced by a regulator that is willing to take tough enforcement action.Olusoga, who runs his own television production company while serving as professor of public history at the University of Manchester, said the iniduals who commission television programmes are drastically unrepresentative of the audiences they served. As a result, black people in the industry are constantly having to deal with accusations that they are troublesome or awkward when they make points to those iniduals.“One colleague I worked with complained endlessly that I was especially difficult. I was difficult whenever I talked about the sensitivities of black history, or warned of the danger of racial tropes, or of unintentionally reinforcing racial stereotypes. I was, they told me, too political, too sensitive, too difficult.“But my colleague had a solution. What I needed to do, I was told, was to be more like another black person they knew. This other black guy was far more relaxed, less caught up in all of this history stuff, he didn’t feel the need to discuss race, racism, stereotypes and all the other annoying stuff. If only I could be more like him, because then we would all just ‘get along’. This ideal black guy was someone my colleague would hang out with. He’d come round their house and listen to music – in perfect racial harmony.“As this piece of advice went on, and I learned more details about this ideal black person, I began to wonder if perhaps the reason they were so unthreatening, so relaxed and so laid back might have been because the black person I was being urged to emulate was my colleague’s cannabis dealer.”He highlighted the case of Marvin Rees, who was a BBC journalist in Bristol before quitting the corporation and later becoming the city’s directly elected mayor. “When I asked Marvin Rees why he had finally given up and left the industry, this is what he said: ‘The truth is, the BBC just wore me down with hopelessness.’”“If, however, in another alternative existence, Marvin might have been there, or on the end of the phone, as a senior colleague, to give advice, that incident, that has genuinely damaged faith in the BBC among many black people, might have been avoided.”Many of the major announcements at the television festival concerned ersity and the elevation of black voices. The BBC’s director of content, Charlotte Moore, said the television industry would “not survive” if it did not embrace ersity and highlighted the forthcoming five-part series Small Axe by director Steve McQueen.Earlier in the day, former BBC journalist Marcus Ryder asked panellists at the television festival whether questions of media ersity were too fixated on traditional channels: “Are we focusing on too much on BBC and Channel 4 and not enough on platforms like Netflix? Are we being too old-fashioned about this?”Duane Jones, who runs his own production company, said the new streaming companies had an advantage over many established outlets: “I feel like the less traditional platforms are more open-minded when it comes to working with erse talent and company founders like myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f37e51f606ebe7dc66de075ab470ff414822fb/0_137_3579_2148/master/3579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8fac7795af3e501f936f5f0b609a65","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

A BBC Panorama programme broadcast a similar charge on Monday night.Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been under effective house arrest in Tehran since March when she was given temporary release from prison having served four years of a five-year sentence for alleged espionage. She was arrested in Tehran in April 2016.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has alleged that her full release has been held back by the UK’s failure to settle an acknowledged £400m debt over an arms deal with the late shah of Iran.In the letter to Wallace, the lawyers say it is astonishing that International Military Services (IMS), a UK government agency, “continues to raise every possible legal objection to payment of the debt and has plainly failed to engage in constructive dialogue with Tehran”.The letter claims the Foreign Office evades and prevaricates when it is asked the simplest questions on the steps it may be taking to pay the debt, which has been the subject of more than a decade of court disputes.It says a decision to defer the next high court hearing on the debt until 4 November, a day after the US presidential election “in effect plays politics with the lives of British citizens”.The lawyers claim: “The UK government is apparently waiting for implicit permission from the US government to pay the UK’s legally owed debts, payment of which would allow Nazanin (and other innocent British nationals) finally to come home. The message appears to be that the safety of British citizens abroad is subordinate to falling in line with US policy.”The UK stance is somewhat paradoxical, the letter says, in that the US has itself negotiated two prisoner swaps with Iran recently.It also claims British tactics have failed to deter the Tehran regime, saying: “There has been a new wave of forced confessions and prisoners being tortured, a new programme of family members of activists and prisoners being arrested, more instances of second sentences being levelled against cellmates of Nazanin who would otherwise be eligible for release.”Part of the purpose of the letter is to warn the UK government that its actions risk endangering the freedom of more British dual nationals.The letter concludes: “It is important that the UK both honours its legally owed obligations to Iran, but also calls out the Iranian government on its illegal treatment of Nazanin under Iranian law. However, the UK government has done precisely the opposite: obtusely refusing to discharge its legal obligations, whilst remaining silent and appeasing Iran in the face of Tehran’s atrocious abuse of Nazanin’s human rights.”The Ministry of Defence said: “The defence secretary’s position on this matter has not changed. As previous government statements have made clear, we remain committed to securing the immediate and permanent release of all arbitrarily detained dual British nationals in Iran and regularly lobby for their release at the highest levels. This includes through the prime minister, the foreign secretary and the British ambassador in Tehran.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b36d3731257e0f417acc0569f01cb7e35760224/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8a051233fe237a5bb2cb464db0bb0f4","title":"headteachers launch stinging criticism of education secretary","story":"England’s school leaders accuse government of failing to listen during coronavirus crisisThousands of headteachers have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accusing the government of repeatedly failing to listen or collaborate as schools prepare to reopen to millions of children across England.In what appears to be a damaging breakdown in relations, headteachers say they are facing some of the most significant challenges of their professional lives but feel they are “working in isolation”, unsupported by the government.School leaders, who are still picking up the pieces after the recent exams fiasco, say their confidence in government has been “significantly knocked”. They are calling for urgent changes to current ways of working to help ensure a safe return to school.The intervention by the Worth Less? lobbying group, which represents thousands of headteachers across 75 local authorities from Cumbria to Cornwall, came as Boris Johnson said it was a “moral duty” to get children back into education after five months of absence.The prime minister, who was criticised for keeping a low profile as the A-levels fiasco unfolded, insisted that the risk of contracting coronavirus in school was low and that it was damaging for children to stay out of education for any longer.The success of the prime minister’s campaign will, however, depend on headteachers, who say they are not listened to and are not trusted by the government. Instead of meaningful collaboration, the letter says school leaders are at the mercy of ever shifting policy directives and “myriad changes”.“In a time of unprecedented challenge, we need some clarity and purpose,” said Jules White, head of Tanbridge House school in Horsham, West Sussex, and the leader of Worth Less?, which cut its campaigning teeth on school funding and organised a headteachers’ march on Downing Street to press for more money.School leaders who signed up to the letter described recent events as “farcical” and variously expressed anger, frustration and anxiety about how the government has handled the response to Covid on schools and plans for reopening in September.Their letter is also disparaging about assumptions that, once opened, schools will be able to carry on as before. “The pandemic has already created far-reaching problems for many children,” the letter states. “The notion that schools will find a ‘new normal’ that allows provision to simply carry on as before is unhelpful in the extreme. New priorities have emerged and they will need to be tackled quickly and effectively.”As the clock ticks down to the start of the academic year, the letter lists a series of headteachers’ pressing concerns, including fears about whether there will be sufficient resources to support children’s mental health.Worth Less? is also concerned about unrealistic expectations for next year’s exams. The government and Ofqual have made a number of modest changes to GCSEs and A-levels due to be taken in 2021, but teachers say they do not go nearly far enough and would like a radical rethink.Headteachers have also expressed fears about the lack of contingency planning for short-term school closures and local lockdowns in response to infection outbreaks. Downing Street admitted on Monday that schools could be forced to close again if stricter local lockdown measures are needed to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and teachers must prepare remote learning for pupils.“The complexity of the challenges that lie ahead must not … be underestimated,” the letter states, “and if children and their families are to be most effectively served, urgent improvements to current ways of working are required.“As headteachers face some of the most important challenges of our professional lives, all too often we feel that we are working in isolation from government rather than in harmony with our political masters.“Collaboration, consultation and partnership have felt in short supply and this caused immense frustration as time, energy and resources have been wasted by headteachers as we respond to shifting policy directives and myriad changes.”Pupils in England and Wales are due to return to schools from next week, following Northern Ireland, where children began the new term on Monday, and Scotland, where pupils have been back at school for a fortnight. In one Dundee special school, 17 teachers and two pupils tested positive for Covid.The DfE has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/323d83bdaf4da333abeac29d9d31f2193d4bb933/0_389_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6491dbf453dabb716f3c948bd80db786","title":"eight in 10 poorer uk families feel worse off since lockdown survey","story":"Families tell of abandoning balanced meals and selling possessions for lack of moneySome families have abandoned balanced meals for lack of money during the coronavirus crisis, while many have faced physical and mental problems, according to a report.The findings underline the disproportionate strain being placed on the poorest households as the UK struggles to deal with the pandemic. In June the Resolution Foundation said that while many low-income families were turning to credit cards to get by under lockdown, many higher-income households were able to save more money as their costs fell.The CPAG and C of E researchers found that costs had gone up for many low-income families, many of whom were having to spend more on food and utilities than before. Meanwhile, many had lost work either as a direct result of the lockdown or the loss of support such as childcare.“We have had to cut down quite a bit, not have the diet we had before when I was trying to make sure that they get a balanced diet. I just manage whatever I can make, really … with fruit and everything being so expensive, you just have to get what’s affordable,” said one parent, named by the researchers as Ann-Marie.Another, named Claire, said: “I went round Lidl with a list and a calculator to try and get everything I possibly could at the lowest possible price. It has just meant worry and stress and anxiety, because as long as you can see a light at the end of the tunnel, it gives you strength to move forwards. We haven’t had that. In terms of financial impact, it’s meant absolutely counting every penny.”The CPAG said it found many children who were eligible for free school meals in England had not been receiving them. It called on the government to extend the scheme to all families in receipt of universal credit or working tax credit, with a view to bringing in universal free school meals for all children in the long term.The charity also said ministers should “increase child benefit by £10 a week and add an extra £10 a week to the child element within universal credit and child tax credits” and “abolish the benefit cap, or at least suspend it for the duration of the pandemic”.The researchers conducted an online survey of 264 low-income families from a range of backgrounds in the UK, and held in-depth interviews with 21 of the families in England, between May and July this year.

Anderson, sitting on 599 career wickets, will not want to wait to become the first seam bowler to pass the milestone.Of greater importance to England’s head coach, however, is completing a 2-0 series win and, after declaring his satisfaction at a day during which just two wickets fell – as the ball went soft, the pitch fell docile and Pakistan’s batsmen dug in – the call was for one final push.Silverwood said: “I’m very proud of how the players have handled themselves, being locked up for the best part of 10 weeks in the bubble. Their attitude and effort during that time has been fantastic.“To finish strong and see Jimmy get his 600th would be fantastic. He’s an inspiration, isn’t he? To have one of the best in the world sat in your dressing room, playing for your country is absolutely amazing. He’s constantly helping the other bowlers and it would be brilliant to see him get over the line.“But I want to win the game – that’s my first and foremost. Weather permitting, let’s give it a good go.”Silverwood insisted the 56 overs of toil on a rain-affected fourth day were “good practice” for overseas assignments when the ball does not move off the straight and he was pleased to see Jofra Archer strive for the speeds asked of him before the match even though the 25-year-old remains wicketless thus far.“I think we’ve seen pace from him this time,” the former Yorkshire and England bowler said. “We talked through his role and we’ve seen what we asked him to do: 90mph and good skill. We all know there is a world-class bowler there.”Ollie Pope, meanwhile, will not take the field on the final day of England’s Test summer and is due to undergo a scan after sustaining an injury to his left shoulder as he slid to prevent a boundary just two overs into the fourth morning.The 22-year-old Surrey batsman, who appeared in considerable discomfort following the tumble and did not reappear, dislocated the same shoulder while playing for his county last summer – a problem that required surgery and led to him missing three months of cricket."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86d58999b1ac33491ccd3bb3b115c4337cee3e5/0_215_5302_3183/master/5302.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5102395f79dd0ab75ae665155f81fdc8","title":"samsung galaxy buds live review novel bean shaped airpod rivals sound battery","story":"Good sound and long battery life with a repairable and unusual open-fit design make great alternative earbudsSamsung’s latest Galaxy Buds Live true wireless earbuds are different from anything else on the market. They are shaped like kidney beans that you put in your ear – which is precisely why they are good.The Galaxy Buds Live cost £179, have active noise cancellation (ANC) and sit above the excellent £159 Galaxy Buds+ as Samsung’s top Bluetooth earbuds.What makes the Buds Live different is the way they fit. Shaped like a bean, they don’t have a traditional silicone ear tip, nor a stalk.Instead, the whole thing fits in the concha of your ear – the hollow between the ear canal and the cartilage at the back of your ear.They have an open-type fit that doesn’t block your ear canal with anything instead, they just line up the speaker grille so that sound is projected down your earhole.A small silicone wing, of which there are two sizes in the box, wedges up against the inside of your ear on the back side of the earbud to keep it in place.They look very strange but are quite comfortable once inserted and do not protrude far from your ear. Although how you get on with them will be dictated by your ear shape. For those that prefer the isolation of a silicone earbud tip, these are not for you.The earbuds are small – and so is the charging case. It is more of a square pillow shape than the one that comes with the Buds+, but is just as easily pocketable, fitting in the money pocket of a pair of jeans.The connectivity and controls are the same as the Buds+. They support Bluetooth 5 with both the universal SBC and AAC audio standards, and Samsung’s proprietary scalable audio codec, which only works with Samsung devices.The Buds Live are compatible with all standard Bluetooth devices, including Android, iPhones, iPads, Macs and Windows 10 devices. Connectivity to a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, OnePlus 8 Pro, iPad Pro, iPhone 11 Pro and Surface Pro 7 was excellent.The Galaxy Wearable app on Android handles settings and updates on Android. The Galaxy Buds app on the iPhone does the same.Pairing is as simple as either opening the case for the first time or pressing and holding both earbuds for three seconds for each subsequent pairing. On Samsung and Windows you will see a quick-pairing popup that you only have to tap. On iOS you will have to do a manual pairing in settings.Samsung devices will sync the earbud’s pairing information between them, so they will be instantly available to other Samsung devices. They only connect to one device at a time but you can seamlessly switch between devices without having to manually disconnect each one.The Buds Live feature similar tap controls to Samsung’s other earbuds. Single tap for pauseplay, twice and thrice for skip track forwards or back. The tap and hold gesture can be changed but by default it turns ANC on or off – I preferred to have it as volume control.The Buds Live will outlast most competitors between charges, managing at least eight hours of playback between trips in the case without using noise cancelling. The case can charge the earbuds 2.5 times, adding up to 28 hours of total playback time.Turning on noise cancelling reduces the playback time by approximately two hours (up to 21 hours with the case). Talk time is up to 5.5 hours.A five-minute trip in the case gives the earbuds enough power to produce up to an hour of playback. Charging the case is done via the USB-C port or wireless charging.Samsung does not sell inidual replacement buds or cases. Unlike most true wireless earbuds, however, the batteries in the Galaxy Buds Live and case can be replaced by authorised service centres.Similar to Samsung’s other true wireless earbuds, the Galaxy Buds Live are some of the most repairable earbuds available, scoring an impressive eight out of 10 by repair specialists iFixit, which makes them far less disposable than competitors. In addition, the earbuds and case are made from post-consumer recycled plastic. The combination of those two things makes them some of the most environmentally friendly earbuds you can buy.The Buds Live sound really good for open-type earbuds better than Apple’s AirPods and Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds.They sound similar to Samsung’s excellent Buds+, with a surprising amount of bass and richness from an open-fit earbud. They handle detail well, with good separation of tones, crisp highs, warm mids and punchy bass.They lack a smidgen of really deep bass, sound a little muted in some more raw pieces, such as Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit, and struggled with super-detailed tracks such as Baba O’Riley by the Who. But feed them live guitars, pumping electronica or hip-hop and you will be richly rewarded. They sound particularly good with Britpop, too.The Buds Live are a great-sounding set of everyday listening earbuds, particularly for the open-fit design.But one thing they don’t do is block out any background noise, as there is no silicone tip to isolate your ear canal. The noise cancelling is also not very effective.The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live cost £179, are available in bronze, black or white and ship on 20 August.For comparison, the Galaxy Buds+ cost £159, Apple AirPods cost £159, the AirPods Pro cost £249, Google’s Pixel Buds cost £179, Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds cost £199.99, the Jabra Elite 75t cost £169.99, the Libratone Track Air+ cost £167, the Sony WF-1000XM3 cost £169, and the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless cost £280.The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are a pair of attractive bean-shaped true wireless earbuds with good sound and a unique fit.If you don’t like silicone ear tips that block your ear canal, these earbuds are for you. They are light, secure and don’t protrude or have stalks.They sound better than open-fit rivals such as the AirPods but their active noise cancelling is only effective for deep rumbles. They last a long time between charges, have a good, compact and pocketable case, and work with Android, iOS, Windows and others.The Galaxy Buds Live are made from recycled plastic, the batteries are replaceable and the earbuds are generally repairable, which makes them far less disposable than rivals. Samsung should be commended for showing that it is possible to produce small, good earbuds that can actually be repaired.They won’t be for everyone but the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are a unique set of Bluetooth earbuds worth paying attention to.Pros: open fit, good battery life, great case, good sound, good controls, ANC, AAC support, seamless device switching, made of recycled plastic, can be repaired, batteries can be replacedCons: no noise isolation, ANC is limited, fit may not suit everyone, no water resistance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60901d10061e7c75e0f6b090449312dcc1913d7e/0_54_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa6ff348dda3fe2e3c9a07c46b57932","title":"how much do you know about hybrid cars take our quiz","story":"From better batteries to regenerative braking, test your knowledge on these low-emission vehiclesHonda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole.

Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop.

If you’re one of the thousands who have saddled up for the first time during or post-lockdown, fear not – this isn’t your average commuting kit.I’m on my way to catch a train to Lyme Regis, the starting point of a coast-to-coast bikepacking trip (basically, cycling and carrying your camping kit) via four of England’s oldest trails. Known collectively as the Greater Ridgeway, the 362-mile mixed-terrain route has neolithic roots and is a favourite with hikers. Departing from Dorset’s dramatic Jurassic Coast, it meanders along the Wessex Ridgeway, the Ridgeway, the Icknield Way and Peddars Way to Holme-next-the-Sea in Norfolk. OS Maps suggest there’s a corresponding cycle route, with bike-friendly ersions along the way, making it a (seemingly) ideal route for a bikepacking expedition.Although not a new phenomenon, bikepacking is a growing trend. Panniers and racks are out the preferred option is now specialist luggage attached to the bike by Velcro and straps in a streamlined set up. “We’ve seen an increase in sales and new customers,” says George Huxford of bag maker Apidura, confirming that, as with the rest of the cycling industry, Covid has had a positive impact on business.While a hedge and a waterproof bivvy bag are the preferred choice of sleeping quarters for hardcore enthusiasts, most bikepackers opt for a bothy or official campsite. This makes bikepacking bang on trend, combining camping with a more enjoyable method of arriving at your pitch than sitting in a car or taking public transport. Cycling UK is a valuable resource, starting with advice on how to plan a simple weekend ride and camp miles from your doorstep.What I’m attempting is certainly on the more extreme side (minus the hedges). An experienced cyclist with a number of 100-mile sportives under my belt, I’m looking to cover the Greater Ridgeway in four days – those looking for a more leisurely ride could choose a shorter section over more time. Four hours in, though, I’m questioning the plans I’d made from the comfort of my front room.Boulder-packed descents, loose gravel climbs and impassable sections of path that look like they haven’t been walked on, let alone ridden, since the stone age mean it’s slow going over Dorset’s undulating countryside. When I find myself 42 miles short of my campsite in Sixpenny Handley with only three hours of daylight left, I need to find a more direct route. Unlike the druids before me, I have the benefit of switching to smooth asphalt roads.I arrive at Church Farm Caravan and Camping Park (pitches from £11.50) as the sun is setting, the tougher travails of the day softened by my catching a glimpse of the Cerne Giant while descending into the village of Cerne Abbas. Hastily assembling my tarp – a sheet that provides the shelter of a tent for a fraction of the weight – in the light of a friendly neighbour’s car headlights, I conclude that I need a plan B. My routes will have to change, allowing me to reach my remaining campsites in daylight, see some more sights and average 90 miles a day. I will cut out some of the winding, time-consuming tracks and trails in favour of the streets of Newbury, Cambridge and Thetford.New routes plotted, I find the riding improves immediately. I have time for a leisurely pit stop at The Bridge Inn, Upper Woodford, north of Salisbury, for coffee and a thick slice of carrot cake, and continue across the Salisbury Plain military training ground (there are various routes, but the clearly marked danger zones should, obviously, be avoided). The views across the hills are breathtaking and I even spy muntjac, hares and pheasants.This was the bikepacking experience I’d hoped for: Wilton Windmill appearing on the hillside from a quiet country lane waving to barges on the canalside paths of the Kennet and tackling the Ridgeway’s woodland trails with hearty helpings of calories every few hours. Reaching White Mark Farm campsite in Watlington (pitches from £8) ahead of schedule, I down a well-earned pint and devour a pizza in the Spire \u0026amp Spoke’s sunny beer garden before I tend to my tarp, queue for my socially distanced shower and bed down for the night as red kites circle above.A 5.30am wakeup call courtesy of that distinctive screech doesn’t dampen my spirits, and I’m soon back in the saddle – a 110-mile epic standing between me and the Kings Forest Caravan Park (adults only, pitches from £15) on the NorfolkSuffolk border. It starts with a rollercoaster ride past Chequers, and by lunchtime I’m grateful to have swapped the punchy peaks of the Chilterns for the pan-flat Fens. The addition of luggage makes the climbs rather harder (an off-piste ascent on Aldbury Common sticks in the mind), but the trick is to embrace bikepacking’s slower nature. The environment then takes on a new vividness, making for a much more rewarding experience.I rise with the sun, the scent of the pine forests lingering while I pack up for the last time. There’s just 50 miles to go and the waves of Norfolk’s coast are pulling me towards the end – even a ford, ripe for a spot of wild swimming in Castle Acre, can’t break their magnetic spell. I grin when I spy the Wash and don’t stop smiling until I reach the sandy beach of Holme-next-the-Sea.After a train ride from King’s Lynn, I’m back grinding through traffic on London’s streets. While my expedition may have got off to a choppy start, I’ve been bitten by the bikepacking bug. I’m plotting my next escape from the city before I even reach my front door.• Charlie Allenby is the author of Bike London (Spring 2021, ACC Art Books).

The World of Wine (Wow), which opened on 31 July, celebrates the millennia-old love affair with oenology, while signalling Portugal’s confidence as a wine-making nation of note. Wedged like a multi-tiered wedding cake up the sloping southern bank of the River Douro, the city’s new “cultural district” announces itself with aplomb. With six museum spaces of immersive exhibits (the Wine Experience even has mock alleyways with fake sky), big-screen videos and interactive kids’ games, the project aims toeducate and entertain. There are also restaurants, cafes, bars, and numerous shops.Wow is spearheaded by the Fladgate Partnership, one of half a dozen or so wineries that dominate the country’s wine industry. Behind the big brands, however, the world of Portuguese wine remains erse and highly localised. How to get a real-life taster? Step off the tourist trail. Here’s our pick of the best ways to explore wine regions across the country. Unless you’re abstemious, it’s not ideal to be the designated driveron a vineyard tour. Far better to swap four wheels for two and discover Portugal’s wine country by bike. Crisscrossed with a network of well-established cycle paths, the Amarante region, home of Portugal’s signature vinho verde, is a great place to start. One of the best runs is along an old railway line through the grape-strewn Tâmega valley, north-east of Porto, starting in the pretty village of Arco de Baúlhe and finishing in the cobble-paved town of Amarante. Local tour agency Amarantrilhos arranges a one-day excursion along the route, with a transfer from Amarante (€48, max 6 people) and bike hire (€16). For a halfway treat of lunch and a wine-tasting (€35), book a spot (via A2Z tour agency) at the picturesque Quintas das Escomoeiras estate. Owner Fernando Fernandes offers an on-request explanation of the wine-making process (€25). A2Z also organises extended hiking trips in the area. • amarantrilhos.ptFor British wine-drinkers of a certain age, the word “Mateus” evokes nostalgia for flared trousers, bubble perms and cheese fondue. Sitting in 1970s drinks cupboards alongside the wonders that were Blue Nun, Liebfraumilch and Babycham, Mateus Rosé brought pizzazz to many a suburban drinks party. It’s as fondly remembered for its flask-shaped bottle and the label featuring a magnificent stately home as its frizzante contents. Welcome to Casa de Mateus near Vila Real, east of Porto, which, despite boasting its own ancient winery, bears no direct relation to Portugal’s famous pink export. Even so, as a prime example of Portuguese baroque architecture, it is worth a visit. Dating to the early 18th century, this one-time home of the counts of Mateus contains fascinating exhibitions and original decor, as well as fabulous gardens. A wine tasting is available on request (€10-€20). • €13 (children, €6.50), casademateusPortugal may boast fine grapes and wine-makers, but arguably its greatest contribution to the world of wine is the cork oak tree. The country is still home to one third of global cork production, the epicentre of which is the savannah-like province of Alentejo. To see these ancient gnarly cork oaks close up, the cork and wine producer Herdade da Maroteira offers a leisurely hiking tour of its 540-hectare farm near the historic city of Évora. In the company of local expert José, the walks include a stop-off at a megalithic tomb and a hilltop picnic (with goodies such as Altentejano cheese, Iberian black pork and Maroteira wine). For the less mobile, a 4x4 can be taken. Agro-ecological tour specialist Portugal Farm Experiences organises a similar half-day cork tour, also near Évora (from €39). • From €55 with lunch,corktrekkingOf the 1,115 miles of Portugal’s Atlantic coast, the Setúbal peninsula is one of the wildest and most beautiful, with miles of beaches, sandy-orange cliffs, beach bars and grass-tufted dunes. Ninety minutes south of Lisbon, the tiny seaside village of Melides is as chilled as a crisp vinho branco. Explore the beaches (or surrounding mountains) on lusitano horses before a post-ride tasting at the beach-side stables of the smooth, exuberant wines for which the region is famed. • Horse riding + wine tasting from €65 picnic (€30) or private lunch (€35-€50) also available, children welcome, passeiosacavalomelidesThe life of the farmhand is in no way glamorous, but, with the sun on your back and the whiff of sea air in your nostrils, it isn’t without upsides. Other plus points include the chance to work alongside locals, learn about wine-making first hand and practise your Portuguese (vinhedo – vineyard uva – grape estou exausto – I’m done in). Long-standing organic wine producer Monte da Casteleja provides board and lodging to anyone willing to lend a hand through the WWOOF volunteering network. Working alongside owner Guillaume and chief wine-maker Rui and their small team, it’s a half-day onhalf-day off arrangement. Tasks range from weeding and pruning through to bottling and harvesting. Inland from Lagos, the beach is five minutes away. • WWOOF membership €20, wwoof.ptIn central and south Portugal particularly, the sight of grapes on the vine usually means there are olives on the branch close by. Both fruits thrive in the region’s warm, dry conditions, though olives tend to mature shortly after the grape harvests (in autumn and late summer, respectively), thus fitting neatly into farmers’ diaries. In the Museu do Azeita (Olive Oil Museum) near Oliveira de Hospital, visitors are treated to a celebration of all things olive-esque. In a modern building shaped like an olive tree branch, the museum’s ground floor has a collection of artefacts illustrating olive oil’s history and heritage. Upstairs is a panoramic restaurant with a menu of olive- and olive-oil-inspired dishes and views over the Serra da Estrela mountain range. The brainchild of veteran olive-oil maker António Dias, the museum also has a store that sells the oils, including Dias’s brands, and wines from across the Beira region.• Admission €5, museudoazeiteHome to the Touriga Nacional vine (the primary component of port wine), Dão’s temperate climate and mountainous terrain makes for highly tannic, full-bodied wines. A new wave of wine-makers is changing things with fruitier, fresher, more sophisticated offerings. Most of these are independent, small-scale affairs, so the best way to check them out is by visiting one of the region’s regular wine fairs. Two of the best take place in the cities of Nelas and Viseu in September (suspended this year due to Covid-19). The Roman town of Viseu also holds an annual combined book-and-wine festival. Now in its sixth year, previous speakers at the three-day Tinto no Branco event have included Jonathan Coe, Michael Palin and Joanne Harris. • 6-8 December 2020, tintonobranco.ptBarely a century after the formation of Portugal in the 12th century, the first cork was wedged into a bottle of Taboadella wine, back in 1255. To prove its heritage, the 40-hectare vineyard in Satão has an ancient grape press set in a monolithic rock. That said, new owners (the Amorims, a four-generation family of wine-makers) have recently given the site a makeover, bringing the latest kit and viniculture know-how to the venture. On a plateau in the Dão region, Taboadella’s doors are open for a range of tours (from €12), tastings (from €12), sit-down meals (from €35) and even a “winemaker for the day” option (€85). This short course includes insights from Taboadella’s master wine-makers on the art of blending, as well as batch testing, corking and bottle labelling. • taboadella"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59581d68e98c5de8c83110dcf85d606dd279f3e7/0_0_4322_2593/master/4322.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72bd46aeab17801df6ce9481f41677e8","title":"i was definitely a bit of a tool louis theroux on 25 years of documentary making","story":"As he revisits his career in a new four-part series, TV’s top documentarian looks back at his evolution from accosting cult members to making films on eating disorders and dementiaIt is a strange feeling looking back at a much earlier version of yourself on television, a queasy mixture of recognition and distance, approval and shame, and above all an inescapable question: who is this plonker? Bespectacled, gawky, socially awkward and only 23 years old, I had been a surprising choice as a correspondent on Michael Moore’s TV Nation, a US network show where I stumbled around the wilds of America meeting extremists of various stripes: klansmen, cult members, sexual adventurers.Later, based on these segments, I landed my own TV series, Louis Theroux’s Weird Weekends. For some reason the BBC had insisted on putting my name in the title. Watching some of my early efforts again recently, with the distance of two decades, I couldn’t help passing judgment on the journalistic competence on display – whether I was asking the right questions of the porn performers and the apocalypse preppers. Sometimes I caught myself enjoying the raw, unvarnished reality and marvelling at how much we had managed to capture on tape. From time to time I saw the younger me as overly pushy and badgering, or in danger of being borderline rude. But I could see that was mostly from my awkwardness at being hired for a job I didn’t fully understand, and my worries about letting people down. Mainly I was distracted by my appearance, voice and how I came across. The way my hair is piled on top of my head. The faint mid-Atlantic twang in my accent.I was definitely a little bit of a tool, but what was harder to know was whether that was an obstacle or part of my gift.I was watching my old shows back recently not for simple nostalgia – though that would have been a good enough reason given how much has changed – but because I was faced with the more practical question of how to continue doing my job under lockdown. When the world shut down in March, a series of programmes I was working on was suddenly no longer feasible due to travel restrictions. I had a team ready to work but no projects. I made a podcast, Grounded With Louis Theroux. But I am a TV maker. What documentaries were possible that didn’t involve me leaving the house?Quite quickly, the idea of a retrospective show came up. The TV equivalent of a greatest hits album. Take the best bits from old programmes and link them together somehow using voiceover or maybe an interview with a director. The grammar could be figured out at a later stage. It was something we had thought about doing for a while – 2019 marked 25 years since I had started my career in television – but we never got round to it. But that was the pre-Covid thinking. In a world re-made by a virus, one of the many things that has changed is the appetite for archive-based television. Would we make four instead of one, the channel asked. Wow. OK. And like that, we went to work on an ambitious career retrospective with the title – dreamed up by me, and only partly because I secretly hoped it evoked subliminal thoughts of David Attenborough – Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge.Boiling down more than 50 hours of TV – not to mention the hundreds, maybe even thousands of hours of raw footage – turned out to be about as hard as you might expect. For a while I imagined it might be some kind of self-deconstruction of our processes. “An Adam Curtis kind of thing,” we airily said. “Show the bits you never see. The producer in shot. Programmes we never made.” This idea quickly evaporated in the heat of having to make a documentary that featured material viewers might actually want to see and that made some kind of sense. Instead we chose four themes that might impose an order on the material: belief, family, crime and the dark side of pleasure.These themes, while they were come by in a spirit of pragmatism, ended up giving us a coherence and cumulative logic that ended up being one of the greatest and most pleasurable discoveries of the whole process. Without realising it or intending it, it turns out the films I’ve been involved in making have captured a portrait of a changing culture, an oblique cultural history seen through the eyes of the people I have documented. This is true in obvious ways: given that I’ve made several films in jails and prison, and several others that involved immersion in police forces in major cities, it shouldn’t be surprising to look back and see the pre-history to the killing of George Floyd and the reaction to it, and the myriad ways in which they were both predicted and prefigured. What was more surprising was the way in which some of my older programmes contextualised and maybe explained the Trump phenomenon. The first episode of the series, about belief, features an Idaho-based second-amendment diehard with a penchant for apocalyptic conspiracy theories an elderly man with weird hair who’s in touch with UFOs a neo-Nazi family and a Vegas-based self-advertised multimillionaire and get-rich-quick guru. Having watched all these unlikely characters for 55 minutes, somehow when Donald Trump pops up at the end of the programme it is with an almost eerie feeling of inevitability.I also wanted to update stories by looking at what happened next – to the worlds they showed and the people involved in them. To an almost morbid extent, I circle around stories after completing them – I find it hard to let go and move on. Sometimes I stay in email contact with old subjects, or my team check in with them. Making Life on the Edge meant I had a reason to share the surprising developments in stories I had been tracking for years and also to reach out to other contributors I had long been curious to catch up with. Megan Phelps-Roper – who left the hate-spewing Westboro Baptist Church, founded by her grandfather Fred Phelps – has become a friend. She has published a book about her experiences and does talks on how to build bridges and communicate with people on the extremes (or simply people who disagree with you) in a way that they will hear. I spoke to her during the lockdown and we included a small portion of the conversation in the new series. I also spoke with JJ, the porn performer from Weird Weekends. He says he doesn’t regret a minute of being in the industry, describing it as an enriching and important part of his life. What you might think would be self-destructive, can sometimes end up being lifesaving.Of the various updates, one of the most moving for me, personally, was one I did about the aforementioned UFO believer with weird hair: the Rev Robert Short. Short was a “space channel”, meaning he could summon the personality of an entity, called Korton from the planet Koldas, and he would prognosticate in booming tones from an outbuilding at his unassuming house on the outskirts of Cornville, Arizona. I first saw him channel back in 1997, for a programme about aliens. It was a moment of comedy in the finished film. The weirdness of the voices and mannerisms and the outlandishness of Short’s claims couldn’t help coming across as funny. He died late last year, but we found some extraordinary footage that shows him, a year or two ago, though enfeebled and poignantly reduced, still channelling his alien friend. It’s almost as though he’s beaming to me from beyond the grave, and so, in a short space in the film we go from finding him amusing and maybe even ridiculous, to seeing him in a way that is wistful and rather moving.I suppose this ability to see a contributor in a new, more three-dimensional way brings up the question of changes in me. When I look at my own motivations and my own journey, I am forced to face the negative alongside the positive: a tendency, when younger, to maybe be glib, to disarm with the aim of making light of people’s deeply held beliefs, to act the clown, to make fun. That was part of how I saw my role, to be the straight man in a weird world, and there were times, looking back, when I see I may have gone too far. I also acknowledge my own sense of attraction to the dark side – the darkness of misguided beliefs and self-destructive behaviours. But – as I comment at the end of the programme dedicated to the dark side of pleasure – the aim of life shouldn’t be to avoid mistakes, to be sober, righteous and godly in everything, to be pious and upstanding and utterly bland. You have to wrap your arms around the whole of life, and – at the risk of sounding like my Las Vegas self-help guru friend – view your missteps as an important part of your journey.And it may be my mistakes – or at least the challenges I endured in order to change – that, looking back, I’m most attached to, because they suggested the possibility of doing things differently. After 25-plus years of doing my job, what strikes me is the development and evolution that has taken place. When I started out in 1994, it would have seemed ludicrous to imagine having the maturity, sensitivity and storytelling chops to make programmes about disability, mental health and addiction. Yet these are the themes that have dominated my most recent programmes – subjects such as eating disorders, dementia and brain injury. They sprang from a process that begun in 2011 when, stuck for subjects to cover, I made a documentary about dementia, even though I knew that for the first time I would be making a documentary in which no one was making a wrong or questionable choice. The success of that episode, and the pleasure of making it, led to other documentaries about families and relationships under stress from forces outside their control. They feature most in the final episode of our new series, about family. They involve people who are in different way vulnerable, struggling and doing the best that can as they battle the vicissitudes of fate. It’s a film that is, more than any of the others, about love. The rewards it brings, the emotional enrichment, how much we suffer in the course of preserving it and nurturing it, and the risk it entails: the possibility that in giving your heart away, it will be hurt.In The Importance of Being Earnest, Oscar Wilde defines fiction as requiring that the good end happily and the bad unhappily. It turns out, surprise surprise, the world isn’t like that. Making my programmes has been among other things, a reminder – were it needed – of how unfair life is, how hard many people have it and how much they have to overcome. Doing the work of documentary-presenting about people and worlds that are in different ways on the edge has left its marks on me, too. But so has 25 years of living, marrying, having children, moving countries, taking out the rubbish, loading and unloading the dishwasher, fighting with those close to me, failing in small duties, succeeding in others and performing the multitude of rituals that make up the bulk of what it is we call life. As I look out, with these eyes, with these thoughts, I don’t notice myself being so very different. I feel like the same person. The texture of my mind and my thought hasn’t changed. It is mainly when I see myself on screen that I see the change. I’m 50 now. The ravages of the ageing process have left their mark. My hair is grey, my eyes don’t work as well as they used to, my knees are going.If I looked like a plonker before, now I look like an old plonker. Maybe that’s progress.Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge is on BBC Two next month"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d24e407556da3e207d2403779ba9b0e77231a7c/0_126_5305_3185/master/5305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df4847fa0799a36e507252a8cd27dc99","title":"louis dejoy postmaster general usps house hearing","story":"During House hearing, postmaster general concedes changes he implemented led to delays, but says he will not restore mail boxesUS postmaster general Louis DeJoy struggled to answer basic questions about the price of mail as he continued to defend his leadership at the United States Postal Service (USPS) amid reports of widespread mail delays across the US.Appearing before the House oversight committee on Monday, DeJoy, a major Republican donor who took over as postmaster general in June, again conceded changes he implemented had led to delays, but distanced himself from the decision to remove mail boxes from the street and sorting machines from mail facilities.He declined to say who was responsible for those changes, but reiterated that he will not restore the equipment, even after he announced earlier this month he was pausing changes until after the election.“I did not direct the removal of blue collection boxes or mail processing equipment,” he said.Representative Carolyn Maloney, the New York Democrat who chairs the committee, pressed DeJoy over newly obtained documents showing declines in mail delivery times since he became the postmaster general. DeJoy did not dispute the decline and conceded that a recent change he implemented to get USPS trucks to run more on schedule had contributed to the delays. The schedules at mail processing plants, DeJoy said, weren’t aligning with the on-time truck schedules, leading some mail to be delivered late.“While we have had temporary service declines, which should not have happened, we are fixing this,” DeJoy said. DeJoy conceded on Monday he was still trying to figure out why the problems had persisted over weeks. DeJoy offered few details on what analyses, if any, USPS had done before implementing the program to try and get trucks to run on time.The postmaster general also reiterated a pledge he made Friday during a US Senate hearing that USPS, the federal agency, has the capacity to deliver mail-in ballots this fall and that delivering them in a timely way was a priority for the agency. But he offered few details on what exactly USPS would do to facilitate timely delivery of ballots in the run-up to the election.In one remarkable exchange with congresswoman Katie Porter, a California Democrat, DeJoy was unable to supply basic information about post office costs. While he correctly told Porter the price of a stamp was 55 cents, he conceded that he did not know the cost of sending a postcard in the US (it costs 35 cents).“I’ll submit that I know very little about postage stamps,” DeJoy said. He also said he was unaware of how many people voted by mail in the last election, even as he pledged USPS had the capacity to safely deliver ballots. Just over 31 million voters cast ballots by mail in the 2018 midterm election, about a quarter of all ballots cast.“I’m glad you know the price of a stamp, but I’m concerned about your understanding of this agency,” Porter said. “I’m concerned about it because you started taking very decisive action when you became postmaster general.”Nonetheless, Republicans on the committee sought to downplay the delays and offered full-throated support of DeJoy during the hearing. They noted USPS has long suffered from financial woes and portrayed DeJoy as an outsider qualified to overhaul the agency.David Williams, a former member of the USPS board of governors, told House members last week that DeJoy did not appear to be a “serious candidate” for postmaster general when the board interviewed him. He struggled to answer basic questions, Williams said, and another governor had to step in and complete answers for him.Some of the hearing’s most tense moments came when Democrats pressed DeJoy about potential conflicts of interest or political interference at the agency. When congressman Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, asked DeJoy whether he had provided extra compensation to employees who donated to Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, DeJoy said he had not. “I resent the assertion sir. What are you accusing me of?” he said.Cooper asked DeJoy whether his “backup plan” was to be “pardoned like Roger Stone”, referring to the Republican fixer and Trump confidant who had a prison sentence for felonies relating to the Trump-Russia investigation commuted by the president. DeJoy shook his head and said: “I have no comment on that. It’s not worth a comment.”DeJoy did make some commitments to ensuring ballots cast in the fall would be counted. The agency has long advised states to put ballots in the mail at least a week before election day, but DeJoy said the agency would expedite mail cast closer to election day. There have also been issues with ballots arriving at election offices without postmarks – a crucial feature to determine whether they can be counted – and DeJoy said the agency was going to try and implement a system to postmark as much as possible.Throughout the hearing, DeJoy said that he would not restore hundreds of sorting machines that have reportedly been removed from postal facilities across the country. When Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, asked him why he wouldn’t restore the machines if it meant restoring confidence in the election, DeJoy simply said “because they’re not needed. That’s why.”Khanna later got DeJoy to concede that restoring the machines would likely cost less than $1bn. Asked whether the machines could be restored if USPS got an additional $1bn, DeJoy said: “Get me the billion and I’ll put the machines in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58b43ccbc8c743eaf709541c1d68244e2d521369/88_0_2635_1582/master/2635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09b8e65c0e1147de74dd1ba84179d085","title":"st louis couple rnc mark patricia mccloskey","story":"Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who were filmed pointing guns at peaceful protesters in June, claim Democrats want to ‘abolish suburbs’A white St Louis couple facing charges for brandishing guns at peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters have baselessly accused Democrats of “protecting criminals from honest citizens” and trying to “abolish the suburbs”.In a pre-recorded speech to the Republican national convention on Monday night, Mark and Patricia McCloskey said the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, would invite unchecked lawlessness into American suburbs if he wins the November election.“It seems as if the Democrats no longer view the government’s job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens,” Mark McCloskey said, in one of many of the evening’s speeches that broke with the optimistic vision Republican organizers had promised.“Not a single person in the out-of-control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime. But you know who was? We were.”There is no evidence to support the claim the marchers were an “out-of-control mob”. Protesters filmed passing the couple were peaceful.The couple came into the national spotlight in June after they were captured on camera pointing weapons at demonstrators who marched past their mansion to protest against racism and police brutality. Donald Trump retweeted video footage of the incident.They appeared to be echoing Trump’s attempts to stoke racist fears among affluent, white suburban voters who have been abandoning the Republican party under his leadership.“They want to abolish the suburbs altogether by ending single-family home zoning,” Patricia McCloskey said of the Democrats, adding that the actions “would bring crime, lawlessness and low-quality apartments into thriving suburban neighborhoods”.“Make no mistake: no matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America.”Trump and his supporters have zeroed in on Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, an Obama-era program implemented in 2015 that was designed to reduce racial segregation in American suburbs. The president has claimed it would increase crime and lower house prices, claims that have been denounced as racist.Trump’s support among suburban voters has cratered amid his administration’s failure to contain the coronavirus pandemic, the ensuing economic crisis, as well as the president’s aggressive response to the nationwide protests against systemic racism, which polls suggest most Americans, including those in the country’s increasingly erse suburbs, support.Monday was the first of the four-night Republican convention, in which a dizzying array of misleading and fear-mongering claims were made about a range of issues from the administration’s coronavirus response to the notion that Biden would defund police departments, which Biden has denied.Lauren Gambino contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce652cfdda332049fd2a6d5fa9b5aa27cdb41bae/411_627_5035_3021/master/5035.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e2680bd9a6871917499ebdd9d245fbe8","title":"coronavirus live news gaza in lockdown following first local cases hong kong man re infected","story":"Four cases detected in Gaza outside of quarantine facilities First known case of re-infection prompts immunity concerns Usain bolt tests positive for Covid-19. Follow the latest updates As the debate about wearing face masks continues around the world - here’s an interesting story from Bloomberg about what happened in South Korea when one woman with coronavirus visited a Starbucks cafe north of Seoul earlier this month: more than two dozen patrons tested positive days later, but the four face mask-wearing employees escaped infection.Secondary school pupils in Scotland will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses from next Monday.Scotland’s education secretary John Swinney said the measure applies to all high schools but Swinney added that nobody should be sent home for not wearing a mask.This is not going to be mandatory. We are recommending this is what should be done and we will encourage schools to pursue that as part of the work to maintain safety within schools. It’s about making sure that everybody is looking out for each other.Yesterday, the Scottish government said that it had been consulting councils and teaching organisations about the measure after face coverings were recommended for secondary schools by the World Health Organization at the weekend.WHO said face coverings were useful where physical distancing between adults and pupils aged 12 and over was impossible, or in areas of high transmission.In England, prime minister Boris Johnson is being urged to impose the same measures, which he has thus far resisted.

The economic slump was much stronger than during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, and it represented the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970, the office said.The second quarter was a complete disaster. Regardless of whether it is about investments, private consumption, exports or even imports everything was in free fall.The German parliament has suspended the debt brake this year to allow the government to finance its crisis response and fiscal stimulus push with record new debt of 217.8 billion euros.The German central bank expects household spending to drive a strong recovery in the third quarter, though the economy might not reach its pre-crisis level before 2022.The government’s stimulus measures include a temporary VAT cut from July to December worth up to 20 billion euros, which Berlin hopes will give household spending an additional push.As officials across Spain wrestle with a surge in coronavirus cases, a chorus of voices is warning that another lockdown could have dire consequences for a country that just months ago emerged from one of Europe’s strictest confinements, reports Ashifa Kassam in Madrid.While cases of the virus have climbed across Europe, Spain has led the pack in recent days. More than 78,000 cases have been detected in the past two weeks, pushing the 14-day infection rate to 166 per 100,000, compared with 67 in France and 22 in the UK.Read the full story below:At the Republican convention in the US on Monday, President Donald Trump sought to distance himself from the impact of the coronavirus on the country and his administration’s handling of the crisis, referring to Covid-19 as the “plague from China”. Hong Kong is set to ease some coronavirus measures from 28 August, allowing venues such as cinemas and beauty parlours to reopen and restaurants to extend dining hours, authorities said on Tuesday. Reuters reports:Hong Kong had seen a resurgence of locally transmitted cases since the start of July but the daily number has fallen from triple digits in recent weeks to low double digits. Monday’s infection count of nine new cases was the lowest in nearly two months.Health secretary Sophia Chan said the government would allow outdoor sports centres to reopen and would lift mandatory mask wearing for outdoor sports and country parks. Restaurants would extend dining to 9pm having previously only been able to offer takeaways past 6pm.The government had imposed strict regulations at the start of July including the mandatory wearing of masks in all public outdoor places and a ban on gatherings of more than two people.The cap on the number of people that can meet would remain in place past Friday, and Chan gave no indication on when this would change.The relaxation of measures comes ahead of mass testing of residents in the Asian financial hub which is set to begin on 1 September. Since late January, about 4,700 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 77 of whom have died.A Hong Kong man who recovered from Covid-19 was re-infected four-and-a-half months later in what is the first documented instance of human re-infection, researchers at the University of Hong Kong said on Monday. This is a great video from the Ugandan ministry of health about why social distancing matters. Good morning from London, where I’ll be looking after the global coronavirus live blog for the next few hours. My thanks (and solidarity!) to my colleague Helen Sullivan in Sydney. If you want to get in touch with stories from where you are please do. My email is alexandra.topping@the and I’m @lexytopping on Twitter. My DMs are open. Reuters has a fascinating story this morning on the scientific discoveries that are being made about Covid-19. They report:“Genetic barcodes” can help track how the new coronavirus spreads and mutates, researchers said on Saturday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. Based on the sequence of the genetic code of the virus, the researchers identified 11 distinct SARS-CoV-2 “barcodes” that represent different clades, or lineages, descended from a common viral ancestor.Different continents have different variations, Arnab Pain of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia and his team found. The subtle differences in the genetic sequences represented by the barcodes may affect virus infectivity or illness severity, Pain noted.The researchers plan to regularly update the barcodes. “This is a dynamic process, and some virus cladessubclades may eventually die off in the future, and new clades may form,” Pain said.That’s it for me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I’m having four wisdom teeth yanked from my jaws tomorrow and won’t be blogging for a few days.My colleague Alexandra Topping will be taking you through the next few hours of pandemic news. Residents in the capital of Xinjiang are being forced to take Chinese medicine, being handcuffed to buildings and ordered to stay inside for weeks as part of a harsh range of measures to tackle coronavirus, it has emerged.Urumqi, the capital of the semi-autonomous region known for its draconian security measures, has been in a “wartime state” of lockdown for more than a month after a cluster of cases emerged in July, when the outbreak had been mostly contained elsewhere in China.Since Friday, internet users have flooded social media platforms with complaints about overly harsh measures and extended quarantine at home or in designated locations, even as cases have gone down. The city, which had documented more than 531 cases by mid-August, has not seen new cases in eight consecutive days:Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The convention kept factcheckers busy as the RNC peddled falsehoods about the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans praised Trump’s response to the pandemic and accused Democrats and the media of failing to recognize the threat posed by coronavirus, even though the president has said as recently as this month that the virus “will go away”. The first cases of coronavirus have been detected within the Gaza Strip outside its quarantine facilities, Palestinian officials have said, a potentially disastrous development given the enclave’s fragile health system.Four people from the same family have so far tested positive for coronavirus, Gaza’s interior ministry said on Monday as authorities imposed a 48-hour lockdown.“As soon as the virus cases were detected, the leadership of the interior ministry and the crisis unit held intensive meetings,” said ministry spokesman Iyad al-Bazam.Hamas authorities urged Gazans to abide by the immediate shutdown, which includes the closure of workplaces, schools and mosques: Mexican health authorities will begin this week to use a broader definition to identify possible coronavirus cases, a top official said on Monday, after questions about whether testing was too limited, Reuters reports. A new definition of “suspected” infections will come into use on Tuesday and will include loss of smell, loss of taste and diarrhea as possible Covid-19 symptoms, Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said.It will also allow a person with just one symptom, rather than two or more, to be viewed as potentially infected.“This gives you a larger margin of potential, which will result in faster, timelier attention for a greater number of people,” Lopez-Gatell told a news conference.The broader definition could lead to a higher number of cases but that would be an “artificial effect” before stabilizing, he said.Mexico’s policy is to apply tests to people who show sufficient symptoms, he noted.Mexico on Monday reported 3,541 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 320 more fatalities, bringing its total tallies to 563,705 cases and 60,800 deaths.Boris Johnson must meet families whose relatives have been killed by coronavirus and fund research into the longer-term effects, known as “long Covid”, to help the pandemic’s forgotten victims, MPs have said.Their recommendations form part of a fresh set of demands made on the prime minister intended to shape how he prepares for a potential second wave of the illness this autumn.MPs on the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on coronavirus inquiry, which releases recommendations every two weeks, have heard from more than 1,100 people who have either lost loved ones to the illness, or who continue to suffer its long-term effects.One woman wrote how she had no choice but to say goodbye to her father over a rushed video call only made possible because a nurse lent him her personal mobile. He later died alone: Not strictly coronavirus-related, but is perhaps some needed good news: The World Health Organization (WHO) is set to certify on Tuesday that the African continent is free from wild polio, four years after the last cases appeared in northeastern Nigeria, AFP reports. “Thanks to the relentless efforts by governments, donors, frontline health workers and communities, up to 1.8 million children have been saved from the crippling life-long paralysis,” the WHO said in a statement.“Happiness is an understatement. We’ve been on this marathon for over 30 years,” said Tunji Funsho, a Nigerian doctor and local anti-polio coordinator for Rotary International.He said it marked a crucial step in the total eradication of the illness at the global level.“It’s a real achievement, I feel joy and relief at the same time,” he added.As officials across Spain wrestle with a surge in coronavirus cases, a chorus of voices is warning that another lockdown could have dire consequences for a country that just months ago emerged from one of Europe’s strictest confinements.While cases of the virus have climbed across Europe, Spain has led the pack in recent days. More than 78,000 cases have been detected in the past two weeks, pushing the 14-day infection rate to 166 per 100,000, compared with 67 in France and 22 in the UK.The steady rise has raised the spectre of fresh lockdowns in the coming weeks, particularly in Madrid where unions have warned that the primary care system is “on the edge of collapse”, due to a lack of staff and testing resources:I’ll still be bringing you the latest for a little while. Seen anything I’ve missed – or that might make our readers laugh?Get in touch:Uki Goñi reports for the  from Argentina: A 34-year-old doctor in Argentina is the country’s first confirmed case of someone who, after having recovered from Covid-19, fell ill with the virus a second time four months later.On Monday, a Hong Kong man who recovered from Covid-19 was infected again four-and-a-half months later in what researchers at the University of Hong Kong said was the first documented instance of human re-infection.In Argentina, Alejandra Müller, a hospital director in the town of Helvecia in the central province of Santa Fe, was first diagnosed with Covid-19 on 24 March, after acquiring the virus from a child who had fallen ill. Müller recovered from the virus and, after testing negative, was able to return to her job.“That first time I was back at work after two weeks, having had only some chest pain, some throat congestion, a bit of fever and pharyngitis,” Müller told the daily La Nación. The doctor submitted to two tests in April, both of which came back negative, before receiving the all clear. “I thought I had acquired immunity,” Müller said.But four months later Müller fell ill with the virus again, much harder this time. “The second time the infection was completely different,” said Müller. The doctor developed pneumonia at the end of July and had to go into hospital for five days. “I had all the symptoms, except losing my sense of taste, though I did lose my senseof smell.”Müller’s samples from both infections, in March and July, have been sent to the capital city of Buenos Aires for analysis and study. “Maybe she developed few antibodies because she only had a mild infection the first time,” said doctor Eduardo López, a government coronavirus expert in Buenos Aires.Argentina had a record-breaking 8,713 new cases and 382 coronavirus-related deaths Monday, with nearly 351 thousand accumulated cases and 7,366 deaths so far."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337818.1598293036!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 and teachers i am paranoid anxious and cautious","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeacher with health issues was given a report stating he was “high risk” and not “very high risk”, so he would be expected at his desk when school reopened. Photograph: iStock“It is constantly in my head. It is a very anxious time,” says Tomas (to protect his identity we are not using his real name), a 60-year-old secondary school teacher ordered to return to work next week despite having cancer and a heart condition, which leave him at high risk of contracting Covid-19.Last week, he filled out the online risk assessment for returning to school, which he believed, because of his renal carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer for which he had part of his kidney removed last year, and his angioplasty and stent insertion, would allow him to work from home.As part of the process, he was asked for an up-to-date report from his consultant.“Let’s just say he’d prefer if I didn’t return to the workplace,” he said.Just days later a report was emailed back to him stating that he was simply “high risk” and not “very high risk”, so he would be expected at his desk when the school gates reopened.The only advice was to socially distance and take the appropriate hygiene measures.Bolt from blue“It was a bolt out of the blue, considering my conditions,” he said. “I do want to go back to work sometime but I don’t feel now is the appropriate time.”A teacher for 40 years, Tomas has been cocooning to protect himself at home since the start of the pandemic. His wife and two children, with whom he lives, have also been limiting their social contacts because of his illnesses.With his medical conditions, he has been “paranoid, anxious and cautious” about coronavirus.Now, faced with having to mix with large groups of children and adults in his school, where “space is very much limited”, he says a “plethora of worries” are weighing on him.“It’s not safe at the moment,” he said.“I’m particularly worried about the areas in the school that become congested at times.‘Lax with time’“I know we’ll all be very careful at the start, but people will get more lax in time. Kids are kids, and they have to be kids.”Break times are another concern, he says, adding that he is worried about the impact the stress will have on his ability to focus on his teaching.“Normally, when you go to work you just worry about work – now I have this other worry hovering over my head.“It seems to be a fait accompli.“My worst fear is that I will contract Covid and all the risks that go with that, even developing another serious illness from contracting it.

Video: RTE\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tActing Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn during a press briefing at Government Buildings in Dublin. Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireThe State’s public health emergency team has issued a “note of caution” about rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in Dublin where people should take “extra care” to prevent spreading the virus.There were a further 147 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team, including 73 in Dublin. No further deaths were reported.This brings total confirmed cases to 28,116 with the death toll from the virus remaining at 1,777.Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn told a press briefing that there was not a major problem with rising cases in Dublin over the last number of days but that it was “something that we are watching closely.”“It is not an alarm it is simply a note of caution for people to take care and take all the basic measures,” he said, referring to the long-standing public health measures that people should follow and last week’s specific guidance to avoid house parties and other larger gatherings.The increased cases in Dublin were spread across the county but the number of infections were “slightly higher” in Dublin West, Dublin North West and Dublin North Central, he said.“Unlike what we saw in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, there isn’t one or two defined clusters guiding this in Dublin. It is spread out across areas, across settings, across workplaces and with a significant proportion of community transmission,” he said.One in three Dublin cases are from community transmission, which is higher than one-in-five national average. Some 34 of the 73 Dublin cases are close contacts of other Covid-19 cases.There was “no suggestion” that a county lockdown or any further restrictions were needed in Dublin and that if people followed guidance, the benefits would be seen next week, said Dr Glynn.Countrywide, there were 27 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals, including six in critical care units, and that this was up from 17 last Thursday. “We do need to monitor that very closely,” said Dr Glynn.He challenged claims from some commentators that the pandemic was now a “case-demic”, that public health officials should “stop worrying” and that “the virus has weakened.” “That is simply not the case,” he said. If cases kept rising, “it will only be a matter of time before it spreads into other groups,” he said.SchoolsDr Mary Favier, president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, acknowledged the anxiety amongst parents with schools reopening this week.She said parents should not worry about children who “have a runny nose for every single day of winter” but should “start to pay attention” when children have a high temperature, a cough or other respiratory symptoms and should keep them home for 48 hours until symptoms settle.Dr Glynn said it “won’t be a surprise” if there are cases among schoolchildren but the challenge was “to response to that appropriately and listen to the appropriate information sources.”There were 84 children under the age of 14 last week who tested positive for Covid-19 and overall children under 14 accounted for less than three per cent of cases.“The vast, vast majority who have Covid have very mild, if any symptoms,” he said.“If we can suppress this and keep this low in our community, we can protect our children and protect our education system.”Dr Glynn said he didn’t believe that it was possible to pursue a strategy to eliminate Covid-19 completely and that Nphet’s strategy was to “keep the cases as low as possible” and to protect education, vulnerable people and healthcare.Dr Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said that alternative testing methods were being evaluated for children, including saliva testing.Some 57,670 Covid-19 tests were conducted last week with a 1.3 per cent positivity rate.There were two new Covid-19 outbreaks reported at direct provision centres, in Bray and in Limerick and eight new cases spread over all eight outbreaks in these centres.Separately, another 10 cases of Covid-19 have been reported across Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours.There have been no more deaths.The first pupils have returned to schools across Northern Ireland since the coronavirus lockdown started in March. Some parents have expressed concerns while teachers’ unions say educators had not been given enough time to respond to rules issued earlier this month.Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride has insisted it is safe to return.

The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"british museum removes bust slave owner founder sir hans sloane","story":"The British Museum has removed a bust of its founding father from its pedestal and labelled him a “slave owner” in an attempt to confront its links to colonialism, the institution’s director has announced.Sir Hans Sloane’s likeness has instead been placed in a secure cabinet alongside artefacts that explain his work in the “exploitative context of the British Empire”.The decision was signed off by Hartwig Fischer, the museum director, and revealed in an interview in The Daily  on Monday.“We have pushed him off the pedestal,” Mr Fischer said. “We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge.”It is part of a wider process of acknowledging the museum’s links to slavery, curators said.Other artefacts, including those taken by Captain James Cook on his voyages, will be given new labels explaining how they were acquired by the museum through “colonial conquest and military looting”. Mr Fischer said: “Dedication to truthfulness when it comes to history is absolutely crucial, with the aim to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history.“The case dedicated to Hans Sloane and his relationship to slavery is a very important step in this.“We have pushed him off the pedestal where nobody looked at him, and placed him in the limelight.“The British Museum has done a lot of work – accelerated and enlarged its work on its own history, the history of empire, the history of colonialism, and also of slavery. These are subjects which need to be addressed, and to be addressed properly. We need to understand our own history.”The decision to revisit Sloane’s past was made during lockdown in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, which sparked debate around statues of controversial historical figures in public spaces. In June, a statue of Edward Colston was removed from its plinth by protesters in Bristol.The Rhodes Must Fall campaign in Oxford also successfully called for the removal of a statue of philanthropist Cecil Rhodes.Neal Spencer, keeper of Nile and Mediterranean objects and the curator behind the new Sloane display, said that “Black Lives Matter provides a certain level of urgency”.He added: “It’s expected of museums today. The collection is owned by the public in the widest sense.“We want to be upfront about Sloane’s collection being at the root of the British Museum. And we want to put it in a wider context, which is obviously a very difficult context.“It happened in the exploitative context of the British Empire. I wouldn’t describe it as an imperialist organisation, but it is a museum that was founded within the context of Empire.“Eventually we’re going to be redisplaying the whole British Museum. We want to tell more of these stories.“We want to talk more about the context of how the museum was founded.”Sloane’s collection of 71,000 artefacts became the starting point of the British Museum after being bequeathed to the state in his will.The Irish-born collector, known for London street names such as Sloane Square, and being the purported inventor of drinking chocolate, also had investments in the slave-trading Royal African and South Sea Companies.These facts are now noted on labels beside his terracotta bust, which is surrounded by tokens of the slave trade and its legacy.A panel beside Sloane’s bust explains that this collection was “enabled by the wealth and networks that grew out of European imperialism”.New labels also state that this bequeathed hoard contained “anatomical specimens relating to skin colour and theories of racial difference”.While the origins of the foundational collection are being examined, a new “trail” for visitors will allow them to move through the museum on a themed tour of 16 objects unjustly taken from far-flung places in the days of Empire.This trail will not include the Parthenon Marbles – also known as the Elgin Marbles – which have long been the subject of demands for repatriation to Greece after being taken from the Acropolis in the early 19th century.Mr Fischer is determined that in the coming years the long-term commitment of the museum to being open about its imperial heritage will lead to an overhaul in the information available to members of the public visiting in future.He said: “This is not just about empire and colonialism, and European expansion across the world in the last 500 years.“It is also setting this in the wider context of human history.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no amount caffeine safe pregnant women experts call radical","story":"No amount of caffeine is safe in pregnancy or for women trying for a baby, research suggests.Current guidelines suggest that such women can safely drink around two cups of instant coffee a day without affecting their unborn baby\u0027s health.But a review of almost 50 studies, published in BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, suggests there is no safe level of caffeine consumption in such circumstances.Researchers called for a radical revision of current health guidelines - advising those who are pregnant or trying to conceive to cut out caffeine entirely.Scientists examined 48 observational studies and meta-analyses which examined links between caffeine and up to six negative pregnancy outcomes. These were miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight or size, preterm birth, childhood acute leukaemia, and childhood obesity.A total of 42 separate findings were reported of these 32 found that caffeine significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and 10 found no or inconclusive associations.Professor Jack James of Reykjavik University, Iceland, said: Caffeine-related risk was reported with moderate to high levels of consistency for all pregnancy outcomes except preterm birth.”Fourteen of the studies linked maternal caffeine consumption with increased risk of four adverse outcomes: miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, and childhood acute leukaemia.The studies were observational, meaning they could not prove that caffeine intake caused the risk. However, researchers said it was likely that caffeine was the cause, as the chance of negative outcomes increased depending on how much was drunk. No level of caffeine consumption was found to be free of risk. Until now, pregnant women have been advised until now that consuming a small amount of caffeine daily will not harm their baby.The NHS and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both suggest that the safe limit is 200 mg caffeine, which is the equivalent to around two cups of moderate-strength coffee per day.Professor James said such advice “is not consistent with the level of threat” shown by the research.He said: “Current health recommendations concerning caffeine consumption during pregnancy are in need of radical revision. Specifically, the cumulative scientific evidence supports pregnant women and women contemplating pregnancy being advised to avoid caffeine.”Caffeine is a stimulant and can increase blood pressure, heart rate and stress hormones.  A number of studies on caffeine have had contradictory results, with some research suggesting that more than 200g a day can double the risk of miscarriage, while other studies found that up to 300g was safe. Scientists said women who drank a lot of caffeine might be more likely to have unhealthy habits, which might not be fully taken into account. Dr Daghni Rajasingham, Consultant Obstetrician and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “The findings of this study add to the large body of evidence that supports limited caffeine intake during pregnancy, but pregnant women do not need to completely cut out caffeine, as this paper suggests.“As the study notes, high levels of caffeine during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage and babies having a low birth weight, and may lead to excess weight gain in the child’s early years, which can increase risk of health problems later in life. However, as other – and potentially more reliable - research has found, pregnant women do not need to cut caffeine out entirely because these risks are extremely small, even if the recommended caffeine limits are exceeded.“The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ advise to limit caffeine intake to 200 milligrams (mg) per day – the equivalent to two cups of instant coffee – still stands. This paper does not supersede all the other evidence that has found that a limited intake of caffeine is safe for the majority of pregnant women.”Dr Adam Jacobs, Associate Director of Biostatistics, Premier Research, said: “Given that pregnant women have been advised to avoid excessive caffeine consumption for at least the last 40 years, you might expect that women who drink coffee during pregnancy are generally less likely to follow health advice, and possibly in some ways which are quite hard to measure. “Overall, I think if I were a pregnant woman, I don\u0027t think this paper would make me overly concerned about drinking the occasional cup of coffee.”Prof Andrew Shennan, Professor of Obstetrics, King\u0027s College London, said it was possible that women were under-estimating their coffee consumption, and said it remained clear that high doses of caffeine did most harm. “It is well known that women may report lower intake then actual consumption in studies and could explain why lower caffeine intake looks harmful,” he said. “The authors conclude the advice from health bodies such as the NHS needs to radically change and they advise avoiding all caffeine. However the observational nature of this data with its inherent bias does not indicate with any certainty that low doses of caffeine are harmful, and the current advice to avoid high doses of caffeine are unlikely to change.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks national interest joe biden wins presidential race","story":"As the United States embarks on what might be its most acrimonious election in living memory, what outcome would be in the interests of the UK? A case can be made that the first term of President Trump has been not too bad from the British point of view. He is warm towards Britain, likes our Prime Minister and is in favour of a free trade deal. His administration has backed us up at some crucial moments, such as over the Salisbury poisonings, or China’s breach of its agreements with us over Hong Kong. He never looks happier abroad, or behaves with more decorum, than when visiting the Queen.These are actions we can appreciate, as are the tireless efforts of American diplomats to keep cooperation with allies on the road. Trump’s inability to keep a team together – with repeated changes of defence secretary, national security adviser and senior intelligence officials – has been damaging, but at lower levels the US system works closely with us every day, sharing valuable intelligence, keeping our militaries aligned and helping with law enforcement.Furthermore, it can be argued, many of Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements are part of a longer-term trend in US thinking. His attitude to China is symptomatic of Washington waking up to the rise of a new strategic adversary. The lectures to allies about paying their own way are an extension of appeals made by Obama, albeit more threatening. And his desire to bring troops home from Syria and Afghanistan is also part of a common American exhaustion after Iraq, even if more erratic and temperamental.So far, so much relief. Trump has not wrecked Nato or blown up the world. Yet we British have to recognise that something is fundamentally wrong. Something vital to us, as a medium-sized, transatlantic, democratic nation, is missing. We need the US to be the active leader of a network of alliances, of which we are a part, and to combine its great financial and physical strength with moral authority and respected global leadership. In the next four years, the need for that leadership will be as vital as it ever has been since the end of the Cold War. No other country can come close to providing it. And we have seen enough now to know that Donald Trump is not going to give it.The Covid-19 crisis has been, as in so many ways, a revelatory moment. Leave aside the chaotic domestic response in America – we have not been in a position to preach, and Europe’s problems are far from over. But the most striking aspect of the crisis has been the absence of any attempt at global leadership. The one person who could have moved other nations and his own to take it seriously, to coordinate policies, to consult on closing borders, share vaccine research, and act to prevent future pandemics, was the US president. The leader who could have summoned the G20, and even now could be ensuring sufficient support for developing countries to prevent a health and economic meltdown with far-reaching consequences, is in the White House.Next year, the UK will host the Cop26, the world conference on climate change. It will be the most crucial such meeting since Paris in 2015, and a decisive moment in seeking agreement from all countries to take necessary action. The Trump administration is uninterested in such issues and even hostile to addressing them. Within the US, it is pushing ahead with the obscenity of drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Internationally, it is unwilling to give the lead that would bring a global agreement within reach.Other issues of vast and lasting importance are coming to a head. Rivalry with China may well be unavoidable, but we need America to be at the centre of strong alliances as it faces up to that, not striking out on its own. Trump’s early decision to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership weakened his own country’s position on international trade, and the value to this country of ultimately joining the pact. More widely on China, Western countries are on the strongest ground when opposing totalitarian behaviour but still seeking a framework of coordination with Beijing on pressing global issues – arms control, climate change, and economic stability. Trump, however, often seems to have this the wrong way round: raising few objections to dictatorship while failing to find a constructive framework.One excruciating extract of the book by the most recently departed national security adviser, John Bolton, recounted how “Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do.” This is part of a pattern: he greeted Xi Jinping becoming president indefinitely with “I think it’s great”, said Kim Jong-Un had “a great and beautiful vision” for his country and has repeatedly raised inviting Putin to the G7, despite the deep discomfort of the leaders of other free nations.At a time when democracies, though resilient, are under the great strains of internal discontent and growing external interference, this disdain for the values of freedom and democracy is deeply damaging to the West. It is amplified by Trump’s unsubstantiated charges of fraudulent voting in his own country, intended to undermine confidence in any unwelcome result. \u2028It is in the vital interests of the UK that America, our indispensable ally, is ironclad and steadfast in its attachment to democracy at home and abroad: the capital and the arsenal of freedom.Last week, 73 former US national security officials who worked under the Reagan and Bush presidencies called on Republicans to forsake their party and vote for Joe Biden. Many British Conservatives, even those of us with decades-long friendships among Republicans, will feel the same. Biden will face his own problems, particularly of how to restrain the Left of his own party. But if he wins, which is by no means certain, he is committed to uphold human rights and democracy, persuade other countries to join the US in more ambitious environmental goals, and “restore a commitment to science and truth in government”. Such an approach would be good for the world and for America. And that means it would be good for Britain.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rule britannia freedom not slavery","story":"The BBC is in charge of the Proms, and is proud of their wide appeal. It says on its own website: “Last Night of the Proms is one of the most popular nights for the whole of the BBC Proms.” Does it ask itself why? It may have something to do with the fact that Rule, Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory are always sung that evening, with the audience enthusiastically joining in.For years now, pressure groups have complained about these songs. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, protests have grown louder. This year’s all-encompassing excuse of Covid-19 is also being deployed. Allegedly, the large quantity of players required to make the right noise might send the virus flying round the Albert Hall.Critics of Rule, Britannia fasten on a few words. One verse rejects “haughty tyrants”. According to Chi-Chi Nwanoku, a principal double bass player, this is dreadful because the British are so describing those whose land they invade. In fact, the meaning is the exact opposite: it warns against haughty tyrants – unparliamentary European powers of the mid-18th century, such as France and Spain – who might wish to invade us.As for the famous line, “Britons never will be slaves”, this is taken by Wasfi Kani, of Grange Park Opera, to suggest that “someone else can be slaves.The words contain no evidence for that interpretation. They first appeared in Thomas Arne’s 1740 masque, Alfred, about the English King (of burnt cakes legend) who defeated the invading Vikings, thus helping forge the nation. The beings in Rule, Britannia who sing about Britons never being slaves are the “ angels” who oversaw the birth of Britain “from out the azure main”. Their message is that we are born free. So last night the BBC announced that the music stays but the wicked words will go. British people value their freedom. A good many of them like celebrating it with the traditional songs of liberty. If the BBC has difficulty with that, what does it understand about the people from whom it collects the licence fee?The BBC is, however, devoting a radio programme tonight to “code-switching”. The term comes from linguistics. It means the way in which people can move between types of language or different languages in the course of the same conversation. “Franglais” would be a jokey example.Now, however, in our hypersensitive world, it has become another thing we must blame on white supremacy. It is said that black people who work with white people must code-switch to survive. They have to adopt “white” locutions and suppress their accustomed ways of talking.There can be no doubt that such code-switching takes place. But what else would one expect? It applies to any work environment in which people come from different backgrounds. In order to understand one another clearly in the workplace, a particular way of speech will tend to prevail.Thus, until about 40 years ago, the BBC always favoured the “public-school” accent among its presenters. People with regional or working-class accents had to code-switch in order to read the news. Nowadays, it is the other way round. People with public-school backgrounds have to code-switch to “mockney” in order to get on in the BBC.When I was a boy, I attended the village school, but was brought up at home with “received pronunciation”. One day, when schoolfriends came home to tea, my parents taped our conversation. The recording showed me unconsciously code-switching between fellow-pupils and my parents.Surely such adjustments are amusing, and sometimes necessary, rather than yet another thing to get furious about.I am so old that I can remember when Joe Biden first tried to become president of the United States. In the autumn of 1987, Mr Biden got into trouble for pinching speech phrases from Neil Kinnock, then the British Labour leader. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” Mr Kinnock had asked in Wales, in May.In Iowa, in August 1987, Mr Biden said, “I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?” He was “the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree”. Both men argued that their forebears had suffered not from stupidity, but lack of opportunity. Mr Biden did not acknowledge the phrase as Mr Kinnock’s. He did not get the nomination.Part of the comedy was the idea of a thousand generations of Kinnocks, or Bidens. For that, one would have to go back to before the invention of the wheel. It is only about 20 generations to the invention of the university.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/24/21/gettyimages-51496035.jpg","title":"barbara heporth google doodle abstract sculptor artish british","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Barbara Hepworth, an influential English sculptor whose work remains preserved in St Ives, Cornwall, is being celebrated, 45 years after her death.Hepworth’s work is the subject of a special Google Doodle going live on 25 August, which depicts her carving out one of her abstract works.The artist, born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, produced some of the earliest abstract sculptures in England, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe studied at the Leeds school of Art in the early 1920s before enrolling at the Royal College of Art.Her earlier works featured classic, naturalistic elements, but over time moved towards more abstract shapes.“Though concerned with form and abstraction, Hepworth’s art was primarily about relationships: not merely between two forms presented side-by-side, but between the human figure and the landscape, colour and texture, and most importantly between people at an inidual and social level,” notes the Tate, which operates Hepworth’s museum and sculpture garden in St Ives.Hepworth lived and worked in St Ives from 1949 to her death on 20 May 1975.Among other achievements, the sculptor was awarded the first prize at the 1959 São Paulo Bienal.She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire six years later, in 1965.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would cover not only Fortnite but also the variety of games that require Epic\u0027s software – not only its own titles, such as Fortnite, but a variety of third-party ones too.Apple issues rare apology in latest App Store controversyIn response to that threat, Epic began separate legal proceedings with the hope of securing an injunction that would stop Apple from carrying out on that threat.Now Xbox, part of Microsoft, has thrown its support behind Epic\u0027s request, filing a statement with a court in California that gave backing to the demand that it keeps access to its development tools.Epic losing access to Apple\u0027s development tools would impact other software beyond Fortnite, including its Unreal Engine gaming software, which is used by many other game developers, including Microsoft, to build their own products on.Today we filed a statement in support of Epic\u0027s request to keep access to the Apple SDK for its Unreal Engine, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in a tweet.Ensuring that Epic has access to the latest Apple technology is the right thing for gamer developers \u0026amp gamers.In the statement, filed to a US district court in California, Microsoft\u0027s general manager for gaming developer experiences, Kevin Gammill, said: Epic Games\u0027 Unreal Engine is critical technology for numerous game creators including Microsoft.He added that many other, smaller developers can not afford to build their own gaming engines, so are reliant on third-party software such as the Unreal Engine.As a result, Epic\u0027s Unreal Engine is one of the most popular third-party game engines available to game creators, and in Microsoft\u0027s view there are very few other options available for creators to license with as many features and as much functionality as Unreal Engine across multiple platforms, including iOS, Mr Gammill said.Denying Epic access to Apple\u0027s SDK and other development tools will prevent Epic from supporting Unreal Engine on iOS and macOS, and will place Unreal Engine and those game creators that have built, are building, and may build games on it at a substantial disadvantage.Because iOS is a large and growing market for games, Apple\u0027s discontinuation of Unreal Engine\u0027s ability to support iOS will be a material disadvantage for the Unreal Engine in future decisions by Microsoft and other game creators as to the choice of an engine for new games.Apple\u0027s discontinuation of Epic\u0027s ability to develop and support Unreal Engine for iOS or macOS will harm game creators and gamers.The dispute between Apple and Epic began when a payment option was added to Fortnite which allowed users to pay for in-game items directly through Epic.Both Apple and Google then removed Fortnite from their app stores, although mobile users on Google\u0027s Android can still download the app directly from Epic\u0027s website.The incident reignited debate around app store payment systems, which some developers have previously called unfair and anti-competitive.Apple has said Epic created the problem for itself but that it could easily be remedied if it updated Fortnite to comply with the guidelines they agreed to and which apply to all developers.The App Store is designed to be a safe and trusted place for users and a great business opportunity for all developers, the iPhone maker said.We won\u0027t make an exception for Epic because we don\u0027t think it\u0027s right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe NHS, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the European Food Safety Authority set this safe level of consumption at 200 mg of caffeine – the equivalent of roughly two cups of moderate-strength coffee per day.But Professor Jack James, a psychologist at Iceland’s Reykjavik University, said such advice was “not consistent with the level of threat”.His analysis concluded there was “substantial cumulative evidence” of a link between maternal caffeine consumption and erse negative pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriages and childhood obesity.Detrimental impact of stress during pregnancy ‘may last a lifetime’The study carried out a review of current evidence on caffeine-related pregnancy outcomes to determine whether the recommended safe level of consumption for pregnant women was soundly based. After examining data from 37 observational studies, Prof James found 32 of these studies reported that caffeine significantly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth, miscarriage and low birth weight.He also cited an increased risk of childhood acute leukaemia and children being overweight or obese when born to mothers who consume caffeine during pregnancy.The review found evidence for a link in five out of six negative pregnancy outcomes, excluding preterm birth.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Scientists have reported the world’s first case of a human being reinfected with the coronavirus in a discovery that could have significant implications for the development of vaccines, and hopes of natural immunity against the virus.Researchers at Hong Kong University’s department of microbiology said genetic sequencing of the virus showed that a Hong Kong man was infected twice by different versions of the coronavirus months apart.According to the study, the patient was a 33-year-old man who was in good health. When he was first infected, he suffered a cough, sore throat, fever and headache for three days. He had a test that confirmed Covid-19 and he was hospitalised on 29 March.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe was discharged on 14 April after two negative swab tests.Four months later, he was returning to Hong Kong from Spain via the UK when he tested positive during entry screening at Hong Kong airport on 15 August. He was hospitalised again but had no symptoms throughout.Experts cautioned against jumping to conclusions based on a single case, but they acknowledged that the discovery was a concern.Announcing the results, the Hong Kong University researchers said: “An apparently young and healthy patient had a second episode of Covid-19 infection which was diagnosed 4.5 months after the first episode.“This case illustrates that reinfection can occur just after a few months of recovery from the first infection. Our findings suggest that Sars-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“Since the immunity can be short-lasting after natural infection, vaccination should also be considered for those with one episode of infection.“Patients with previous Covid-19 infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing.”If the research, published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, is correct, then it could mean that vaccines against the virus do not give permanent protection and people will not be able to rely on being immune to the virus after recovering from an infection.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDr David Strain, from the University of Exeter, said: “This is a worrying finding for several reasons. The first, as is laid out in this manuscript, is that it suggests that previous infection is not protective. The second is that it raises the possibility that vaccinations may not provide the hope that we have been waiting for.“Vaccinations work by simulating infection to the body, thereby allowing the body to develop antibodies. If antibodies don’t provide lasting protection, we will need to revert to a strategy of viral near-elimination in order to return to a more normal life.”There have already been a number of reports of patients being reinfected with the virus, but these were based on clinical features of the disease. In this case, however, scientists used genetic sequencing to analyse the separate strains of the virus.Dr Jeffrey Barrett, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, urged caution over the news, arguing that it was hard to draw conclusions until the full research study had been published.He said: “This is certainly stronger evidence of reinfection than some of the previous reports because it uses the genome sequence of the virus to separate the two infections. It seems much more likely that this patient has two distinct infections than a single infection followed by a relapse.“An important point about this one case, which is not mentioned in the press release, is that the second infection is asymptomatic. It was caught by screening tests on returning passengers at HK airport, and the inidual never developed any symptoms from their second infection.”He said that given the number of global infections so far, one case of reinfection was not surprising and he warned that the research “implications” were too broad given it was based on one case.“This may be very rare, and it may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious (though we don’t know whether this person was infectious during their second episode).”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “The significant thing here is that being reinfected with a mutated strain demonstrates that it is more likely to be reinfection, rather than the same infection that has hung around because the virus has not actually been got rid of, as some people have suggested happens.“The finding of a mutant strain is absolutely nothing to be shocked or surprised by. It would actually be more interesting if there were no mutations cropping up.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, there is a drive-through testing site at Bristol airport around 25 minutes away.Some people with a Southampton postcode are being directed to Swindon – around a four-hour round trip.Problems with the booking system have been highlighted from early on in the crisis but it appears that glitches in the system – which seem to disproportionately affect those on the coast – are yet to be rectified.Labour said it was “hugely disappointing” that the issues were still occurring and called on the government to address the issues as a “matter of urgency”.Shadow health minister Justin Madders said: “From the first days when testing centres were being rolled out, we have heard stories of people being sent unfeasibly long distances just to get a test, but for this to be still happening at this stage is hugely disappointing.“Quick and easy access to testing are cornerstones of an effective test and trace system but once again the Tories seem unable to get the basics right.“They must solve these problems as a matter of urgency.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “NHS Test and Trace is working, it’s completely free and is stopping the spread of coronavirus.“Regional testing slots are allocated based on the nearest testing site with availability and we are working to ensure this takes into account journey times.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Racism in the TV industry has caused a “lost generation” of black talent who quit after suffering discrimination, David Olusoga has said. The broadcaster and historian told the Edinburgh TV Festival his past experiences of depression and wanting to leave television were similar to those of “many black and brown people” in the industry. Delivering the keynote James MacTaggart lecture at the online event, Olusoga described himself as a “survivor”, rather than a “success story”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe added: “I am one of the last men standing of TV’s lost generation. “The generation of black and brown people who entered this industry 15, 20, 25 years ago with high hopes. National Guard to be deployed in Kenosha after Jacob Blake shootingMo Gilligan to present documentary about black British comediansBiden condemns ‘systemic racism’ in shooting of unarmed black manMichael Jackson criticised The Beatles in unearthed notes on racismWhy we desperately need a new strategy to tackle structural racism“I’m a survivor of a culture within TV that failed that generation. “I’m here because a handful of people used their power and their privilege to help me.” Olusoga said that during his early years in television “there were parts of the industry in which ersity meant making sure that there was a fair balance of people from Oxford and Cambridge”. He added that it is “lonely” as a black person in the television industry. “Being the only black person on a production means being the only person asking certain questions, the only person uncomfortable that an image or a sequence reinforces certain stereotypes,” he said. “Like other black people I know in this industry, I’ve spent my career complaining that scripts or rough cuts contain interviews with white experts, while all the black contributors are victims of the phenomena in question are speaking about their personal experiences – their feelings not their expertise.” Olusoga said he had been labelled as “difficult” during his career.

Olusoga received widespread praise for his speech, with MP David Lammy thanking him for an “exemplary, masterly and sobering” lecture.Actress Rebecca Front urged people to read a transcript of his “profound, powerful and personal” words, while BBC Radio 1xtra DJ Mistajam tweeted: “As someone who has worked in television and also as someone who works in radio and has done for 15 years, every single word resonated.”Additional reporting by Press Association Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The conservatorship means that decisions about her lifestyle and finances are under the control of a court-appointed .Hilton, who was photographed partying with Spears throughout 2006, said that the star’s treatment is “not fair”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It breaks my heart that people have so much control over her,” Hilton told The Sunday Times. “It’s not fair to be an adult and be treated like a child. I can’t imagine having to live my life like that.”Hilton has consistently praised Spears in the years since they were last photographed together. She has not, however, maintained good feelings about Lindsay Lohan.Stephen Colbert casts Trump as Thanos in elaborate Avengers parodyBrendan Gleeson praised for ‘uncanny’ Trump transformationBruce Hornsby: ‘My entire class cheered when Kennedy was assassinated’In one notorious photograph from 2006, Hilton, Spears and Lohan were pictured squashed into the front seats of Hilton’s car, with The New York Post running the image on their front page the following day along with the headline “Bimbo Summit”.“She’s beyond,” Hilton said about Lohan. “I want nothing to do with her. Bad vibes.”Last week (21 August), a Los Angeles court decided that Spears’s conservatorship will remain in place until February 2021, with her father Jamie maintaining control over his daughter’s affairs.A fan movement known as #FreeBritney continues to reject the conservatorship and lobby for the star’s personal and professional freedom. In early August, Jamie Spears called the campaign “a joke” and said he is tired of speculation that his daughter is being exploited.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the updated version of the beloved cartoon, the titular superheroes will have grown up to become “disillusioned twentysomethings who resent having lost their childhood to crime fighting”.According to Deadline, Diablo Cody, who previously helmed films including Juno and Jennifer’s Body, will be teaming up with writer Heather Regnier – previously Sleepy Hollow and the recent Veronica Mars revival – on the reboot for The CW.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFans of the original, however, were quick to voice their scepticism when the news broke on Twitter.One user wrote in a post that has received nearly 11,500 likes: “No one and I mean absolutely no one has watched the powerpuff girls and thought ‘hmmm it would be even better as a live action series.’”Another said, “CW is actually making live action Powerpuff Girls and they’re going to be depressed adults? Can’t have s*** in 2020.” While a third referenced the show’s previous revival, stating, “Because if the failed reboot didn’t drive a nail into the franchise’s coffin, then maybe a dark, gritty live action series on the CW that nobody asked for will.”The original animated series, created by Craig McCracken, aired on Cartoon Network from 1998 to 2005. The show received a reboot in 2016 and ran new episodes up until last year. The Powerpuff Girls followed three pint-sized pink, blue and green superpowered sisters – Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup – as they fought off villains in the fictional city of Townsville. Although the synopsis for the live-action series sees the girls become jaded teenagers, it also hints there will still be plenty of crime-fighting too. “Will they agree to reunite now that the world needs them more than ever?”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Of Monday\u0027s new cases, 212 were found in the capital, 16 came from foreign arrivals and the rest from elsewhere in the country.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResidents of the densely populated capital area, home to roughly one-fifth of South Korea\u0027s population, have been advised to refrain from travelling to other cities as health officials say the country is at risk of a nationwide outbreak.This week will be critical for us to determine if we can contain the virus and flatten the curve going forwards, so we ask members of the public to participate in our quarantine measures, Yoon Tae-Ho, a senior official in South Korea\u0027s health ministry said at a briefing on Tuesday.The ‘shadow pandemic’ of domestic violence in Rohingya refugee campsResidents of Seoul have this week been ordered to wear masks in both indoor and outdoor public spaces for the first time, and high-risk venues including nightclubs, bars and churches have been ordered to close.On Tuesday, health minister Park Neung-hoo pleaded with thousands of doctors to return to work after mass walkouts in protest against a government proposal to increase the number of medical students by 4,000 over the next decade. The Korean Medical Association, which helped to organise the strike, says the country already has more than enough doctors.“We sincerely ask the medical staff to promptly return to the medical ground, where the patients are awaiting,” Mr Park said at a meeting.South Korea has reported a total of 17,945 cases so far in the coronavirus pandemic with 310 deaths.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The words are: Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves, Britons never never never shall be slaves.The song originates from the poem Rule, Britannia by James Thomson and was set to music by Thomas Arne in .The original poem consisted of six verses - all of six lines each.The song, however, performed at the Last Night Of The Proms, has been cut to just the first three verses with the refrain of Rule Britannia repeated.When Britain first, at Heavens commandArose from out the azure mainArose, arose from out the azure mainThis was the charter, the charter of the land,And  angels sang this strain:Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.The nations, not so blest as thee,Must, in their turns, to tyrants fallMust, in their turns, to tyrants fallWhile thou shalt flourish, shalt flourish great and free,The dread and envy of them all.Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.Still more majestic shalt thou rise,More dreadful, from each foreign strokeMore dreadful, dreadful from each foreign strokeAs the loud blast, the blast that tears the skies,Serves but to root thy native oak.Rule Britannia!

With matchless beauty crownd,And manly hearts to guard the fair.Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves:Britons never, never, never will be slaves.The patriotic song has caused a stir after the BBC considered dropping it from the Last Night Of The Proms. Rule Britannia has been called out for having links to colonialism and slavery in its lyrics - and in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, has been deemed controversial.The patriotic classic could be dropped from the BBC Proms - and because of Covid- restrictions, bosses have seen it as an opportunity to make the change. Prof Kehinde Andrews, from the School of Social Sciences at Birmingham City University, insisted both Rule Britannia and Land Of Hope And Glory should no longer be played due to their racist propaganda connotations.The academic said on Good Morning Britain: Ban is the wrong word, its not censorship.Its saying some songs, particularly those two, are racist propaganda which celebrates the British Empire which killed tens of millions people, many of which like myself are descendants of those victims of colonialism.Its totally inappropriate, its not about banning and censorship, its about saying what songs do we want to represent us.If, and its a big , we do want an anti-racist Britain then songs like these should not be celebrated in the proms.Rule, Britannia! was originally a poem, written by James Thomson, but was set to music in .The song is closely associated with the Royal Navy, and is also used by the British Army.It was written as Britains naval and political supremacy was slowly growing, following the beginning of constitutional monarchy in  - which contrasted with the strict royal absolutism of France at the time.The song contains lots of symbols of colonialism and racism - especially in the refrain: Rule, Britannia! rule the waves, Britons never will be slaves.Critics have said that saying Britons will never be slaves implies that its okay for others to be enslaved - which is what Brits were doing at the time of its composition in the th century.By the s, Britain was exporting half of the worlds slaves in the triangular trade, forming much of the base of the British Empire.At the time of the songs release, Liverpools slave ships made around  voyages a year, while Bristols ports averaged at . Slave ship owners and the owners of Caribbean plantations, most of who lived in Britain, became very wealthy and influential in government and society because of their exploits.The haughty tyrants lyric, which has also been blasted, references when Brits would invade foreign lands and call the native people tyrants - perpetuating the out-dated concept that Brits are superior to other races and people.British naval power was also equated to civil liberty - and the song assumed extra signicance in  at the end of World War II when it was played at the ceremonial surrender of the Japanese imperial army in Singapore.Classical music critic Richard Morrison said in a column for BBC Music Magazine last month: In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, it would surely be insensitive, bordering on the incendiary, to roar out these hypocritical th-century words, with or without irony.Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke!, an orchestra whose musicians are majority black, Asian and ethnically erse, criticised the song: It’s so irrelevant to today’s society.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They need to stop with this attempt to appease the woke morons.”The annual Royal Albert Hall concert, beamed around the world, traditionally ends with the flag-waving anthems.But organisers were said to be concerned about their links to the British Empire, and lyrics including: “Britons never will be slaves.” TV choirmaster Gareth Malone, told The Times that he supported removing Rule Britannia in solidarity with black and Irish members of his choirs who had refused to sing it in previous years.

But former Brexit Secretary David Davis has warned it is a critical endgame and the UK will soon have to be preparing for talks to collapse.He said Brussels will try to take things to the wire, adding: “The last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.” One Eurocrat admitted “outsiders don’t realise how pessimistic we’ve become” about getting a trade deal.The UK is holding firm on a refusal to accept EU red tape or cave in on fishing rights. Mr Barnier fears talks are headed for a bitter breakdown.He believes Downing Street is laying the ground for a vicious “blame game” over who is responsible for the stalemate.In a gloomy briefing to diplomats, the grumpy Frenchman claimed that last week’s tetchy round of talks have made things worse.The UK’s negotiator David Frost had put forward a draft text last week in the hope of speeding up the discussions. But Mr Barnier dismissed it as “unrealistic” and urged EU states to stay “cold blooded”.He insisted that the UK’s “clear strategy” will be to “trade off” fishing access for freedom from EU rules at the last minute.An EU source said: “We expect the mood to switch rapidly to contingency planning in expectation the UK will throw itself into the blame game rather than the endgame.”A British official hit back, saying: “The UK has consistently pushed for detailed textual discussions on the core elements of a trade agreement.“If the EU continues to stall progress because of its unrealistic asks on fish and subsidies, we will quickly run out of time.”WELL now I’ve seen everything. The gullible British Remainer Press report breathlessly that Michel Barnier is telling usthe Brexit negotiations are “running out of time”.Barnier is desperate to resolve his red line issues before we get to the critical endgame. I’ve always said the last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.But there will come a time very shortly when we will have to sht the thrust of our preparations towards No Deal. The reason for this is that the European Union always runs out the clock.When it is bullying some smaller state this works to its advantage. In the Brexit negotiation what will happen in the last few weeks is that the nation states of Europe will have to come to terms with the size of the risks that Barnier is taking.If we end up with a no deal scenario — and it is possible — the Europeans stand to lose a large and very profitable marketplace, namely the UK.It is clear that there are only two options now for leaving at the end of the transition period, a no deal exit or a zero-tarf deal. All sensible business owners will be preparing for both.Deferral and delay is the only thing that affects certainty. Certainty is what business and the country as a whole require.We already know there has been no “Great British Exodus” nor immediate recession — despite what certain pundits predicted.As long as we leave on time, there is no reason why this should change.Indeed,we deliver the certainty of the end of the transition period, there is every reason business and the economy will bounce back.It is incredible after all this time to see Brussels still bent on ensuring that Britain somehow loses out, so fixated are they on deterring others from ­abandoning their club.They are still making patently unreasonable power grabs even their europhile fans struggle to defend. They still want newly-independent Britain to surrender full control of our fishing waters. To agree economic restrictions to prevent us undercutting them and keep us under their thumb.They simply must change the recordthey’re genuinely worried about the potential hardship of us trading on WTO terms — and them copping the blame. No objective person will fault Britain for sticking to its guns on principles so fundamental.Michel Barnier won’t get his way. He and those pulling his strings seem strangely unable to digest that the Theresa May regime is gone, that voters threw out the Remainer Parliament and installed committed Brexiteers instead.We do agree with Barnier that negotiations seem dead in the water and a “no deal” looks nailed on.

Therefore, where possible, teachers need to show leniency. Social distancing rules also mean the idea of putting a child and teacher on their own for an hour in detention after school is a non-starter.“It is one change pupils will be cheering about — but it may leave teachers pulling their hair out.”Schools in England are under strict orders to put secondary school years into “bubbles” and not allow them to mingle with each other to reduce any risk of the spread of the virus.But ministers are taking a tougher tone with parents. They insisted school will again be “compulsory” from next week — and parents who refuse to send kids back face £ fines.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: “In terms of fining, we would ask all schools to work with those parents to encourage them to bring their children back and deal with any concerns they may have.“Fining would be very much the last resort — as it has always been.”He also said schools would be placed in local lockdown again only as a final course of action.  Normal sanctions must apply once schools go back, as even Labour agrees they must.

The Government moved fast with financial help for the millions whose incomes were hit by Covid-. The self-employed and furlough schemes were hugely welcomed and the £ per week uplt in Universal Credit made a huge dference to some hard up families, but others missed out on gaining from it because of the benefit cap – being unable to work because of the lockdown meant that they couldn’t earn enough to escape the cap. But besides the extension of free school meal replacements over the summer there was nothing specically for families with children – nothing that recognised the extra costs of raising kids. So, as our survey shows, hard-pressed parents found that while their incomes were shrinking, costs were rising. During lockdown children still needed meals and they carried on outgrowing clothes and shoes. Most were worse off and half were much worse off than before the pandemic. Debt and stress levels escalated. Sadly, some parents blamed themselves for not having enough money to meet their children’s needs. Butthe pandemic has revealed anything it’s that our social security net has become too threadbare after years of cuts and freezes. It’s no longer fit for the job of protecting us when times are tough.

The report, aposPoverty in the Pandemic: The impact of coronavirus on low-income families and childrenapos, is based on a survey of  hard-up households with kids eligible for free school meals, and  in-depth interviews. About eight of out  of those questioned admitted they were in a worse financial position than before the Covid- outbreak struck in March. Half were much worse off because their income plunged while costs climbed. Desperate parents told how they planned to sell jewellery so they could afford to let their kids carry on watching TV during the nationwide lockdown. Others admitted crying at night because they were mired in poverty while the country was shutdown. Nearly nine in  of those quizzed were spending substantially more than before on food, electricity, and other essentials because were stuck at home much more. Some % said the crisis hampered their ability to pay for food, % said it hit their ability to pay utility bills and % their ability to afford housing costs. Some % said it hampered their ability to pay for child-related costs such as nappies, baby products and children’s clothes. Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: “Low-income parents have been living under a cloud of anxiety in lockdown, trying to find money for family basics as their costs have been rising. “That’s taken a very heavy toll on the health and wellbeing of the worst-affected parents and children.” The majority of those questioned cited problems with the welfare system.They included benefit levels being too low to cover basic living costs, especially for those who had previously been working the long waiting period and additional delays in receiving the first Universal Credit payment, coupled with uncertainty in amounts received the impact of the benefit cap on families who had been furloughed at less than their full pay and dficulty in knowing where to look for advice on claiming benefits and other support.About two-thirds had been working before the pandemic or had a partner who had been working. Most of that group had either lost their job or seen a signicant drop in their earnings or income from self-employment, including furloughed workers on less than full pay. Experts fear rising levels of poverty as the Treasury begins to wind down the furlough scheme from next month. The authors of todayaposs -page report called on the Government to raise child benefit by £ a week and add an extra £ a week to the child element within Universal Credit and child tax credits, extend free school meals to all families who receive UC or Working Tax Credit, and scrap the benefit cap – or at least suspend it during the pandemic. Ms Garnham added: “As the Government’s Covid- emergency support schemes are tapered away in the coming months, more help will be needed for struggling families who have lost jobs or taken income drops. “Otherwise they will have only more hardship on their horizon.” At the height of the lockdown in April, demand for foodbank parcels rocketed. Centres in the Independent Food Aid Network reported a % increase in demand, while the UKaposs biggest food bank network, the Trussell Trust, reported an % rise. The Trussell Trustaposs director of policy and research Garry Lemon said last night: “We’ve seen more families needing help from foodbanks as the impact of coronavirus continues to hit people’s incomes. “This isn’t right. “The Government must ensure support is in place so people aren’t locked into poverty this winter, especially as projects like the furlough scheme are set to wind down in the coming months. “The rising need for foodbanks is not inevitable this can change.” Away from the financial impact inflicted by the pandemic, households also revealed added stress fuelled by the crisis. Nearly a quarter – % – experienced “relationship issues at home”, % suffered physical or mental health problems, and % took on extra caring responsibilities Bishop of Durham Paul Butler said: “In these unprecedented times, we all need to ask ourselves urgently how we can help our neighbour. “It is also imperative that the Government does all that it can to protect families and children by implementing the practical recommendations in this report. “We all must play our part.

The investigation came after Dame Margaret was said to have shouted at Mr Corbyn in a corridor, accusing him of racism and being antisemitic. A new book by journalists Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire claims the relationship fell apart because Mr McDonnell felt it was wrong to hold the probe.  The book says: “A question that preoccupied aides was whether McDonnell and Corbyn were comrades or personal friends first. “For a period that summer it was clear they were neither.” It said McDonnell “exploded” over the  investigation into Dame Margaret, a party member for more than  years. The book claims: “One senior aide said, ‘They never spoke for months. Never spoke the whole summer.’ The leader refused to contact the man to whom he had once been a lone friend in politics. By the end of the summer, neither was answering the other’s calls.”  The book quotes another Labour staffer saying: “They were walking past each other in the corridor and blanking each other – it was that level of not talking.” The book, serialised in The Times, says Mr Corbyn’s senior policy adviser Andrew Fisher was sent to Norfolk, where the Shadow Chancellor was on holiday on the Broads, to negotiate a settlement. It adds: “After a call with Corbyn and his aides, McDonnell agreed to bury the hatchet.” The book, ‘Left Out: The Inside Story of Labour Under Corbyn’, adds: “A question that troubled some was whether Corbyn categorised antisemitism as the kind of racism he set himself against.” "},{"url":null,"title":"schools covid 19 safe scientists","story":"NewsAre schools Covid- safe  Scientists advice explained as Boris Johnson demands The Prime Minister says theres a moral duty to send children back to school - but does re-opening classrooms pose a risk to students, teachers and family members  Heres what experts thinkShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsBoris Johnson wants all children back in school next month \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And ministers have warned parents they risk a finethey refuse to send their children back to school, as a last resort.But with the coronavirus still present and being transmitted in communities, is it safe for children toto schools Hereaposs a look at the safety and logistics of schools reopening. What have the experts said  The UKaposs chief medical officers have warned children are more at risk of long-term harmthey do not attend school thanthey . In a joint statement, the advisers said children have an exceptionally low risk of dying from the disease and very few,any children and teenagers would come to long-term harm from the virus solely by attending school.Should parents be fined for not sending their kids back to school  Tell us in the comments below And what is the latest scientic evidence   A study by Public Health England , published on Sunday, found there were  single confirmed cases, four co-primary casesand  outbreaks of Covid- in schools during June. It said the majority of cases linked to outbreaks were in staff, transmission between students was very rare, and where children did contract the virus, they were more likely to catch it at home, usually from a parent. Is there a risk to clinically extremely vulnerable pupils or parents  As the shielding programme for children and adults was paused on August , guidance says that pupils in this group canto school, as can those who have family members who are shielding. But,a local area sees a spike of Covid-, children or family members who live there will be advised to shield while rates remain high, and so may be temporarily absent from school. What about the risk of children coming home from school and infecting parents or grandparents   The Chief Medical Officers say international evidence suggests transmission from school-age children to parents or family members is rare. But they admit this evidence is weak. Teenagers, they say, may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children. And they say that because schools connect households, itaposs likely reopening them will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely. But the Chiefs say this is as much to do with aposindirectapos linking as it is a direct result of opening schools. That means some of the bump in transmission is likely to be from parents being able toto workplaces because schools are open, and from parents meeting up at the school gates. What measures are schools putting in place  The Government has set out a series of measures that all schools must follow, including good respiratory hygiene and enhanced cleaning procedures, such as hand sanitiser stations in classrooms. More regular hand-washing is advised and staff should ensure that children do so when they arrive at school,from their break, change rooms and after eating. Those who have symptoms of Covid-, or are in a household with someone displaying symptoms, should be kept away from the school. How dferent will the school day look for pupils  Staggering break and lunch times should be looked at and, ensuring that teaching time is maintained, schools should consider staggered start and finish times to keep groups apart as they arrive and leave school. When timetabling lessons, schools should ensure that dferent groups, or bubbles, are kept apart and movement around the school should be kept to a minimum. What are school bubbles and how will they work   As a way of minimising contact between students, and so reducing transmission of the disease, guidance recommends keeping groups of children separate in bubbles. Guidance suggests that in secondary schools the bubble is likely to be the size of a year group to enable staff to deliver the full range of curriculum subjects, while smaller group sizes may be implemented with younger children. Groups should be kept apart where possible, and older pupils should be encouraged to keep their distance from other children and teachers within the same group. But how will the groups be maintained  A headteachersapos union has warned that it will be enormously challenging for schools to keep children apart in year-group-sized bubbles. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: The logistics of keeping apart many dferent aposbubblesapos of children in a full school, including whole year groups comprising hundreds of pupils, is mind-boggling. Whatsomeone becomes unwell at school  If a pupil or a member of staff has symptoms of the virus, they should stay at home and arrange a test. In the case of a positive test, everyone within the school that had been in close contact with the pupil or staff member will be asked to self-isolate. A school will be said to have an outbreakthere are two or more confirmed cases within  days or an overall rise in absence where Covid- is suspected.

Aid the needy  Even before the virus hit, far too many households struggled to make ends meet. Their plight has been made even worse as a result of the lockdown. An important study by the Child Poverty Group and the Church of England shows Britain’s poorest families have been left without the money to pay for food and utility bills. They are backing the Mirror’s call for an immediate increase in child benefit and the scrapping of the benefit cap. The Government has a warped sense of priorities when it is subsiding the wealthy to eat out but doing nothing to help the poorest. Raising child benefit by £ a week would lt at least , children out of poverty. If Boris Johnson is genuine about his wish to “level up” he would take this step now.

A poll of , adults found that despite  per cent claiming to be foodies, one in five donapost think it is possible to have good fats in food. And  per cent believe all high calorie foods are bad for you. More than one in  consider margarine or a sports drink to be healthier than nuts while a fth think potatoes or crisps are better for you than salmon. A spokesman from Morphy Richards, the creator of the Intellisteam, which commissioned the research, said: The results of this study provide an interesting insight into what people know about food - and how they cook it. Itaposs not always easy to tell the dference between good and bad foods, and it can be easy to fall for common misconceptions. But there is a clearer understanding when it comes to the method of cooking, with steaming correctly being named as the healthiest option. Convenience is definitely something people enjoy when creating dishes - but itaposs all about finding the balance between having a delicious meal and a healthy one - they can be both. The study also revealed respondents fared a little better when it came to cooking methods, with  per cent correctly saying steaming is the healthiest way to cook a meal - something  per cent often choose to do. Seven in  were also aware about the benefits of sealing flavour and preserving nutrients of food when steaming.  It also emerged more than three in  respondents enjoy convenience when cooking, with Brits averaging two ready meals a week. Although  per cent admitted they should know more about the food they consume. As a result,  per cent would love to learn more about how to make nutritional meals and  per cent see it as aposextremely importantapos to eat balanced dishes. But nearly nine in  have been left frustrated after trying to get numerous components of a meal to be ready to serve at the same time - with  per cent experiencing this weekly. Despite this, the average adult is cooking meals from scratch four nights a week - and consider these to be balanced meals.

Andrew Mitchell, the new co-chair of a  looking into whether the rules should change, has said that MPs are beginning to back the idea.

He told Sky: “We need to make clear that we are not looking here for a massive change.

On the groups website it says: Dying people are not suicidal – they don’t want to die but they do not have the choice to live. When death is inevitable, suffering should not be. Along with good care, dying people deserve the choice to control the timing and manner of their death.  The topic was brought into Parliament in  when a bill calling for some terminally ill adults to have the choice to opt for euthanasia was tabled. In a free vote in the Commons,  MPs were in favour and  against the plans. Under those proposals people with fewer than six months to live could have been prescribed a lethal dose of drugs, which they had to be able to take themselves. Two doctors and a High Court judge would have needed to approve each case. At the time of the vote Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, explained why he was happy that it was rejected. He told the BBC: It protects those who have no voice against exploitation and coercion, it acts as a powerful deterrent to would-be abusers and does not need changing. Do you support legalising assisted dying  Let us know in the comments below. Mr Mitchell moved to soothe fears that assisted dying legislation would lead rogue actors to end otheraposs lives against their will. He said: “People who fear the thin end of the wedge, slippery slope argument can be reassured and they can be reassured on this count: that once Parliament passes a very limited law, they would have to go back to Parliament to get that law changed. In the past people calling for the right to end their lives with the help of a medical professional have taken their cause as far as the High Court.The most recent was Phil Newby, from Rutland in East Midlands, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at just -years-old, the Daily Star reported."},{"url":null,"title":"big fat gypsy wedding stars","story":"NewsBig Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Dohertys son left with bleed on brain after muggingPaddy Doherty claims his son was beaten up for his watch and ring in a mugging in Anglesey, Wales, and telephoned him telling him he thought he was going to dieShareCommentsBySarah HodgsonDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsPaddy Doherty said he thanks God that his son survived the incident \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The brekkie-on-wheels service will be tested when childrento school in England next week in a bid to keep them in their class bubbles. According to a Kellogg’s survey of teachers, making sure children don’t start the school day on an empty tummy is one of the biggest challenges of the school day in the socially distanced new normal. Teachers say that serving breakfast at desks is the best solution as opting for staggered start times will mean making the meal available from -am which is unworkable. The trollies from Kellogg’s are part of a pilot scheme in around  schools and the food wagons will be loaded with hot and cold grub like toast, cereal and fruit as well as goodies from breakfast club partner Greggs. They will trundle along corridors and stop at classrooms to dish out food from .am so parents can drop the kids and go to work.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereGrab bags will also be tested in a separate scheme as teachers say parents are already askingbreakfast clubs will be available when the new school year starts. Kate Prince, corporate social responsibility manager at Kellogg’s said: “Trollies have been adapted to include a hot plate so children have the option of a hot or cold breakfast andit’s successful then we may extend the scheme to other schools. “We’re also looking at breakfast bags with fruit, cereal boxes and cereal bars which can be distributed easily.” School breakfast clubs are a big concern with almost nine in  teachers believingthey are axed it will have an adverse impact on children. The survey of  teachers found two thirds felt breakfast clubs will be needed more than ever as kids head back for the first time since lockdown.  One teacher said: “Some children will not have any breakfast at all meaning they will be hungry all day until lunchtime. “This will cause loss of concentration and behavioural issues.” Another added: “Some children need our breakfast club to get them started and in the right mind-set for learning.” Kellogg’s set up its breakfast club programme in  and to date has donated £ million in grants to schools to help provide morning meals for kids. Another survey of  teachers by charity Magic Breakfast which also provides food for schools, found almost six in  teachers felt there would be more kids arriving hungry for lessons this term compared with September last year.

The fast food chain axed its -year-old catchphrase amid concerns it “doesn’t quite fit in the current environment”. It has released images of new advertising posters with the two world famous key words blurred out leaving just “it’s good” visible. KFC said it was a temporary suspension as the message did not suit the hygiene message in the new normal. But bosses vowed the phrase would make a comeback “when the time is right”. KFC admitted it had set itself a major headache trying to find a substitute slogan more than six decades after “it’s finger lickin’ good” was enough to identy its fried chicken pieces. Kate Wall, head of advertising at KFC UK said: “People often say that it’s the second movie that’s hardest to get right. The follow-up, the next step. And we are facing the same conundrum at the moment. “How do you follow a slogan that’s lasted for  years and is as iconic as ours  “Well, we know we can do it with a little help from our friends. And you’ll be hearing more from us on this soon.” Unveiling the new look ads with “finger” and “lickin’” pixelated in a YouTube video, KFC told viewers: “That thing we all say  Ignore it. For now.” Catherine Tan-Gillespie, global chief marketing officer at KFC said: “We find ourselves in a unique situation - having an iconic slogan that doesn’t quite fit in the current environment.  “While we are pausing the use of ‘It’s Finger Lickin’ Good’, rest assured the food craved by so many people around the world isn’t changing one bit.” The fast food chain which has more than  restaurants across the UK and Ireland and employs , staff recently fell foul of public opinion after its “finger lickin’ good” ads in late February showed diners greedily licking their hands after a meal.

Nathan Gorman was jailed after he called Judge Hilary Manley a aposf****** s**gapos and a aposf****** bi***apos.The -year-old also became violent towards two dock officers, Manchester Evening News reported. Gorman, from Longsight, admitted being in contempt of court and has now been jailed for three months. The incident unfolded when he appeared at Manchester Crown Court for a hearing on August . The defendant launched a volley of aposviciousapos and aposmisogynisticapos abuse towards the female judge when she decided to remand Gorman - who had been on bail - in custody. Following the incident he was kept behind bars before appearing at Minshull Street Crown Court before the same judge. Gorman apologised and admitted being in contempt of court, saying aposI admit thatapos after the details of the charge were read to him. In mitigation, his lawyer Milena Bennett said Gorman, of Richmond Grove, Longsight, had expected to be granted bail again. Ms Bennett said: He wishes to apologise unreservedly to the court for his unwarranted outburst. He reacted extremely inappropriately. Describing Gorman as an aposexcitableapos inidual, Ms Bennett added: He quite evidently lacks consequential thinking skills. This may go some way to explain his behaviour that day. Judge Manley said she accepted that there are sometimes courtroom outbursts because people are at a stressful point in their lives.

Mercy Baguma, from Uganda, was found dead by police on Saturday August  after friends raised the alarm when she had not heard from since Tuesday.The baby boy was rushed to hospital for treatment but was released yesterday, reports GlasgowLive.The child’s father is caring for him and resides where in the city. Mercy - who was an asylum seeker - lost her job after her limited leave to remain had reportedly expired leaving her unable to work. Mercy, in her thirties, was reportedly relying on food from friends and charitable organisations. Robina Qureshi, Director of Positive Action in Housing said: “This is the third tragedy to affect the city’s refugee population in as many months. Mercy contacted our charity on August  and said she was not getting any financial support yet had made an application to MigrantHelp. Had she lived she would have been a high priority for a crisis payment from our Emergency Relief Fund like hundreds of others left ally destitute by the asylum system. “The question remains, why are mothers and babies being left to go hungry in this city, why is it being left to charities and volunteers to pick up the pieces  Does society have anything to say about that other than call them a drain on society  The fact is there is no safety netyouaposre a refugee or migrant. You are left destitute and without resources. And youaposre left silenced by far right rhetoric for being forced to ask for help. Would this mother be aliveshe was not forced out of her job by this cruel system that stops you from working and paying your way because a piece of paper says your leave to remain has expired  I’m sure Mercy’s son will want to ask this and other questions once he is old enough.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

On August  elaborate celebrations will be held to mark the anniversary of Kim Jong-il founding of Songun. Songun is a political ideological unique to North Korea that claims all problems in society can be corrected by giving priority to military affairs Ahead of the event the North Korean government released a film containing images of current leader Kim, his birth mother Ko Yong-hui and his we Ri Sul-ju.The  minute video shows Ko Yong-hui in Osandeok City in the North Hamgyeong Province - the hometown of Kim Jong-il, Daily NK reported.The film later shows Kim as a child, reading, making art and planting trees together with his mum. In North Korea Kimaposs mother is only referred to by titles, such as The Respected Mother who is the Most Faithful and Loyal aposSubjectapos to the Dear Leader Comrade Supreme Commander. The circumstances surround her death are unclear.On  August , ious sources reported that she had died in Paris from unspecic illness, probably of breast cancer.Other reports claims that she was treated in Paris in the spring of  and then flown back to Pyongyang where she fell into a coma and died in August that year.The previous regime attempted to build a cult of personality around Ko prior to Kimaposs ascent to power.Such moves have been frustrated by her lowly origins, as considered by North Koreaaposs songbun class system. Not only did Koaposs Korean-Japanese heritage make her part of the lowest hostile class, her fatheraposs work in a Japanese army sewing factory rendered her the low of the low in North Korean eyes. Kim is said to be fearful that public knowledge of details of his motheraposs upbringing would undermine his familyaposs pure bloodline. As a consequence Koaposs name became an official state secret after Kim Jong-il died in . She is now referred to by her nicknames. It was reported earlier today that rumours about Kimaposs health are circulating again.  Whispers that he could be dead started again after a South Korean diplomat sensationally claimed the North Korean leader is in a coma. Chang Song-min, a former aide to South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung, didnapost provide any evidence to back up his claim - the same one he made months ago only for Kim to be pictured in public days later.

The Queen and Prince Philip will spend the next few months at their ,-acre Scottish estate and their relatives and in-laws will come and stay at dferent points.According to her granddaughter Princess Eugenie, the stunning castle is where the Monarch is the most happy, and she loves spending time with her children and their familes. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their kids George, Charlotte and Louis, Prince Charles, Camilla, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry and the York sisters all pop in to stay with the Queen and Philip during their holidays - making it a very busy time for them.But what exactly do the royals get up to during their Scottish break  Due to social distancing, relatives will stay at separate accommodation rather than sleeping in the Castle itself. However the majority of their normal holiday activities take place outdoors anyway, so they wonapost have to make many changes to ensure everyone is safe. Speaking on ITVaposs documentary Our Queen at , Eugenie, who was spotted arriving at the Castle last week, talked about previous trips to Balmoral.  She said: Itaposs the most beautul place on earth. I think Granny is the most happy there, I think she really, really loves the Highlands…walks, picnics, dogs, a lot of dogs, thereaposs always dogs, and people coming in and out all the time. Family-wise weaposre all there, so itaposs a lovely base for Granny and Grandpa to be - for us to come and see them up there where you just have room to breathe and run. But according to an insider, itaposs not almost the most relaxing break and things can be pretty hectic.  They told Vanity Fair: “It can get quite busy at what they call ‘the big house’ and it’s not especially relaxing even though it’s a holiday. “There’s a daily routine which evolves around meal times, several outfit changes every day, sometimes five, and the Queen likes everything to run like clockwork. The focus is on being outdoors and in the countryside walking, grousing, fishing and hunting.” Balmoral is a working estate with highlights including grouse moors, the lush green forests and farmland, as well as plenty of animals from the herds of deer to Highland cattle and ponies.  The Royals love grouse hunting, and go out regularly during their time at the castle. Prince Charles, William, Harry and Kate have all been known to go out shooting over the summer months, and last year they even took little George along to watch.However, they were forced to call off the whole grouse shooting season last year as there was a drop in the number of the birds in the area due to insects and bad  weather. Photographer Milton Gendel said he was invited to Balmoral back in  , and opened up about the experience to  Vanity Fair  .He wrote: On some days there were excursions into the country. The Queen had been taught to drive by auxiliary army officers during World War II, and she handled a Land Rover with intrepid skill on the hilly and winding roads. When we went riding, she saddled her horse, and afterward carried the saddle back to the stable herself.  At a shoot on the grounds a truck delivered a sumptuous buffet lunch. The aposgunsapos lay on the grass for a postprandial respite. The Queen and her sister walked about, deep in conversation. They were very close when apart, they telephoned two or three times a day. The atmosphere was always agreeable, buoyed by the light touch of the Queen and her sister.

The Yorkshire born artist arrived in St Ives on  August , just days before the breakout of the Second World War. She lived and worked there for the rest of her le, helping the small seaside town establish itself on the avant-garde of Britainaposs art scene. Hepworth found the Cornish coastline to be a constant source of inspiration, and she became an internationally renowned sculptor - one of the few female English artists of her generation to achieve global prominence. She was a close friendof Henry Moore, and she co-founded the Penwith Society of Arts with her then-husband Ben Nicholson. Hepworth challenged the notion that mothers could not also cultivate successful careers. She had a son, Paul, from her first marriage, and triplets, Rachel, Sarah and Simon, with her second husband. She once argued: A woman artist is not deprived by cooking and having children, nor by nursing children with measles  – one is in fact nourished by this rich le, provided one always does some work each day even a single half hour, so that the images grow in oneaposs mind.

Lexi, from Indiana in the US, spends her days at home playing with toys, sleeping, watching cartoons and drinking milk. Her boyfriend, who she calls aposDaddyapos, makes her food, reads her stories, puts her to bed and even changes her nappies every day. However, they donapost have a sexual relationship - and heaposs not allowed to sleep with other women. Lexi is now lting the lid on le in an adult-baby relationship and breaking taboos on what is more commonly seen as a deviant lestyle - and say there is nothing sexual about it. Lexi said: Itaposs about ing to innocence and to a time before negative things happened to me, itaposs like a coping mechanism. I spend my days wearing nappies  , I have my morning change as soon as I wake up, then he [her boyfriend] feeds me my bottle and then I watch cartoons and play with toys - I live exactly like a child. Iaposm not just roleplaying, I live asI am a baby, and thataposs what I aspire to do for the rest of my le because when I found out that living like this could happen, I wanted it right away. My boyfriend is very supportive, I told him about it as soon as we met on a dating site. Itaposs a part of my le and he needed to be up for ithe wanted to date me. He was immediately accepting and has been my caregiver for over a year, he cares for me like a parent would care for a child.  He feeds me my bottles, gives me a bath and changes my nappyit is a wee, not the other kind. He was really open to changing me, he took it for it was and itaposs been progressive ever since, heaposs still getting his mind around it. I consider myself to be a stay-at-home baby, and throughout the day I do change myself, but heaposll always do it at night, cooks for me, packs my lunch for when heaposs away, tickles me and he lives our lestyle to the fullest. The one thing we donapost have is a sexual relationship, we are exclusively together so he canapost sleep with other people, but I also canapost sleep with him and heaposs okay with that. I did not force him into celibacy, that was a decision we made as a couple regardless of our lestyle. I donapost force this le on anyone, we just donapost want people to believe that itaposs deviant because itaposs not about sex, itaposs a commitment to each other.  I do have a fully ing adult brain, and when he does need to speak to an adult then I can switch off for him. We donapost expect everyone to accept it or understand it but it works for us and weaposre happy, Iaposm very thankful for him. People think that itaposs a sexual relationship and weaposre attracted to children but that just isnapost true. In any society there are bad eggs and we actively discourage contact with anyone who is attracted to children. The couple now plan to live like this forever and arenapost afraid of what people may think. Lexi added: Questions are healthy, I would much rather ask me about how I live than talk about it behind my back. I have let go of what other people think of me.  While it is not sexual for me and my relationship, it is sexual for many and that is something that I consider okay for people who do want to live in that way, it is just not the way for me, as this lestyle is about innocence and authenticity in the way I live. The association with predators is something upsetting to myself and also many others in this lestyle but taboo or dferent doesnapost equal wrong. Iaposve always been childish, and choose to express and live that way while retaining adult ality but I often feel my outside does not match who I am on the inside I do not want people to feel or believe that I believe I am an infant.

The scientists say the case illustrates that reinfection can occur a few months after recovery from the first infection. The findings indicate the disease, which has killed more than , people worldwide, will continue to spread among the global population despite herd immunity, they said. The -year-old male was cleared of Covid- and discharged from a hospital in April, but tested positive again after ing from Spain via the UK on August . The patient had appeared to be previously healthy, researchers said in the paper, which was accepted by the international medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. He was found to have contracted a dferent coronavirus strain from the one he had previously contracted and remained asymptomatic for the second infection. The finding does not mean taking vaccines will be useless, Dr Kai-Wang To, one of the leading authors of the paper, told Reuters.  Immunity induced by vaccination can be dferent from those induced by natural infection, To said. [We] will need to wait for the results of the vaccine trials to seehow effective vaccines are. World Health Organisationepidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said today that there was no need to jump to any conclusions in response to the Hong Kong case. Instances of people discharged from hospitals and testing positive again for Covid- infection have been reported in mainland China. However, in those cases it was not clear whether they had contracted the virus again after full recovery - as happened to the Hong Kong patient - or still had the virus in their body from the initial infection. The preliminary number of patients in China who tested positive again once being discharged from hospital was %-%, Wang Guiqiang, an infectious disease specialist in Chinaaposs expert group for COVID- treatment, said during a press briefing in May.

And he predicts Jong-Unaposs younger sister will prove to be a cruel dictator.“The way for her to build up her credibility and net worth, that is, the way for her to get respect, is not to play nice but be a cruel dictator to her people and a credible nuclear threat to the US,” he told the New York Post.“She may prove herself fiercer and more tyrannical than her brother, father, or grandfather.” He saidYo-Jong does take power, she will need to be ruthless, particularly in the early years of her reign. Retired US Army Colonel David Maxwell agreed with Mr Leeaposs assertion. Col Maxwell helped devise the Pentagon’s  contingency plan with South Korea for the collapse of the North’s regime.  “I haven’t seen any evidence, any indication of how she might rule, but my speculation — given the reputation and history of the family — is that she would rule with an iron fist,” Col Maxwell said. Jong-Un was expected to be more open with the outside world when he succeeded his father Kim Jong II in . While that has not proved the case, his sister is expected to take a more abrasive stance. If she takes charge, her reign would likely be heralded by missile launches as a show of strength, according to Victor Cha, who was a director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council during the administration of former President George W. Bush.  He also predicted she would instigate a purge of government figures in order to install people loyal to herself, and would be a hard-liner with South Korea and the US. Reports that Jong-Un was in a coma circulated earlier this week, while rumours also surfaced that the North Korean leader may have died, having been seen in public only a handful of times this year. Chang Song-min, a former aide to South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung, insisted Jing-Un was still alive, telling reporters: “I assess him to be in a coma, but his le has not ended.

Linda Armstrongaposs daughter told Tarrant at his sentencing hearing that he was nothing and said like herself, he would never again feel the love and warmth of his motheraposs hug. Devastated Angela Armstrong urged him to use his le term in prison to consider the beauty in ersity he had sought to destroy when he killed  people, in a shooting rampage in Christchurch last year. Sobbing in court in Christchurch on the second day of the four day sentencing hearing, Ms Armstrong told -year-old Australian Tarrant: You robbed me of my mother, of her love and strength.Likely you will also never again feel the love and warmth of your motheraposs hug either.While I have pity for your mum, I have no emotion for you, she added. You are nothing. While he will remain trapped in a cage my mum is free. I therefore challenge Tarrant to use his remaining letime to consider the beauty and le to be found in ersity and freedom that he sought to distort and destroy.Tarrant is scheduled to be sentenced this week after pleading guilty to  murders,  attempted murders and one charge of committing a terrorist act.A murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of le in prison.The judge can impose a le term without parole, a sentence that has never been used in New Zealand. The second day in court was dedicated to allowing survivors and family members of victims to address the court, in person and via video.Tarrant sat in grey prison clothes cornered by guards as Ms Armstrong looked at him and described the ripple effects of the murder of her -year-old mother on her family.Kyron Gosse, nephew of Linda Armstrong, said the gunman had come to New Zealand as a guest, and used that privilege to destroy a family that had lived in the country for seven generations.I want you to understand my utter rage when I learnt this man was a guest to New Zealand, said Mr Gosse.He entered into our home with ill intentions and hate in his heart, only to repay our hospitality by murdering our family and our guests, people who we welcome into this country with the promise of a better le.He stole that safety and security from them, just as he stole our nationaposs innocence. Filled with his own racist agenda this coward hid behind his big powerful guns and shot little old Linda from afar. New Zealand had been relatively free from major gun violence until the countryaposs worst mass shooting. On Monday, prosecutors told the court Tarrant had carefully planned the attacks to cause maximum carnage by accumulating high-powered firearms and ammunition, training at rle clubs and studying mosque layouts.While most of Tarrantaposs victims were at Al Noor mosque, he killed seven people at the Linwood mosque, including Linda Armstrong, a convert to Islam.He was detained en route to a third mosque.Ambreen Naeem lost her husband Naeem Rashid and son Talha Naeem in the shootings.

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Wait ages for one and suddenly three turn up at once.The three were also available for yesterday#s home victory against Livingston.Just  hours after completing a loan move from Bristol City, attacker Marley Watkins was thrown in at the deep end leading the line.Striker Bruce Anderson, unavailable for the Perth clash, was also back.Then there was a further boost just minutes before kick-off, with Curtis Main added to the squad when Craig Bryson felt his calf in the warm-up.Main had been out since knee surgery in the summer and also suffered a thigh strain during his rehabilitation.His appearance off the bench against Liv surely gives McInnes the option of going with two up top against NSI Runavik.New signing Marley Watkins was thrown straight into the action at Pittodrie just  hours after completing his loan move from Bristol City.Welsh international Watkins # who can also be played out wide # has had just  minutes of action since January, but he looked sharp and fast while leading the attack.On the basis of this debut, he can deliver goals and assists for Aberdeen. He was only denied a debut goal yesterday because of a brilliant double block from Livi keeper Robbie McCrorie.The stopper is the twin brother of Reds midfielder-defender Ross McCrorie.Aberdeen’s last appearance at Pittodrie was initially a cause for celebration as football ed to the stadium for the first time in more than five months due to the Covid- pandemic.It quickly turned sour with a turgid performance in a - loss to Rangers followed by the actions of the Aberdeen eight in attending a busy city centre bar on the night of that defeat.That plunged the Reds’ season into early chaos, but with two straight wins # away at St Johnstone and at home against Livi # they are getting it back on track, although there could be a further setback with the SFA serving notices of complaint to the eight players.They could be hit with bans of between two to eight games at Friday’s principle hearing.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#.

My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

In the courtyard, Saoirse Amira Anisrsquo ldquoWe can still dance, a powerful work commissioned as part of the Black Lives Matter Scottish Mural Trail.ldquoThe exhibition would have been markedly dferent, more institutional perhaps,the lockdown hadnrsquot happened, says curator Claire Feeley. Liversidge had been going to concentrate on Brexit, but Covid changed that.And yet it has all come together remarkably well, and a testament to the unique working conditions in which the artists found themselves in these last few months.Feeley tells me that Kaprow taught throughout his career, ldquoand most of what we consider his artworks were mainly done with students. The main thing he was interested in was giving a simple set of instructions, which could remain as ideas or proposals, and seem at face value simple and succinct, but then the real world hits, and when people try to follow his instructions, the problems of organisation are part of the piece. The only people who experience the happenings are the people making them themselves!Kaprow had been allowing other artists to reinvent his work since relatively early in his career, and these are the latest reincarnations.The first artwork greets you at the entrance gate, or more accurately smothers it, a barrage of Thank Yous painted by Wilsons during lockdown at the behest of Peter Liversidge. Liversidge has reworked Allan Kaprowrsquos Out Exit piece, originally created by Kaprow for Edinburgh in . The signs, brightly painted, make the entrance look like a maximised incarnation of the thank yous and rainbows placed in windows around the country over the last few months. The Wilsons have also recreated the artistrsquos Yard , blocking off their own driveway with a wall of used tyres.Liversidge, with his ldquoProposals, many of which are never carried out, is a fine fit for Kaprow, who suggested lsquohappeningsrsquo in similar vein. His ideas were off-centre, humorous, an interruption of daily le, call it what you will. In the Steadings gallery, the upper level has been cordoned off for a sign painter in Liversidgersquos reinvention of Kaprowrsquos only UK happening. There is a book provided, from which you can pick a legend to be painted on a cardboard sign to take away ndash a donation is suggested.The phrases are all taken from the words of students from around the country, part of Jupiterrsquos Youth Council, whom Liversidge spoke with prior to and during lockdown, to listen to their thoughts and concerns. From ldquoDoes the hawk see us too  to ldquoThe sound of the wind in the pines, each phrase a skein of a le that thought it during lockdown, a human concern, packed in amongst many.Upstairs in the Tin Roof Gallery, Cinzia Mutigli has created a piece that takes its inspiration from Sweet Wall, Kaprowrsquos  ldquopolitical parody, as he called it, in which he built a concrete wall, joined together with slabs of bread and jam, on a piece of wasteland near the Berlin Wall.Mutiglirsquos work, which comes closest, as Feeley points out, to fulfilling the idea of a reinvention, deals in sugar and postcolonial identity, the film an overload of words and ideas and patterns repeated over and over, sledgehammer-like, as the viewer sits and watches in the repeat-pattern wallpapered room, whilst munching Mutiglirsquos homemade jam sandwiches.Itrsquos an overwhelming piece, and one which is very personal, in that lockdown has made this film largely of the artist, the narrative a mix of personal experience and ldquoexpert analysis, each filtering in and out of comprehensibility.In the Ballroom Gallery, James Hoff, based in New York, has used a short recording made by Kaprow on how to make a happening, broadcast it to a number of radios and made up thousands of copies of original posters Kaprow made to advertise his happenings, for visitors to take away free.They are also available in art bookshops across Scotlandfor those who cannot travel to Jupiter.

There is the work of RBGE taxonomist Dr Peter Wilkie, on natural plastic from the tropical tree family, Sapotaceae, and Carla Edwardsrsquo Miscellany, a series of forms made from gutta percha, an early ldquonatural plastic. Lorna Wilsonrsquos beautul Lichen Wallis an homage to clean air lichens made ndash ironically and deliberately ndash from recycled fridges, whilst Carol Sinclairrsquos floating mobile, made from dferent plastics, is an investigation into the use and reuse of recyclable plastics. There are also ldquogreen plastics created by the University of Edinburgh ndash a nascent area of research ndash used by artists in the exhibition.What emerges, amongst many things, is that plastic is more valuable than our throwaway culture deems it, but onlyit is seen as a reuseable resource . The paradox of the whole is seen in Lorna Fraserrsquos Parasol Fungi, pictured, glass-like, made from recycled water bottles, which reflect that same air of beauty and menace found in the curious forms of nature, and in the nature of the manmade material which has been used to create these strange, delicate forms.Think Plastic: Materials and Making, Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh, John Hope Gateway, Arboretum Place, Edinburgh,   , www.rbge.org.uk Until  Nov, Daily, am-pmDONT MISSCreated entirely during lockdown, An Lanntairrsquos inspired Sketchbook Project has been created with  of the islandrsquos residents, all of whom were sent a sketchbook by the gallery, with daily email prompts for drawing.

Signicant proposed changes include enabling the children involved to express their views and changing the way these views are obtained.But unless an amendment from Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur is agreed in tomorrows debate, a key opportunity will be missed to improve the chances that children will remain equally involved with both of their parents. The vast majority of research around the world concludes that equal time or close to it has enduring benefits for the children in separated families.Mr McArthurrsquos amendment introduces a factor into court hearings that has already been successful in other progressive countries. On the request of one of the parents, the sherf hearing a court case will have to consider whether children should spend approximately equal time with each of their parents.The amendment doesnrsquot force the court to order shared care. It doesnrsquot bind the hands of a sherf or undermine the overweening principle that the sherf will put the interests of the children first. It does mean thatthere are two safe, competent, loving parents both will have the opportunity to make their case for sharing the parenting responsibilities. It creates a dferent starting point for the decision from the winner-takes-all competition we currently have in Scotland.A similar law has been in force in Belgium since . It has reduced the number of such disputes that have to be brought to court. According to Belgian family judge Marie-France Carlier, ldquothere has been a huge reduction of parental conflict in the courts as parents now know what the law says. After separation, lots of them immediately decide to set up joint physical custody before having any court decision. A change in culture has gone hand in hand with a change in the law.Only about  per cent of Belgian decisions are for a : split with around % of remaining decisions for semi-equal care, with the children spending at least five days per fortnight with one parent.Usually it is the father who ends up with less time, but this still means he can be fully involved in weekday care ndash not relegated to the visiting role of a ldquoweekend dad. If the court considers that children will not benefit from full involvement of both parents it can order whatever contact pattern is best for them.Underpinning Mr McArthurrsquos amendment is an acceptance that the current system is expensive, unpredictable and inconsistent between courts and between sherfs. It has too many disincentives to cooperation between parents at a time when they need help to make things as easy as possible for their children, not a system that encourages them to criticise each other to win time with their kids.We have heard sherfs say from the bench ndash even before hearing arguments ndash that shared parenting never works. Of course sherfs also know they never see the successes. Only the failures come back before them.Politicians in countries such as Portugal, Greece and Brazil are currently considering whether to make similar changes in their family law. Holyrood could strike a blow for parental equality this week and bring the law into line with the reality of family le in modern Scotland.Ian Maxwell is the national manager of the Shared Parenting Scotland charity"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-ann-fotheringham---call-like-long-not-generation-covid","story":"That end-of-the-day chatter, a jumble of who-said-what-and-what-happened-when, has been absent from our lives since lockdown began, and I have missed it very much.It was dferent from the usual first-day-back-blether, of course ndash they had five months of catching-up to do, five months of missed chat and daftness with their friends, five months starved of all the things tweens and teens should have in their lives.They had whole new regimes to get their heads around, from handwashing and one-way systems to split timetables and lunchbreaks which seemed, for the teachers at any rate, to last about four hours.There is no doubt the last few months have been dficult for children without the structure and support of school, some young people in tough circumstances have floundered.

I donrsquot blame her for jumping at the chance to place the SNP firmly in front of the nation by leading these sessions and it is plain for all to see that she enjoys basking in the limelight. We all need to be briefed on developments in respect of Covid- but a short bulletin a couple of times per week would suffice.Nevertheless it has taken  years for the SNP fortunes to reach the point where independence could be imminent and it is high time for the Unionists to wake up and become more vocal before the May Holyrood elections precipitate a landslide into oblivion.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.UK press and media cite Business for Scotland Panelbase and Times YouGov August  poll figures respectively of  per cent and % support for Scottish independence. These figures exclude Donrsquot Knows and are partial, inflated \"headline figures\" that provide a basis for misleading reporting.Actual Panelbase and YouGov poll figures respectively show For % and %, Against % and %, Donrsquot Knows % and % . These produce simple averages of For .%, Against .%, Donrsquot Knows %.Support for independence has been rising over , is clearly higher than for remaining within the UK and lies around % . However, whether or not there is majority support for independence is not proven and there has not yet been sustained majority support over a period of time demonstrated for independence. There is therefore no convincing opinion poll case at present to support a second independence referendum. Nor has there been any reversal of the  Referendum   result, contrary to the misleading statement by Business for Scotland .Use of actual poll figures including Donrsquot Knows at the \"headline level\" are essential for objective use of statistics and balance of reporting.Whether or not the Panelbase poll of a % majority for independence continues to be reflected across dferent polls and strengthens over a sustained period of time is an issue, though so also is what happens to the Donrsquot Knows.The level of support for Scotland remaining within the UK has fallen signicantly since  at currently .% , a reflection of Scottish views on Brexit and Conservative governments since  the success of the SNP and First Minister on public perceptions of performance and confusion over UK and Scottish government responsibilities.Dont Knows might well be expected though to vote for the status quo given financial uncertainties and risks. YouGov states \"polling has shown % think the country would be worse off economicallyindependent, compared to % who think better off\". Adding together the above averaged Against and Dont Knows would produce a . .% result against Scottish independence. This is an uncertain proposition that could only be tested in a referendum, but is as much a reasonable proposition for consideration and debate as using partial inflated   and   figures that exclude Donrsquot Knows.John Garrity, Chichester.PETER A Russells concern for Alex Salmond and Scotlands justice systemhas a hollow ring to it, but I agree thatthere was a plot to have Mr Salmond thrown into jail for crimes he did not commit, it is certainly a most serious matter. Surely,anyone has evidence of such a thing the correct procedure would be to immediately contact the police, as the withholding of evidence is also a serious crime.However, I strongly suspect that, in the first place, there is no evidence because there was no plot, and in the second place, that Mr Russells demand for justice to be done is more to do with the latest opinion poll, showing support for Scottish independence now standing at  per cent, rather than any real concern for Mr Salmond and the justice system.Ruth Marr, Stirling.It is touching to witness Peter A Russells eagerness to see Alex Salmond obtain justice for himself and Scotlands criminal justice system. In support, he cites the observations of another two of yesterdays men, Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill.I am afraid that the latter lost a lot of my respect due to his handling of the Al-Megrahi situation. Dr Jim Swire tirelessly pursued the need for a review of the case providing evidence of several flaws in the trial in the Hague carried out under the jurisdiction of the Scottish justice system. Mr MacAskill refused to accept that there was any doubt as to Al-Megrahis guilt and he defended the Crown Prosecution services evidence virtually without question. Thereafter, he could not arrange the transfer of the convicted man to Libya quickly enough. This may well have been the start of the downturn of his own political career.It saddens me that Mr Salmond and the others cannot accept their diminished influence in the SNP and appear intent on undermining the cause of independence that they have worked so hard to deliver. The former party leader has been cleared of all charges against him even though his reputation has been tarnished by some of his own admissions during the trial. He has little to gain from washing any dirty linen in public, an outcome which Mr Russell is clearly hoping will damage the cause of independence which he hates so much.Gordon Evans, Burnside.I PREFACE my comments by saying there is no acceptable level for crimes against the person including sexual assault and rape. However, itrsquos appalling and a sad indictment of pathetic state of the opposition at Holyrood that Tory MSPS Liam Kerr would attempt to make political capital out of a blip in Julyrsquos sexual crime statistics . When taken in conjunction with the previous three months the levels of sexual crimes are actually substantially reduced.If Mr Kerr believes Police Scotland is underfunded then perhaps he could do something constructive and ask his masters in Westminster to increase the Block Grant after all what Westminster begrudgingly gives Holyrood to run the country is less than half the revenue generated in Scotland.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ON Friday Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard delivered a keynote speech, unveiling plans to transform the Scottish economy.

All of them have been declared as signs that the momentum is with Yes and the same inevitably happened this week with the polls showing Yes on % and %. Forgive meI donrsquot get overly excited.But we shouldnrsquot be unduly cynical either. In private, senior figures in the SNP say the tipping point they really need is % and one of the first steps towards achieving % is saying you have momentum, whether itrsquos true or not. Itrsquos the faith factor that can attract believers which is why Nicola Sturgeon keeps doing it and was doing it again this week. The new polls, she said, showed that ldquothe momentum is very clearly with us.:Veteran SNP MSP calls for complete re-write of independence caseThe second step in the process, the other factor you need to reach %, is capitalising on the momentum you actually have, but thatrsquos a tricky one for the SNP because itrsquos not clear whatrsquos causing the recent rise in support. It could be Brexit, but then again the SNPrsquos big hope in  was that the result of the EU referendum would lead to a surge for them but it pretty much failed to materialise. Indeed, the First Ministerrsquos attempts to link Brexit with a second independence referendum led to the SNP suffering big losses at the General Election in .Alternatively, the latest encouraging polls for the SNP could be down to coronavirus and the fact that people seem pleased with the SNPrsquos handling of it. Ms Sturgeon says herself she believes this to be a factor ndash ldquoshow not tell she calls it ndash but itrsquos a hard trend to capitalise on isnrsquot it  If it was Brexit fuelling support for Yes, the SNP could keep on capitalising on itthe economy suffers. Butitrsquos coronavirus thatrsquos boosting support, the crisis will eventually fade and it may take some of the new support with it.Stage three on the road to % ndash building momentum beyond your core groups ndash is also quite hard to work out. Itrsquos clear that most of the sht from No to Yes has happened among Labour voters the firmest support for Yes is also still clustered around cities and the more deprived parts of those cities. But to get independence to the -plus zone that devolution reached  years ago, you need the momentum to get beyond those hard cores.Ms Sturgeon acknowledged this herself in  when she said that what really built the momentum for devolution in the s was the involvement of people beyond party politics. ldquoThe churches, trade unions, writers, artists, business people, she said, ldquothey all had their say and they were driving forces in building the momentum that led Labour to promise a referendum and the people of Scotland to vote for a Parliament with tax ying powers. If the SNP is to get % for independence, it needs the same kind of trend.But itrsquos stage four that could really take the Yes side over the line because itrsquos often the point where the process is almost impossible to reverse. Behaviourists call it ldquosocial herding and what it means is that when a politician or cause appears to be popular, people will gravitate towards it because itrsquos popular therersquos also a certain part of the electorate that will want to be on the winning side. Again, you saw some of that in the s with devolution it got to the point whereyou didnrsquot support a Scottish Parliament, you were a bit of a freak and itrsquos not always easy to stick to a beliefyou think everyone  thinks dferently. Itrsquos social herding that will take us over the line to  plus.Which leaves the question of where Scotland actually is in the four-stage process and I think the answer to that is not as far as some in the SNP think. Therersquos no denying the upward trend for Yes, and therersquos probably been a sht because of coronavirus, but we will have to wait to seethe SNP really is in stage two and can capitalise on whatrsquos happening.As for stage three ndash reaching out beyond the hard core ndash again therersquos not much evidence yet of support changing except in the soft middle which wersquove known for a while now is prone to shting back and forth. Itrsquos also worth remembering political scientist John Curticersquos point that support for Yes may come down again under the sustained attack there will be on independence in the event of a second referendum. In other words, momentum can go down as well as up.:SNP call for Russia to respect Ukraines independenceAnd therersquos another factor which may be more important than momentum anyway. As Irsquove already pointed out, who you are and where you live was a massive factor in how you voted on independence: well-off areas voted No, poorer areas voted Yes. But demographics change and, in the end, this could be whatrsquos really critical for the independence case.First, coronavirus and Brexit will make a lot of us poorer and nationalism does well in economies that are struggling ndash so the harder le gets for people, the more likely they are to be tempted by Yes. But secondly, support for independence is higher among under-s than it is among older people and the laws of demographics are clear on that one: the second group is going to get smaller. Political views can change as you age of course, but the demographic destiny looks undeniable.The question of momentum is much less certain. I know Nicola Sturgeon says she has it, but she said the same thing in  and  and look what happened then. But there are signs of change and as soon as therersquos an indication that the coronavirus effect is sticking or that support for independence is reaching beyond the hard core, thatrsquos when the momentum could really get going.

A comprehensive revaluation should be set in hand which would give the basis both for a fairer property tax and for a land value tax, both to be introduced within five years. Local authorities should also be permitted a wider range of local taxes, which could include a tourist tax and workplace parking levies. Community councils should be enabled as of right to levy a small precept on the council tax instead of being dependent on local authority handouts. The balance of council income would come from the Scottish Government, which controls income tax levels, and would be at a iable level so that richer areas would receive less per head of population than poorer areas.This approach, primarily taxing land, property and income, would mean that Scotland could have a fairer and more progressive taxation system even within the constraints laid down by Westminster.David Mumford, Dunbar.NOT SO GREENYOU report on SSE Renewable`s new Viking wind farm near Shetland.

Despite some bold action, last week the Scottish Government published their second annual progress report revealing that one in four children are still trapped in poverty.We all know that this is unacceptable. We know that this can change because we have done it before. But to achieve real change in the circumstances we now face will require a signicant increase in the scale and impact of investment across three main areas ndash employment, social security, and housing.The Scottish Government is right to highlight that independent forecasts, published in , predicted that child poverty rates would increase by , largely in response to UK Government welfare reforms. While child poverty rates may have stabilised before the pandemic, we expect an economic storm to create greater risks. Those of us restless for no child to grow up in poverty must not lose our resolve.The roll back of UK Government furlough and self-employment support schemes will see further income shocks and stronger headwinds for families in the Autumn. We are expecting to see unemployment rise and rising debt levels as families grapple with the gap between falling incomes and additional costs, with many risking falling behind with rents and mortgages.At the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, we are deeply concerned at the degree of financial strain and uncertainty felt by many families. Currently, seven in  families with children on low incomes are having to cut back on essentials. Families who were already struggling to keep their heads above water are now feeling the full force of the economic storm caused by Covid-.It is imperative that we put in place a stronger leline for these families now or we risk making the challenge of tackling child poverty in Scotland much harder in the future.Many positive steps are already being taken ndash but together their impact does not rise to the scale of the challenge we face nor provide enough targeted support for families.Our first priority must be to avoid rising unemployment leading to a surge in poverty. Government and employers need to work in partnership to urgently create new good jobs and equip Scots with the skills they need to access them.While the UK Governmentrsquos Kickstart scheme will play a key role in guaranteeing young people work for at least twelve months, itrsquos vital that this support is extended to over-s and other groups who already faced additional barriers in the jobs market before the recession.Extra resources being committed to the Parental Employment Support Fund over the next year offer potentially crucial support to help parents find the best combination of hours, earnings, and childcare to improve their prospects. To be effective, we need to see better alignment between local economic development strategies and this investment ndash boosting the supply of, and access to, good quality, flexible jobs with opportunities to progress.Sadly, we know that we are living through one of the deepest economic downturns on record and job losses are inevitable. Therefore, strengthening our social security system so that it protects people from being pulled into poverty and debt will be essential.We welcome the Cabinet Secretary Aileen Campbellrsquos commitment to prioritise the Scottish Child Payment and begin payments to low-income families with children under six by the end of February. However, as local lockdowns and ongoing social restrictions are likely to remain in place for some time, plans must be implemented to ensure that enough support reaches those who are struggling now.Many across Scotland face uncertainty about whether they will be able to access a decent home or keep the one they currently have. It is right that the Scottish Government has indicated it will act to avoid a potential Autumn spike in evictions, by extending legal protections until the end of next March.This is a vital first step, but also needs to be complemented by genuinely affordable rent repayment plans that balance the needs of tenants and landlords. Where this cannot be achieved, the Government should be ready to step in.All that said, there is no route to achieving the child poverty targets without many more families being able to access good quality, social housing. We need the Scottish Government to go well beyond its current plan, by offering greater certainty to the sector and bringing forward a credible plan to deliver affordable homes at scale during the next Parliament.The upcoming Programme for Government offers an opportunity for ministers to set out a clear plan to get us back on course in righting the wrong of child poverty.

The punctuation mark, it has been revealed, is seen as unnecessary and maybe even intimidating by younger people when it comes to social media conversations. Is this the end of the period Letrsquos get some context. How long has the full stop been around In its current form perhaps not as long as you think. The arrival of the printing press in the middle of the th century and the publication of Johannes Gutenbergrsquos Bible formalised punctuation in texts. Before that it had an up and down existence. In the third century BCE a librarian called Aristophanes introduced dots on the page as pauses. But this was of no interest to the ancient Romans who saw no need for spaces or punctuation in writing, mostly because writing was seen as something to be read aloud.It was early Christianity, which was devoted to the written word, that helped revive the idea of punctuation. In the seventh century Isidore of Seville introduced his own system of dots to indicate pauses, including the distintio finalis to indicate an end point.Monks played around with punctuation over the following centuries until printing set the punctuation marks we know today in ink, as it were.So, whatrsquos changed Social media. Text messaging is short and succinct. Itrsquos often only a few words long and punctuation isnrsquot really needed. Hitting send is now the equivalent of the full stop.

Linguists suggest that to the social media generation, it can be seen as abrupt, negative, or even angry.The other interesting Twitter development is the use of the written words ldquoFull Stop to indicate that whatever precedes it settles an argument. In short, the humble periodhas become a tool in debate.Is anything taking the place of the full stop Online, the use of the exclamation mark is increasingly more common as a form of emphasis.

Many retain family and sentimental links to Scotland. Many are domiciled in rUK. Many would seek to become citizens of an independent Scotland, perhaps joint passport-holders. This privilege would be available especially to those born in Scotland but resident in rUK, among whom are my daughter and son.

Michael Russell, the SNPs Constitution Minister, has accused Mr Gove of trying to gerrymander the vote. Gerrymandering is an attempt to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by adjusting district boundaries. Mr Russell alleges, but technically in error, what could be considered a iant of gerrymandering by expanding, or restricting, the voter pool for political advantage. The Scottish Government has engaged in iant gerrymandering by conferring voting rights upon those aged  years or older. The SNP may or may not be content with the outcome to date of such action, but cannot claim innocence.William Durward, Bearsden.APART from Alexander McKayrsquos unnecessary reference to foreigners and his forgetting that several democratic mandates exist for another referendum , there is no justication for people who have moved from Scotland to have a vote on our future.Only those adults who live here and registered to pay income tax to the Scottish Government should have a vote in any Scottish referendum.

Mr McKay can be further assured that should such a referendum take place, he will have a second opportunity to muster further support to vote against Scotland being a sovereign country.

Former Royal Marine Tim Howell, , leapt from the ,ft peak of An Teallach in the north-west Highlands.He plunged down a steep gully for  seconds before deploying his parachute and landing safely on the banks of Loch Toll an Lochain.The UK is challenging for wingsuit jumps because its mountains lack the altitude, vertical profile and suitable landing spots needed to perform a safe jump.But Mr Howell, from Martock, Somerset, has spent years researching UK base jumping sites and there are now more than  known to enthusiasts.Most base jumps involve leaping from the hilltop and briefly freefalling before deploying a parachute.Mr Howell has become the first to complete a wingsuit jump, which involves a longer period of freefall aided by the suit before deploying the parachute.He said: ldquoThere are maybe three main things you need to find a wingsuit base jump site. You need an initial vertical drop of at least m , usually more like m , that is steep enough to fly over after the start height.ldquoThen you need enough overall altitude to make the flight last more than a few seconds ndash so usually more than m .ldquoAnd, of course, you need a good place to land. ldquoIf any of these things are missing or slightly lacking, then you need one of the other iables to have more margin.ldquoFor example,your start height is less than mthen you want the terrain to be very steep underneath so you can have a greater marginyou fly at a greater ratio than the slope.Mr Howell, who is married to fellow base jumper Ewa Kalisiewicz but has no children, says the UK is ldquoundiscovered in terms of base jumping sites.

His research led him to discover the dramatic overhanging pinnacle of An Teallach, known as ldquoLord Berkeleyrsquos Seat, had all the prerequisites for a wingsuit jump. He made the three-hour ascent to the peak several times before making the jump on August , so he could be sure it was safe.ldquoWe had done the hike many times before to recce the location, he said.ldquoThe more time I can spend measuring and calculatingthe flight is possible the more I can feel confident in it all going smoothly.ldquoA technical aspect of the jump is that you are flying straight into a gully, so there is no lsquoescapersquoyou have a bad heading.ldquoI needed to fly out of the gully before turning and flying to the lake to pull my parachute. The only good landing spot was beside the lake.ldquoBefore the jump I was just trying to calm my nerves, knowing that the calculations added up and my training and experience was enough to make this flight with a big enough margin.ldquoIrsquom so happy it went smoothly.

It was going to be tight, but Tim was completely confident it would work.ldquoIn the end Tim made it look comfortable, easily clearing the crux sections of the flight - a testament to the many highly technical training flights hersquod accrued in preparation for this project.Mr Howell believes there will be other locations in the UK suitable for wingsuit base jumps, but is not in a hurry to try them.ldquoYes, there may be other locations, but they might be even more technical than this one, so Irsquom not rushing to do them, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"union-seeks-regular-covid-testing-staff-schools","story":"The GMB union, which represents cleaners, janitors, caterers and pupil support assistants, warned the Education Secretary not to repeat the mistakes seen in social care, where scores of staff fell sick because of inadequate protection and testing.The call came as Nicola Sturgeon announced secondary pupils must start wearing face masks between lessons to help curb the infection.The First Minister said the Government was set to recommend coverings in corridors and other communal areas where social distancing was not possible, but not yet in classrooms.The parent-led Us for Them campaign, which forced ministers to make a U-turn on their plans for part-time learning, said it would oppose the face-covering guidance.The GMB last night wroteto Mr Swinney with the results of a survey of more , of its members who work in Scotlandrsquos schools.It found  per cent believe they should be offered regular testing at work, % did not feel safe at their work and % had seen a suspected Covid case at their workplace.The union said its demand was simple: ldquoTesting kits delivered to every education setting on a weekly basis and staff have the choice to get a routine test in the workplace.GMB Scotland organiser Helen Meldrum said: ldquoOver a week since theof Scotlandrsquos schools, itrsquos clear that many support staff do not feel safe at their work and the overwhelming majority of them want to be able to access a Covid test at work.ldquoIf support staff need to book a test, they must absorb the financial costs and time implications to do so, and for a chronically low-paid workforce with many employed on multiple contracts across multiple workplaces, thatrsquos just not credible.ldquoThe failure over the summer to listen to the voices of school support staff echoes what we witnessed in care earlier this year.

Communism will render the state and its methods of suppression obsolete. People will learn to arrest themselves.Perhaps I was put in mind of that old Cheka-nut because, having ed from the bit of formerly Communist Yugoslavia that is now Croatia, Irsquove been required to arrest myself for a fortnight, not even being allowed out to pick up a pint of milk, and can expect the police to check up on my whereabouts at any hour of the day or night, under penalty of criminal sanctions.In the old days, arrest or police surveillance would have followed travel in the other direction. But itrsquos in the UK that these measures are in place, though Irsquom pretty certain Irsquove come back with nothing more subversive of the political weal or threatening to public health than mosquito bites and the pink tinge that passes for a tanyoursquore from the West of Scotland.For the most part, currentrestrictions on liberty donrsquot much dfer between most Western and Eastern European countries. Indeed, Croatia seems a kind of idyll, where people are behaving fairly normally, though they wear masks on the bus or in shops, and restaurants are especially diligent about wiping down the tables.But itrsquos doing much the same as Italy and Spain did, and the recent rise in the virus is similar to other Continental countries. Restrictions are still widely accepted, evengrumbling has got louder as time goes on, and the inconsistencies in the policies seem more obvious.I took my chances that quarantine might be reintroduced during my stay ndash as did those heading for Spain, or Portugal, or even France ndash and at least wersquore still allowed to question the effectiveness of the ious governmentsrsquo measures to contain coronavirus.Doing so in some other post-Communist regimes, however, seems to be hazardous to health, given the surprising number of doctors in Russia who have fallen out of windows after questioning the countryrsquos Covid strategies. Therersquos a similar intolerance of dissent in Belarus, which today marks the th anniversary of its independence. There, questions of social distancinghave been shunted to the side as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to oppose Alexander Lukashenkorsquos regime.Thatrsquos something you may think an odd response days after an electionit was won with  per cent of the electorate endorsing it, as Mr Lukashenko, in post since , maintains. It seems suspiciously of a piece with Mr Putinrsquos remarkable political longevity, and the unfortunate tendency of his opponents to end up in jail, go down with mysterious poison-related illnesses or fall out of windows.A look at the relative positions of countries that were once Communist suggests that there is quite a ide in the degree to which they now conform to western norms of liberalism, democracy, fair elections, freedom of the press and liberty of the average citizen. Croatia doesnrsquot now feel all that dferent from other Mediterranean holiday destinations ndash and thatrsquos despite the fact that, coincidentally, today also marks the th anniversary of the start of the Siege of Vuko, reminding us that it, and its FRY neighbours, were in a bitter war for much of the s.Things are not politically perfect in the region , but like most previously Communist countries west of Minsk, the Yugosphere nations now look like other European countries. Germany is entirely integrated: Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are mainstream European, indeed EU, countries the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have the dubious distinction of being as familiar to British partygoers on a stag night as Blackpool or Benidorm.They certainly deserve to be compared on most indices of economic and political freedom,not with the UK, France and Germany, with Greece, Italy and Portugal. Even worries about nationalism or corruption in, say, Hungary, are still more like similar concerns about Malta than Azerbaijan.Yet, with the exception of the Baltic states, always western-looking, shrugging off Communism in the early s has not automatically led to freedom for the countries that suffered under it, and the distinction is between post-Communist and post-Soviet nations.On the whole, the Communist countries of Europereacted to its fall by moving towards the democratic and economic principles of the West: capitalism, or at least social democracy that recognises property rights, the importance of free trade, and the rights and freedoms of the inidual.A few are still ldquotransitional or ldquohybrid regimes or, like Montenegro, have drted backwards, but none is like Belarus, Azerbaijan, Russia or the five ldquoStans to the south of it ndash all of which are ldquoconsolidated authoritarian regimes ie, dictatorships.This provides a pretty dramatic illustration of the lie that is so popular with those who still think Communism was a pretty good idea .It turns out that capitalism or neoliberalism or free markets or classical liberal principles do not thinly disguise oppression, but are principles that make their citizens more free and prosperous. Itrsquos when you ditch Communism, but donrsquot make any attempt to replace its flawed ideology with that of the nations that were on the right side of the Cold War that you get genuine oppression, assaults on freedom and the same dictatorial gangsters in charge, just in dferent suits, and on bigger yachts.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shieling-on-Barvas-River-I-F-Grant-Collection-Edinburgh-Central-Library-2-scaled.jpg","title":"digging where we stand memories from the airigh shieling for a post covid new","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOur hyper-globalised, high-octane way of le was stopped in its tracks in a matter of weeks, and many of us found ourselves confined to our local communities, with a great deal of spare time on our hands.The TaD team have – fortunately – been able to continue working from home, and over these past few months I have been lucky enough to have conversations with some of our contributors and their families, speaking about recordings from the past, but naturally reflecting on those times and comparing them with the situation we find ourselves in today.One conversation of note was with a relative of a contributor who was recorded in the early s., the ethnologist and previous TaD columnist, Mairi MacFadyen, referred to Alastair McIntosh’s idea that we should ‘dig where we stand’ in order to find meaning and to regain a ‘sense of place’.Mairi then explains: “The idea is that by researching and learning about our own history and the place we are living, we – as iniduals and as groups – can regain some control over the understanding of our lives and our inter-connectedness..”, or the shieling. – the seasonal moving of livestock and people, still practiced today in many parts of the world including the mountainous regions of Norway, Alpine and sub-Alpine Europe, and the Pyrenees.In the Highlands, the practice was widespread until the early to mid-th century when much of the moorland on which the communites had their shielings were claimed by the landowners and used for sheep runs, and for hunting., where the contributors are well aware of the custom of going to the shieling in their parents’ and grandparents’ generation... # of the sheep.Historically, this allowed the unenclosed crops in the township to grow undisturbed, and it allowed the livestock to take advantage of the superior seasonal grazing on the hills.. – the first day of may.The flitting took a lot of effort, but it was also a time full of excitement, for man and beast:., including cats for hunting the rats, but according to Donald MacDonald, dogs were not taken to the àirigh.On the first day the men would prepare the shieling huts, and the women would prepare a meal for everyone who had helped with the move, before leaving the children and younger women once everything was prepared.In Lewis the people stayed at the àirigh until the beginning of August., and they would come home at the weekends to go to church, often bringing fresh milk with them.. recited here in  by the Rev.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

There were no further deaths announced yesterday but it emerged that one person had been transferred to intensive care. Meanwhile, the number of Covid- positive inpatients across Northern Ireland had dropped from  to nine. It is thought the drop in newly diagnosed cases from  on Sunday to  yesterday is as a result of the discovery of a number of clusters. A health service source said peaks and troughs in the figures are not unexpected and demonstrate that Northern Ireland#s Test Trace Protect system is working efficiently. However, they warned that further spikes are likely.According to the figures released yesterday, , people were tested over the previous  hours, resulting in the  positive cases. The number of people who have tested positive over the last week stands at . Mid and East Antrim and Belfast have had the highest number of positive cases over the last week, with  and  cases confirmed respectively. There were also nine active care home outbreaks yesterday, according to the latest figures. There are concerns that, as the number of cases of Covid- increase, residents of care home residents are more likely to become seriously ill or even die from the virus. Last week, Health Minister Robin Swann was forced to defend the decision to reimpose lockdown measures, including the closure of a food manufacturing plant that had been hit by a cluster. Speaking at a press conference to announce new measures Mr Swann said his experts have warned him to expect a rise in the number of hospital admissions in coming weeks to coincide with the increase in cases. He said: The reason we have nobody in ICU at this minute in time is because the last patient we had in ICU passed away. He didn#t get up and recover and walk out, so let#s not use these stats without forgetting that there#s people and families behind it. Are we overreacting  I want to be in a place where we don#t have to go to another family and tell them they have lost a loved one to Covid-.

At the moment people cannot even apply for a test, she said. I understand some of those young people have been told it could be next year before they will be able to take a driving test.It has also revealed that learner drivers who were due to sit a driving test in Craigavon are being sent to Armagh and Lisburn instead.This situation is untenable and places local motorists at a distinct disadvantage, said Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: The DVA has worked hard to restore services and communicate the facts to all customers. It is vitally important that health and safety is put first while working to minimise disruption.On July  the minister announced that the DVA is planning to resume some practical car and lorry driving tests from September . The DVA holds the contact details of around , driving test candidates who are either key workers, or who had a test booked and cancelled in late March to the end of June. When driver testing resumes around  key workers will be tested first.The DVA estimates it will take six to eight weeks to clear the backlog. A further update will be provided to advise when it is opening its booking system for all new customers.

It stood for Grotesque, Unbelievable, Bizarre and Unprecedented. These were the words used by the then Taoiseach, CJ Haughey on discovering that a murder suspect was found by the police hiding in the home of the government#s own Attorney General. The late Conor Cruise O#Brien felt GUBU summed up the regime of Fianna Fail under Haughey. It was indeed strange times.But that was  and the Republic of Ireland was caught in the battles between Garret- The Good and Charlie Haughey - an Irish version of Flash Gordon#s Emperor Ming! Now it is  and strange times are upon the country again. This time in the form of Covid-.Until recently, it truly was a case of us all being in this together. There was common cause, shared pain, external threat and an uncertain future. But it#s times like this which test the character of a nation. Ireland unlike many countries in Europe has never experienced totalitarian oppression or been clobbered by the iron fist of communism, Nazism or fascism. Following rules doesn#t come easy to those who have a silent but often sneaking regard for the rascal. And yet, when faced with the threat of Covid-, the people, their politicians and the nation did rise to the meet the occasion. It was heartening.Last week on the th and th of August - all that collective effort and spirit was rained on from a high height. A very high height indeed. And of all things to smash the community cohesion was a round of golf with a clumsy finish at the th hole.Of course, the protective cage of us together was well and truly rattled on June  when during the Bobby Storey funeral the Sinn Fein leadership, from the Republic and Northern Ireland decided to give a massive two fingers to ordinary law abiding citizens by flouting en-mass the Covid- restrictions for funerals. But that is the way of Sinn Fein - #ourselves alone# does not mean #we the people# - it is simply means Sinn Fein alone. Rules for other people are not applied to #their# people.But what held things together in the fight against Covid- was the rest of political Ireland standing shoulder to shoulder. Read More Calls grow for Ireland#s EU trade chief to quit over golf dinner furore EU commissioner in ‘profound apology’ over golf dinner Officials ‘watching closely’ after increase in Dublin coronavirus casesMainstream parties in Dail Eireann were at one with their counterparts in the Stormont Assembly. Sinn Fein#s selfishness and loss of credibility would not ruin the fight against the common enemy of Covid-.Then came what is now referred to as #golfgate#. A wholly avoidable, needless, irresponsible and idiotic event which only served to display how self-absorbed, self-indulgent and egocentric the political classes have become. To describe the attendees at the dinner at Clden as moronic would be an understatement. Their excuses for being present were not only laughable and lamentable but as my granny would say about tea weak as dishwater.To paraphrase an expression from the late and much respected, Fine Gael TD John Kelly - these politicians, present and former acted like a mob of footloose carefree teenagers. Only this does a disservice to teenagers who are finding out their mistakes for the first time.Michael Martin, the Taoiseach must now be regarding his coveted role as a poisoned chalice. His personal anger and demonstrable commitment to public service at the thoughtless actions of his colleagues will not assuage the general public.Administrations are usually defined by their early months - usually the first one hundred days. Despite the promise of a competent government led by the combined best talents of Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Green Party, any good work to date has been overshadowed by pettiness, pointless squabbling, sham rows and now, by at best a thoughtlesssense of entitlement by some political elites.The Taoiseach and Tanaiste need to act collectively and decisively. The Irish EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan appears to have lost their confidence. It seem impossible for him to remain in post when the administration of the country which nominated him to the EU has lost faith in his conduct. Mr Hogan shows no sign of resigning.But an obvious way forward is for Mr Varadkar to replace him in Europe. Playing second fiddlewhen he once led the orchestra is clearly not a comfortable role for the former Taoiseach. Varadkar would be much more at home in Strasbourg and Brussels. It would also unshackle Mr Martin from the sulking shadow of his predecessor. Mr Martin is hampered by the presence of his would be nemesis and needs the government to have an injection of new le.The succession of Mr Coveney to the leadership of Fine Gael would bring more stability to the Coalition government, though a new combined role of Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs may not enthuse unionists.A weakened administration and an angry electorate are not a good combination but Sinn Fein will rue their hubris over the Storey funeral. To pardon the expression, they have been wounded by friendly fire from their own side. There is no moral or plausible basis for calling for an election at this time.Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Fein shattered her own well won credibility as a Covid-suffer who could look at people in the eye and sincerely claim that Covid rules are for all, until she partook in what was a essentially political rally for the late Bobby Storey.GUBU could well be resurrected to describe the shenanigans in the Republic of Ireland at the moment but this writer thinks it#s uniqueness demands a new acronym- HOBO - Hypocritical, Offensive, Brazen and Outrageous.

Sinn Feacutein’s Karen Mullan has voiced her ‘disappointment and concern’ at the ‘unwillingness’ of Robin Swann to provide essential funding to keep Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Servicerunning. While the SDLP’s Mark H Durkan said like everything asked for in the North West it has become a ‘whole battle’. He described the service as a ‘huge success’ which has been a literal ‘leline’ to many. Bereaved local families, activists and organisations campaigned for a service of this kind for years. googletag.cmd.push CCIS provides a ‘safe space’ for those in crisis from pm on Thursdays until am on Sundays when many other services are not operational. It is run by Extern NI from the Holywell Building on Bishop Street. People experiencing a mental health crisis are referred to the service by the PSNI and Foyle Search  Rescue or attend of their own volition. Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it.

Thirteen lives were lost when a German bomb overshot its proposed target and hit Messines Park in Shantallow, home to a colony of ex-servicemen who had served in the Great War.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir yesterday announced a u-turn on results, with all pupils now to be given the higher of the grades submitted by their centre or the grade calculated by CCEA Over a third of all AS and A grades given to students by teachers had been originally downgraded by CCEAs standardisation system last week in a move which drew critcisim from schools, parents and pupils. One County Derry school saw  percent of its results downgraded. Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.” Related: COMMENT: Belated U-turn should have come last week  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose.

Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

Yet for all the hoopla underpinning Sinn Fein’s our-day-will-come project their so-called ‘inevitable’ unity cannot be taken for granted. Likewise, Micheál Martin’s ‘beefed-up’ Shared Island Unit may have irked unionism a couple of weeks ago, but even he would admit that there is nothing inevitable about a united Ireland. But regular readers will know that I’m a be-ready-for-all-outcomes-and-possibilities kind of guy. I’ve said many, many times that I’m an unambiguous, unapologetic unionist and I can conceive of no circumstance in which I would swap my citizenship of the United Kingdom for citizenship of a united Ireland. That said, I’m not afraid of a debate on the subject and I have no objection to any party which wants to make the case for unity by entirely democratic means. I’m aware there are unionists who believe taking part in the debate risks conveying the impression you think unity has become a serious possibility. Yet in not taking part – or failing to even make your own case from a separate  – there’s also the risk of allowing your political opponents to gain traction. The problem, as we now know, is that once that happens it becomes very dficult to catch-up with your own counter-message and narrative, let alone gain an edge and take the lead in terms of input and impact. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Peter Robinson and Mike Nesbitt at the announcement of the subsequently short-lived Unionist Forum in January I noted in the column a couple of weeks ago that John Hume had more specic, lasting influence on successive UK governments than had any unionist equivalent. That’s because he took his case – at a time when people were barely even listening to local nationalism, because the electoral gap between unionism and non-unionism was so wide – to anyone and everyone who would open a door and incline an ear in London, Dublin, Washington or Brussels . That’s why so much of what used to be mocked by unionists as ‘Hume-speak’ found its way into government policy and subsequent political initiatives.With Northern Ireland’s centenary just around the cornerthere are a number of issues for unionists to consider. A centenary celebration will, by its very nature, focus attention on the past but it also involves surveying the presentand preparing for the future.In terms of the challenges unionists face, here are a number off the top of my head. The clash between the competing nationalisms across the United Kingdom the surge, influence and interests of a rebooted English nationalismthe rise of Scottish nationalism and Sinn Fein the combined impact of finally leaving the EU without a deal and the massive economic hit the UK has already taken from the pandemic the closing electoral gap between unionism and nationalism in Northern Ireland the rise of what can best be described as the ‘other’ demographic in Northern Ireland and how it can be kept within the pro-UK camp the outcome of an independence referendum in Scotlandand, of course, the looming shadow of a border poll .In September , at a dinner celebrating the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, Peter Robinson spoke about creating a Council for the Union to prepare for the  celebrations. Now, unless it is meeting and preparing and planning well below the radar I’m not aware of anything on the scale of which he was talking. And while it’s true that he and Mike Nesbitt jointly convened a Unionist Forum in January it is also true that it collapsed within a few months – with quite a few cross words.At this point I have no ideawhat Boris Johnson imagines will emerge from his Forum and Panel discussions. I don’t knowhe has given them a steer or an outline from which to work, orhe just intends to let them do their own thing as long as they provide him with an opportunity to do one of his rambling, hand-me-down Churchillian addresses to the nation. My fear – and it isn’t just a passing one, by the way – is that his references to Northern Ireland and ‘Ulster’ unionism will be so ambiguous and let’s-not-offend-anyone-at-all as to be utterly meaningless.In  Brian Faulkner fronted a three-day debate in the NI Parliament to mark the first half-centenary. In the absence of a unionist majority in the Assembly I’m not sure Arlene Foster would even consider such a debate. There’s no unionist majority in Belfast City Council, either so no cheerleading for the Union there. Who knows what Covid- restrictions might still be imposed upon us in the first six months of , orpublic celebrations of the Unionwill even be possible.Yet whatever happens it strikes me as essential that a united, coherent, pro-Union, pro-UKmessage is heard from unionism within Northern Ireland. Yes, we have serious challengesand issues from which we would be extraordinarily stupid to shy away but our identity, citizenship, political beliefs and sense of belonging to a pan-UK family is worth commemorating and celebrating.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Instead, Sykes, formerly of Glenavon and now contracted to Oxford United in England, is switching his allegiance to the Republic of Ireland. It is a bitter blow for Baraclough, not least because he knows Sykes so well, having managed him for a y spell as Northern Ireland’s under- manager. It is even suggested that Sykes was earmarked to succeed Steven Davis in midfield when the captain hangs up his international boots.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...There are several key points to consider. Firstly, there are the Uefa and Fa laws that have allowed Sykes to change allegiance to the Republic at this late stage despite Northern Ireland having invested in his development over many years. Surely it makes sense for the football authorities to change the rules, insisting that once you play for a country at under- level you must follow through to full international level.  Also, previous Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill was critical of the Football Association of Irelandover attempts to lure young players born north of the border to the Republic. Sykes is not the first player to make the switch. James McClean and Marc Wilson are among those born in Northern Ireland who ended up playing for the Republic, though during O’Neill’s hugely successful spell as manager, high-profile defections largely stopped. Baraclough might now face a stf task to retain talent. A rule change from football’s administrators would help him. \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

How is it we have endured this ridiculous situation of our media fawning over foreign politicians we know nothing about for over four years now Secondly, the closeness of  Brexit vote, and the situation in Northern Ireland and Scotland have repeatedly been cited as reasons for a “soft Brexit”, and even as reason to entirely negate Brexit. Yet let’s look to Ireland’s  General Election. Repeatedly this is cited by republicans as giving total validation for Easter , justication for violence, and a mandate for a total and complete hard separation from Britain.Republican commentators, historians, and activists tell us that by a “landslide” Sinn Fein won a majority of the seats in Ireland, save but for the north-east of the island held by unionists. The reality is that republicans won  out of the  seats , but did so with just % of the vote. Did republicans work for a soft break with London that maintained links and good relations Of course not. The republican leadership of the time fought ferociously for the hardest of hard breaks. There was no regard for the % who didn’t vote for them.Further, there was to be no paying of debts and the leaders would go on to erect trade barriers which only impoverished Ireland. Republican commentators, historians, and activists clamour for a “soft Brexit”, yet they revere and celebrate an Irish history that involved the hardest of hard breaks.
